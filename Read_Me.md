# ðŸ©º AI DoctorBot with RAG

An intelligent medical screening assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using evidence-based medical knowledge.

##  Overview

DoctorBot helps patients better communicate their symptoms before doctor visits by:
- Asking intelligent follow-up questions
- Detecting medical emergencies
- Providing evidence-based assessments
- Citing medical sources for transparency

##  Features

-  **Dual Knowledge Base**: 600-page medical textbook + MedlinePlus (2,333 chunks)
-  **Smart Follow-ups**: 3 contextual questions for better diagnosis
-  **Emergency Detection**: Immediate alerts for critical symptoms
-  **RAG Pipeline**: FAISS + BGE embeddings + GPT-3.5
-  **Source Transparency**: Shows which medical texts informed the response
-  **Clean UI**: Accessible Streamlit interface

##  Quick Start
