Weinstein, MD, MPH \nAssistant Professor \nDivision of General Medicine \nHarvard Medical School \nBoston, Massachusetts \nFatigue \n\nPreface \nOur goal in creating Symptom to Diagnosis was to develop an \ninteresting, practical, and informative approach to teaching the \ndiagnostic process in internal medicine. Interesting, because real \npatient cases are integrated within each chapter, complementing \nwhat can otherwise be dry and soporific. Informative, because \nSymptom to Diagnosis articulates the most difficult process in \nbecoming a physician: making an accurate diagnosis. Many other \ntextbooks describe diseases but fail to characterize the process that \nleads from patient presentation to diagnosis. Although students \ncan, and often do, learn this process through intuition and \nexperience without direct instruction, we believe that diagnostic \nreasoning is a difficult task that can be deciphered and made \neasier for students. Furthermore, in many books the description \nof the disease is oversimplified, and the available evidence on the \npredictive value of symptoms, signs, and diagnostic test results is \nnot included. Teaching based on the classic presentation often fails \nto help less experienced physicians recognize the common, but \nnon-classical presentation. This oversight, combined with a lack \nof knowledge of test characteristics, often leads to prematurely \ndismissing diagnoses. \nSymptom to Diagnosis aims to help srudents and residents learn \ninternal medicine and focuses on the challenging task of diagnosis. \nUsing the &amework and terminology presented in Chapter 1, \neach chapter addresses one common complaint, such as chest \npain. The chapter begins with a case and an explanation of a \nway to frame, or organize, the differential diagnosis. Diagnostic \nalgorithms are presented that give the learner a way of working \nthrough the diagnostic process. As the case progresses, clinical \nreasoning is clearly articulated. The differential diagnosis for that \nparticular case is summarized in tables that delineate the clinical \nclues and important tests for the leading diagnostic hypothesis \nand important alternative diagnostic hypotheses. As the chapter \nprogresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed. Just as in real \nlife, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed \nand diagnoses are confinned or refuted. Readers are continually \nengaged by a series of questions that direct the evaluation. \nSymptom to Diagnosis can be used in three ways. First, it is \ndesigned to be read in its entirety to guide the reader through \na third-year medicine clerkship. We used the Core Medicine \nClerkship Curriculum Guide of the Society of General Internal \nMedicine/Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine to select the \nsymptoms and diseases we included, and we are confident that the \ntext does an excellent job teaching the basics of internal medicine. \nSecond, it is perfect for learning about a particular problem by \nstudying an individual chapter. Focusing on one chapter will \nprovide the reader with a comprehensive approach to the problem \nbeing addressed: a &amework for the differential diagnosis, an \nix \nopportunity to work through several interesting cases, and a revie\nof pertinent diseases. Third, Symptom to Diagnosis is well suited to \nreviewing specific diseases through the use of the index to identify \ninformation on a particular disorder of immediate interest. \nOur approach to the discussion of a particular disease is different \nthan most other texts. Not only is the information bulleted to make \nit concise and readable, but the discussion of each disease is divided \ninto 4 sections. The Textbook Presentation, which serves as a concise \nstatement of the common, or classic, presentation of that particular \ndisease, is the first part. The next section, Disease Highughts, \nreviews the most pertinent epidemiologic and pathophysiologic \ninformation. The third part, Evidence-Based Diagnosis, reviews the \naccuracy of the history, physical exam, laboratory and radiologic \ntests for that specific disease. Whenever possible, we have listed the \nsensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios for these findings \nand test results. This section allows us to point out the findings \nthat help to \"rule in\" or \"rule out\" the various diseases. History \nand physical exam findings so highly specific that they point \ndirectly to a particular diagnosis are indicated with the following \n\"fingerprint\" icon: \n~ \n= fingerprint \nWe also often suggest a test of choice. It is this part of the book \nin particular that separates this text from many others. In the final \nsection, Treatment, we reviethe basics of therapy for the disease \nbeing considered. Recognizing that treatment evolves at a rapid \npace, we have chosen to limit our discussion to the fundamentals of \ntherapy rather than details that would become quickly out of date. \nThe fourth edition has been completely updated through a \ncomprehensive revieof the relevant literature and many chapters \nhave undergone substantial revisions by neauthors. Changes \ninclude nealgorithms and approaches in the chapters on \nChest Pain, Syncope, Dizziness, and others. Recently developed \nnediagnostic tools are discussed in the chapters of Diarrhea, \nJaundice, and Cough and Fever, and neguidelines have been \nincluded in the chapters on Screening, Diabetes, and Hypertension. \nFor generations the approach to diagnosis has been learned \nthrough apprenticeship and intuition. Diseases have been described \nin detail, but the approach to diagnosis has not been formalized. In \nSymptom to Diagnosis we feel we have succeeded in articulating this \nscience and art and, at the same time, made the text interesting to \nread. \nScott D. C. Stern, MD \nAdam S. Cifa, MD \nDiane Altkorn, MD \n\nThis page intentionally left blank \n\nAcknowledgments \nWe would like to thank our coauthors, who nonumber twenty \none, for their hard work in expanding this text. We are grateful \nfor the support of Harriet Lebowitz and James Shanahan at \nMcGraw-Hill, who have helped us throughout this process and \nbelieved in our vision. Thanks to Jennifer Bernstein for her \nmeticulous copyediting. Finally, our patients deserve special praise, \nfor sharing their lives with us, trusting us, and forgiving us when \nour limited faculties err, as they inevitably do. It is for them that \nwe practice our art. \nScott Stern: I would like to thank a feof the many people \nwho have contributed to this project either directly or indirectly. \nFirst I would like to thank my wife Laura, whose untiring \nsuppon throughout the last 42 years of our lives and during this \nproject, made this work possible. My mother, Suzanne Black, \nremained a constant supporter during her lifetime. Other \nmembers of my family have also been very supponive including \nmy children Michael, David and Elena; My father Roben Stern \nand grandmother, Elsie Clamage. Two mentors deserve special \nmention. David Sischy shared his tremendous clinical wisdom \nand insights with me over 10 wonderful years that we worked \ntogether. David is the best diagnostician I have met and taught \nme more about clinical medicine than anyone else in my career. \nI remain in his debt. I would also like to note my appreciation to \nmy late advisor, Dr. John Ultmann. Dr. Ultmann demonstrated \nthe art of compassion in his dealings with patients on a day-to-day \nbasis on a busy hematology-oncology service in 1983. \nxi \nAdam Cifu: Excellent mentors are hard to find. I have been \nfortunate in the mentors who have guided me in my life and my career \nMy parents gave me every opportunity imaginable. Claude Wmtner \ntaught me the imponance of organi7.ation, dedication, and focus and \ngave me a model of a gifted educator. Olaf Andersen nurtured my \ninterest in science and guided my entry into medicine. Carol Bates \nshowed me what it means to be a specialist in general medicine \nand a clinician educator. Halina Brukner has mentored me during \nmy career at the University of Chicago. My fun.Uy, Sarah, Ben, and \nAmelia, always remind me of what is most important. Thank you. \nDianeAltkom: I want to thank the students and house officers at the \nUniversity of Chicago for helping me to continually examine and refine \nmy thinking about clinical medicine and hoto practice and teach it. \nI have been fortunate to have many wonderful mentors and teachers. \nI particularly want to mention Dr. Steven MacBride, who first taught \nme clinical reasoning and influenced me to become a general internist \nand clinician educator. As a resident and junior faculty member, I had \nthe privilege of being part of Dr. Arthur Rubenstein's Department of \nMedicine at the University of Chicago. Dr. Rubenstein's commitment \nto excellence in all aspects of medicine is a standard to which I will \nalways aspire. His kind encouragement and helpful advice have been \ninvaluable in my professional development. Finally, I am grateful \nfor my family. My parents have provided lifelong suppon and \nencouragement. My husband, Bob, is eternally patient and supportive \nof everything I do. And without my children Danny and Emily, my \nlife would be incomplete. \n\nThis page intentionally left blank \nI have a patient with a problem. Hodo I figure out \nthe possible causes? \nDiane Altkom, MD \nTHE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS \nConstructing a differential diagnosis, choosing diagnostic tests, and \ninterpreting the results are key skills for all physicians. The diagnos--\ntic process, often called clinical reasoning, is complex, and errors \nin reasoning are thought to account for 17% of all adverse events. \nDiagnostic errors can occur due to faulty knowledge, faulty data \ngathering, and faulty information processing. While this chapter \nfocuses on the reasoning process, remember that the data you acquire \nduring the history taking and the physical exam, sometimes accom-\npanied by preliminary laboratory tests, form the basis for your initial \nclinical impression. Even with flawless reasoning, your final diagno-\nsis will be wrong if you do not start with accurate data. You must \nhave well developed interviewing and physical examination skills. \nClinicians generally use dual reasoning processes to work \nthrough a case. System I reasoning, relatively rapid and intuitive, \nis based on pattern recognition and involves matching the patient's \npresentation to an illness script, a prior example stored in mem-\nory. System 2 reasoning is a slower process in which the clinician \nuses an explicit analytic approach. System I thinking predominates \nwhen an experienced clinician encounters a straightforward case, \nwith system 2 predominating when the case is more complicated or \nthe clinician is less experienced. Most of the time there is an uncon-\nscious blending of the two systems. Clinicians should be aware of \ncommon biases in clinical reasoning (Table 1-1} and reflect upon \ntheir reasoning processes, looking for potential errors. This chapter \nbreaks down the reasoning process into a series of steps that can help \nyou work through large differential diagnoses, avoid biases, and ret-\nrospectively identify sources of error when your diagnosis is wrong. \nA MODEL FOR CLINICAL REASONING (Figure 1-1) \nStep 1: Identify the Problem \nBe certain you understand what the patient is telling you. Some-\ntimes \"I'm tired\" means \"I become short of breath when I walk\" \nTable 1-1. Common biases in clinical reasoning. \nName of Blas \nAvallablllty \nBase rate neglect \nRepresentativeness \nDescription \nConsidering easily remembered diagnoses \nmore likely Irrespective of prevalence \nPursuing \"zebras\" \nIgnoring atypical features that are \ninconsistent with the favored diagnosis \n--- ------------------ ------------ \nConfirmation bias \nPremature closure \nSeeking data to confirm, rather than refute \nthe Initial hypothesis \nStopping the diagnostic process too soon \nand at other times means \"My muscles are weak.\" Construct a \ncomplete problem list consisting of the chief complaint, other \nacute symptoms and physical exam abnormalities, laboratory test \nabnormalities, chronic active problems (such as diabetes or hyper-\ntension), and important past problems (such as history of bowel \nobstruction or cancer). Problems that are likely to be related, such \nas shortness of breath and chest pain, should be grouped together. \nIt is necessary to accurately identify the problem every time you \nevaluate a patient. \nStep 2: Frame the Differential Diagnosis \nThe differential diagnosis should be framed in a way that \nfacilitates recall. It might be possible to memorize long lists of \ncauses, or differential diagnoses, for various problems. However, \ndoing so would not necessarily lead to a useful organization \nof differentials that helps you remember or use them. Instead, \nit is preferable to use some kind of problem-specific framework \nto organize differentials into subcategories that are easier to \nremember and often clinically useful. Problem-specific frame-\nworks can be anatomic, a framework often used for chest pain; \norgan/system, used for symptoms with very broad differentials \nlike fatigue; physiologic; or based on piYDtal points (defined \nbelow). Each chapter in Symptom to Diagnosis begins with a \nproblem-specific framework for the differential. Using such \nframeworks has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy \nof medical students. \nStep 3: Organize the Differential Diagnosis \nStructuring the differential diagnosis into clinically useful \nsubgroups can enable you to systematically work through the \ndifferential diagnosis. Sometimes the framework that is easiest \nto remember, such as grouping causes of dyspnea as cardiac or \npulmonary, does not facilitate reasoning. Then, reorganizing the \ndifferential in a way that helps you understand the order in which \nto consider various diagnoses is necessary. The most clinically use-\nful differentials are organized using pivotal points, one of a pair of \nopposing descriptors that compare and contrast clinical character-\nistics. Examples include old versus neheadache, unilateral versus \nbilateral edema, and right lower quadrant pain versus epigastric \npain. When pivotal points are used to frame the differential in the \nfirst place, it is not necessary to reorganize the differential to create \na diagnostic algorithm. \nYou can frame and reorganize the differential yourself or find a \nsource that does so in a way that makes sense to you. Each chapter \nin Symptom to Dilzgnosis contains a diagnostic algorithm that uses \npivotal points to highlight logical reasoning pathways for each \nsymptom. Steps 2 and 3 need to be done only once for each clinical \nproblem you encounter; with experience, you will develop a rep-\nertoire of logically framed differentials and structured diagnostic \napproaches to problems you encounter. \n\n2 I CHAPTER 1 \nIdentify the problem \nFrame the dlfferentlal diagnosis In a way that facllltates recall \nOrganize the dlfferentlal diagnosis Into cllnlcally uaetul subgroups \nthat enable you to aystematlcally work through the dlff ... ntlal diagnosis \nLimit the dlfferentlal by using plvotal points to create a patlent-apeclflc dltfwentlal \nExplore the patient ... pecific differential using history and physical exam findings \n(risk factors, auoclated symptoms, phyalcal findings, fingerprints) \nRank the dlfferentlal using the nNIUlta of the axplonltlon \nSelect the leading hypotheals \nSelect the must not miss hypotheaes \nSelect addltlonal actl'tfl \naltematwe hypotlHHlea \nWhat is the most likely diagnosis \nbased on prevalence, associated \nsymptoms, fingerprints, risk factors? \nWhich diagnoses are life-threatening and \nmust not be missed? \nWhich diagnoses are reasonably \nlikely or very common? \nTest your hypoth .... \nWhich tests have very high likelihood ratios and can rule in a disease? \nWhich tests have very lolikelihood ratios and can rule out a disease? \nYes \nTreat \nRe-rank the differential bued \non the nedata \nSelect a ne\nleading hypotheses \nSelect nealternative \nhypotheses \nTest your nehypotheses \nNo \nFigure 1-1. A model for clinical reasoning. \nStep 4: Limit the Differential Diagnosis \nSince every disease in a differential may not be rdevant to an indi~ \nvidual patient, using piwtal points to create a patientspeci.6.c \ndifferential diagnosis can help narrothe list. Extracting pivotal \npoints from the history and physical exam enables the clinician \nto limit a large, complete differential diagnosis to a more focused \nset of diagnoses pertinent to that particular patient. This step, and \nYes \nTreat \nsteps 5 through 9, should be included in your clinical reasoning \nfor all patients. \nStep 5: Explore Possible Diagnoses Using \nHistory and Physical Exam Findings \nThe next step is to look for clinical clues that point toward the most \nlikely diagnosis. Does the patient have risk factors for a particular \n\ndiagnosis? Does the patient's description of the symptom suggest a \nlikdy cause? What have you observed on physical exam? Focus on \nthe positiv~positive finding.r on history or physical exam art: impor-\ntant (65% of positive findings have a specificity> 80% and 43% \nof positive findings have a specificity > 90%). One-third have an \nLR+ > 5, and 16% have an LR+ > 10. Some very specific findings \nstrongly suggest a specific diagnosis because they are rarely seen \nin patients without the disease, just as fingerprints point to a spe-\ncific person because they are not seen in more than 1 individual. \nSuch \"fingerprint\" fmdings will be marked with the symbol \"FP\" \nthroughout the book On the other hand, do not be fooled by the \nnegative; \"classic\" finding.r, especially individual finding.r, art: often \nabsent. Only 21 % of negative findings have a sensitivity > 80%, \nand only 11 % of> 90%; just 7% have an LR- of< 0.1. \nStep 6: Rank the Differential Diagnosis \nRank the differential diagnosis using the results obtained in Step S. \nEven in a limited differential, not all diagnoses are equally likely \nor equally important. There are 4 approaches to ranking, or prior-\nitizing, the differential diagnosis for a given problem: possibilistic, \nprobabilistic, prognostic, and pragmatic. \nA. Possibilistic approach: Consider all known causes equally \nlikely and simultaneously test for all of them. This is not a \nuseful approach. \nB. Probabilistic approach: Consider first those disorders that are \nmore likely; that is, those with the highest pretest probability, \nthe probability that a disease is present before further testing \nis done. \nC. Prognostic approach: Consider the most serious diagnoses first. \nD. Pragmatic approach: Consider the diagnoses most responsive \nto treatment first. \nClearly, there are limitations to each of these individual \napproaches. Experienced clinicians simultaneously integrate prob-\nabilistic, prognostic, and pragmatic approaches when reorganizing \nand prioritizing a differential diagnosis in order to decide when \ntesting is necessary and which test to order (Table 1-2). Clinicians \nuse their knowledge of pivotal points; \"fingerprints\"; risk factors; \ntypical or \"textbook\" presentations of disease; the variability of dis-\nease presentation; and prevalence and prognosis to select a leading \nhypothesis, must not miss hypotheses, and other active alternative \nhypotheses. \nStep 7: Test Your Hypotheses \nSometimes you are certain about the diagnosis based on the initial \ndata and proceed to treatment. Most of the time, however, you \nrequire additional data to confirm your diagnostic hypotheses; in \nother words, you need to order diagnostic tests. Whenever you do \nso, you should understand homuch the test will change the prob-\nability the patient has the disease in question. \nStep 8: Re-rank the Differential \nBased on NeData \nRemember, ruling out a disease is usually not enough; you must \nalso determine the cause of the patient's symptom. For example, \nyou may have eliminated myocardial infarction (MI) as a cause \nof chest pain, but you still need to determine whether the pain is \ndue to gastroesophageal reflux, muscle strain, aortic dissection, etc. \nWhenever you have not made a diagnosis, or when you encounter \ndata that conflict with your original hypotheses, go back to the \ncomplete differential diagnosis and reprioritize it, taking the ne\ndata into consideration. Failure to reconsider the possibilities is \ncalled premature closure (see Table 1-1), one of the most common \ndiagnostic errors made by clinicians. \nDIAGNOSTIC PROCESS I 3 \nTable 1-2.

She feels slightly feverish but has no \nother symptoms such as chest pain, shortness af breath, or \nabdominal pain. She has been completely healthy except for \nhypertension, osteoarthritis of her knees, and a cholecys-\ntectomy. with no history af other medical problems, surger-\nies, or fractures. Her only medication is hydrochlorothiazlde. \nShe had a normal pelvic exam and Pap smear 1 month ago. \nPhy51ca 1 exam shows that t he circumference of her left calf \nIs 3.5 cm greater than her right calf. and there Is 1 + pitting \nedema. The left calf is uniformly red and very tender. and \nthere is slight tendemess along the popliteal vein and medial \nleft thigh. There Is a healing cut on her left foot. Her temper-\nature Is 37.7C. The rest of her exam is normal. \n~ \nWhat le Ml'5. S'e problem Uet1 \nProblem lists should begin with the acute problems, followed \nby chronic active problems, ending with inactive problems. \nMrs. S's problems are (1) painful left leg edema with erythema, \n\n4 I CHAPTER 1 \n(2) hypertension, (3) osteoarthritis of the knees, and (4) status post \ncholecystectomy. \nStep 2: Frame the Differential Diagnosis \n~ \n~ \nHodo you frame the differential dlagnoele \n,. for edema? \nAs discussed in Chapter 17, Edema, the problem-specific organiza-\ntion of the full differential diagnosis starts with the distribution of \nthe edema: generalized versus unilateral and limb versus localized. \nThe causes of edema are fairly distinct for each of these subcate-\ngories. For instance, heart failure and chronic: kidney disease cause \ngeneralized not unilateral edema. \nStep 3: Organize the Differential Diagnosis \nSince the edema differential is framed using the pivotal point of \nedema distribution, it is not necessary to organize it-step 3 has \nalready been done. \nStep 4: Limit the Differential Diagnosis \n~~ \nWhat are the pivotal polnte In Ml'9. S'e pl\"t!l9t!lf1'ta~ \n,. tlon? Howould you limit the differential? \nMrs. S has acute unilateral leg edema, a pivotal point that leads to \na limited portion of the edema differential. \nDiagnostic possibilities are nonarrowed to a distinct subset of \ndiseases that can be organized using an anatomic framework: \nA. Skin: Stasis dermatitis \nB. Soft tissue: Cdlulitis \nC. Calf veins: Distal deep venous thrombosis (DVf) \nD. Knee: Ruptured Balcer cyst \nE. Thigh veins: Proximal DVf \nF. Pelvis: Mass causing lymphatic obstruction \nStep 5: Use History and Physical Exam \nFindings to Explore Possible Diagnoses \nConsider the risk factors for each of the diagnostic: possibilities as \nwell as their associated symptoms and signs. For example, venous \ninsufficiency is a risk factor for stasis dermatitis, and there may \nbe hemosiderin staining along the malleolar surface on physical \nexam. Cellulitis often follows skin injury, and physical exam shows \nerythema and tenderness. DVf is more frequent in patients with \nunderlying malignancy or recent immobilization, and there may be \nshortness of breath if the clot has embolized. \nStep 6: Rank the Differential Diagnosis \nWhat are the important clinical clUBe in Mre. S'e \npnssentation? Howould you rank and prioritize \ntht!l limlt&I differential? What 15 your leading \nhYJ1C1thael9? What al'fJ your actlws altematlvee? \nMrs. S has a constellation of symptoms and signs supporting the \ndiagnosis of c:ellulitis as the leading hypothesis: fever; an entry \nsite for infection on her foot; and a red, tender, swollen leg. \nEven without risk factors for DVf, the active alternatives are prox-\nimal and c:alfDVf, being both common and \"must not miss\" diag-\nnoses. If c:ellulitis and DVf are not present, ruptured Balcer cyst \nand a pelvic mass should be considered. Finally, stasis dermatitis \nis excluded in a patient without a history of chronic: leg swdling. \nHocertain ans you that Mre. S hae cellulltl11? \nShould you treat her with a ntlblotlce? Ho\ncertain ans you that ehe dose not have DVT? \nShould you teet for DITT \nTHE ROLE OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING \nStep 7: Test Your Hypotheses \nOnce you have generated a leading hypothesis, with or without \nactive alternatives, you need to decide whether you need further \ninformation before proceeding to treatment or before exclud-\ning other diagnoses. One way to think about this is in terms of \ncertainty: hocertain are you that your hypothesis is correct, and \nhomuch more certain do you need to be before starting treat-\nment? Another way to think about this is in terms of probability: \nis your pmest probability of disease high enough or loenough \nthat you do not need any further information from a test? \nDetermine the Pretest Probability \nThere are several ways to determine the pretest probability of your \nleading hypothesis and most important (often most serious) active \nalternatives: use a validated clinical decision rule (CDR), use prev-\nalence data regarding the causes/etiologies of a symptom, and use \nyour overall clinical impression. \nA. Use a validated CDR \n1. Investigators construct a list of potential predictors of a \ndisease, and then examine a group of patients to determine \nwhether the predictors and the disease are present. \na. Logistic regression is then used to determine which \npredictors are most powerful and which can be omitted. \nb. The modd is then validated by applying it in other \npatient populations. \nc:. To simplify use, the clinical predictors in the model are \noften assigned point values, and different point totals \ncorrespond to different pretest probabilities. \n2. CDRs are infrequently available but are the most precise \nway of estimating pretest probability. \n3. If you can find a validated CDR, you can come up with an \nexact number (or a small range of numbers) for your pretest \nprobability. \nB. Use information about the prevalence of etiologies for a symptom. \n1. You can sometimes find this information in textbooks or \nreviearticles. \n2. It is important to assess the quality of any studies you find \nbefore using the data. \nC. Use your overall clinical impression. \n1. This is a combination of what you knoabout disease \nprevalence and the match between the expected history \n\nand physical with that of the patient, mixed with your \nclinical experience, and the ever dusive attribute \"clinical \njudgment.\" \n2. This is just as imprecise as it sounds, and it has been shown \nthat physicians are disproportionately influenced by their \nmost recent clinical experience. \n3. Nevertheless, it has also been shown that the overall \nclinical impression of experienced clinicians has significant \npredictive value. \n4. Clinicians generally categorize pretest probability as low, \nmoderate, or high. This rather vague categorization is \nstill helpful. Do not get distracted thinking a number is \nnecessary. \nConsider the Potential Harms \nConsider the potential harms of both a missed diagnosis and \nthe treatment. \nA. It is very harmful to miss certain diagnoses, such as MI or \npulmonary embolism, while it is not so harmful to miss \nothers, such as mild carpal mnnel syndrome. You need co \nbe very cenain that life-threatening diseases are not present \n(that is, have a very lopretest probability), before excluding \nthem without testing. \nB. Some treatments, such as thrombolytics, are more harmful \nthan others, such as oral antibiotics; you need to be very \ncertain that potentially harmful treatments are needed \n(that is, the pretest probability is very high) before prescribing \nthem without testing. \n0% I \nTest thrBShold \nFigure 1-2.

Mr. B's threshold model. \nDIAGNOSTIC PROCESS I 5 \nTHE THRESHOLD MODEL: CONCEPTUALIZING \nPROBABILITIES \nThe ends of the bar in the threshold model represent 0% and \n100% pretest probability. The treatment threshold is the prob.-\nability above which the diagnosis is so likely you would treat the \npatient without further testing. The test th.rcshold is the probabil-\nity belowhich the diagnosis is so unlikely it is excluded without \nfurther testing (Figure 1-2). \nFor example, consider Ms. A, a 19-year-old woman, who com-\nplains of 30 seconds of sharp righMided chest pain after lifting a \nheavy box. The pretest probability of cardiac ischemia is so lothat \nno further testing is necessary (Figure 1-3). \nNoconsider Mr. B, a 60-year-old man, who smokes and has \ndiabetes, hypertension, and 15 minutes of crushing substernal \nchest pain accompanied by nausea and diaphoresis, with an ECG \nshowing ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads. The pretest \nprobability of an acute MI is so high you would treat without \nfurther testing, such as measuring cardiac enzymes (Figure 1-4). \nDiagnostic tests are necessary when the pretest probability of \ndisease is in the middle, above the test threshold and belothe treat-\nment threshold. A really useful test shifts the probability of disease \nso much that the posttest probability (the probability of disease \nafter the test is done) crosses one of the thresholds (Figure 1-5). \nTest and treatment thresholds vary depending on the seriousness \nof the disease, the toxicity of the treatment, and the invasiveness \nof the test. For example, the treatment threshold for bacterial men-\ningitis is low: it is a potentially fatal disease and antibiotics are a \nrelatively nontoxic treatment. Treatments for lung cancer (such \nas chemotherapy or radiation therapy) have considerable toxicity, \nI \nTreatment \nthreshold \n,, \nTreatment \nthreshold \n\" \nTreatment \nthreshold \n100% \n100% \nI \n100% \n-  I \nMr. B's pretest probability \n\n6 I CHAPTER 1 \n0% \nPosttest \nNegative test \nPretest \nprobability \nprobability \nTest threshold \nFigure 1-5.

The \nlikelihood ratio (LR), the likelihood that a given test result would \noccur in a patient with the disease compared with the likdihood \nthat the same result would occur in a patient without the disease, \nenables you to calculate homuch the probability will shift. \nThe positive likelihood ratio (LR+) tells you holikely it is that \na result is a true-positive (TP), rather than a false-positive (FP): \nLR+ = lP/lolal with DVT = % 1P \nsellllllVlty \n0.96 \nFPllDtal wllhout DVT \n'YaFP \n1-speclllclly 0.02 \nPositi\"We LRs that are significantly above 1 indicate that a \ntrue-positive is much more likely than a false-positive, pushing you \nacross the treatment threshold.

The thresh-\nold model in Figure 1-8 incorporates LRs and illustrates hotests \ncan change disease probability. \nWhen you have a specific pretest probability, you can use the \nLR to calculate an exact posttest probability (see Box, Calculat-\ning an Exact Posttest Probability and Figure 1-9, Likelihood Ratio \nNomogram).

Step 3: posttest probability= posttest odds/ \n(1 + posttestodds) = 0.008/(1 + 0.008) = \n0.008/1.008 = 0.008 \nSo, Mr5. S's posttest probability of proximal DVT \nls0.8%. \nI have a healthy patient. Hodo I determine \nwhich screening tests to order? \nDiane Altkom, MD, & Elizabeth Schulwolf, MD, MA \nPATIENT \nMr. S is a healthy 45-year-old whrte man who wants to be \n\"checked for everything. \nHodo you knowhen it le worthwhile to \nec:reen for a diNaee1 Where do you find \nInformation on ecreenlng guidelfnH1 Hodo \nyou Interpret screening guidelinH1 \nIt seems intuitive that it is best to prevent a disease from occurring \nat all and next best to diagnose and treat it early. However, there are \nrisks and benefits to every intervention, and it is especially impor-\ntant to make sure an intervention is not going to harm a healthy \nindividual. This chapter focuses on understanding the reasoning \nbehind current screening practices. \nA. Screening can be used to identify an unrecognized disease or \nrisk factor in a seemingly well person. \nB. Screening can be accomplished by collecting a thorough \nhistory, performing a physical examination, or obtaining \nlaboratory tests. \nC. Examples of screening include mammography and cholesterol \ntesting. \n1. Mammography can detect unrecognized, asymptomatic \nbreast cancer. \n2. Cholesterol testing can be used \na. To identify high-risk individuals who do not yet \nhave coronary disease (called primary prevention by \nclinicians). \nb. To prevent complications in patients with known \ncoronary disease {called secondary prevention by \nclinicians, not actually screening}. \nD. The following criteria are helpful in determining whether \nscreening for a disease is worthwhile: \n1. The burden of disease must be sufficient to warrant \nscreening. \na. Screen only for conditions that cause severe disease, \ndisability, or death. \nb. Consider prevalence of target disease and ability to \nidentify high-risk group, since the yield of screening \nis higher in high-risk groups. \n2. The test used for screening must be of high quality. \na. Screening tests should accurately detect the target \ndisease when it is asymptomatic. \nb. Screening tests should have high sensitivity and \nspecificity. \nc. Test results should be reproducible in a variety of \nsettings. \nd. Screening tests must be safe and acceptable to patients. \ne. Ideally, screening tests should be simple and shown to \nbe cost effective. \n3. There should be evidence that screening reduces morbidity \nor mortality. \na. There must be effective treatment for the target disease. \nb. Early detection followed by treatment must improve \nsurvival compared with detection and treatment at the \nusual time of presentation; in other words, people in \nwhom the condition was diagnosed by screening should \nhave better health outcomes than those in whom the \ncondition was diagnosed clinically. \nc. The benefits of screening must outweigh any adverse \neffects of the screening test, treatment, or impact of \nearly diagnosis. \nd. Ideally, benefits and harms are evaluated through a \nrandomized trial of screening (Figure 2-1). \n(1) The best outcome to measure is either all-cause \nmortality or disease-specific mortality, such as \nbreast cancer or prostate cancer mortality. \n(2) Outcomes such as cancer stage distribution \n(ie, whether there are more or fewer early-stage \ncancers found) and length of survival after \ndiagnosis can be misleading because of lead time \nand length time biases. \n(a) Lead time bias: If early treatment is not more \neffective than later treatment, the duration of \nRandomize \nhealthy Sl&:>jects \nScreening test performed \nTreat earty \ndsease found \nby screening test \nMeasure disease specific \nand total mortality rates \nNo screening performed \nTreat disease at time \nof clinical presentation \nMeasure disease specific \nand total mortality rates \nFigure 2-1.

Lead time bias. (The total survival times for the unscreened patient and the screened patient in \nwhom early treatment is not effective are the same. The total survival time for the screened patient in whom \nearly treatment is effective is lengthened.) \ntime the individual lives with the disease is longer, \nbut the mortality rate is the same (Figure 2-2). \n(b) Length time bias: Cancers that progress rapidly \nfrom onset to symptoms are less likely to \nbe detected by screening than slow-growing \ncancers, so that screening tends to identify a \ngroup with a better prognosis. \ne. Often, screening decisions are made based on less \ndirect evidence, such as cohort or case-control studies. \nGiven the biases inherent in these study designs, this is \nsuboptimal and has led to the institution of screening \nprograms that provide no benefit. \n~ \n~ \nWhere do you flnd Information on 5ereenlng \n,.. guldellnes? \nBecause of the complexity and rapid evolution of the evidence \nunderlying screening recommendations, most physicians rely on \npublished guidelines to inform them about screening decisions. \nGuidelines are developed and updated by a variety of organiza-\ntions. It is important to be familiar with different sources of guide-\nlines and to understand hoto access the most recent versions of \nguidelines. \nA. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) \nI. Web site: http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/ \n2. An independent panel of experts in primary care and \nprevention, nounder the aegis of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) \n3. Supported by outside experts, several evidence-based \npractice centers, and university centers that help identify \nhigh-priority topics, produce S}'litematic reviews, and draft \nguidelines. \n4. USPSTF guidelines often form the basis of clinical \nguidelines developed by professional societies. \n5. Highly evidence-based recommendations on when and \nhoto screen \nB. Professional/specialty societies \nI. Often do their own independent reviews and issue their \nown guidelines regarding relevant diseases \n2. Specific guidelines generally available through the society \nwebsite \n3. Examples include \na. Specialty societies (eg, American College of Physicians \n[internal medicine], American College of Obstetrics and \nGynecology, American College of Surgery) \nb. Subspecialty societies (eg, American Thoracic Society, \nAmerican College ofRheumatology, American Urologic \nAssociation, American College of Gastroenterology, \nAmerican College of Cardiology) \nc. Others (eg, American Cancer Society, American \nDiabetes Association, National Osteoporosis \nFoundation, American Heart Association) \n~ \nHodo you Interpret ec:reenlng guldellnea? \nThe USPSTF has developed a standardized S}'litem and vocabu-\nlary for evaluating the quality of the evidence addressing screening \nquestions and for grading recommendations. The recommenda-\ntion grade is based on a combination of the quality of the under-\nlying evidence and an assessment of the size of the benefit. This \ngeneral approach is often adopted by other organizations that make \nscreening recommendations. \nA. USPSTF levels of certainty regarding net benefit (net benefit = \nbenefit - harm as implemented in a primary care population) \nI. High: Consistent results from well-designed studies in \nrepresentative primary care populations that assess the effects \nof the preventive service on health outcomes; it is unlikd.y \nthat these conclusions will change based on future srudies. \n2. Moderate: Evidence sufficient to determine the effects of the \npreventive service on health outcomes, but methodologic \n\nissues suc:h as limited generalizability, inconsistent findings, \nor in.adequate size or number of studies exist; these \nconclusions could change based on future studies. \n3. Low: Insufficient evidence to assess effects on health \noutcomes, due to limited number or size of studies, \nflaws in study designs, inconsistency of findings, lack of \ngeneralizability. \nB. Grades of recommendations \n1. Grade A: The USPSTF recommends this service. There is \nhigh certainty that the net benefit is substantial. \n2. Grade B: The USPSTF recommends this service. There is high \ncertainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate \ncertainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. \n3. Grade C: The USPSTF recommends selectively offering \nor providing this service to individual patients based on \nprofessional judgment and patient preferences. There is at \nleast moderate certainty that the net benefit is small. \n4. Grade D: The USPSTF recommends against the service. \nThere is moderate or high certainty that the service has no \nnet benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. \nS. Grade I statement: The USPSTF concludes that the current \nevidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and \nharms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or \nconflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot \nbe determined. \n\nMr. S feels fine and has no medical history.

What is the burden of disease? \n1. 161,360 nediagnoses of prostate cancer in 2017, with \napproximately 26,730 deaths \n2. Second leading cause of cancer death in men in the \nUnited States \n3. Lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis is about 11.0%; \nthe lifetime risk of death is about 2.5%; autopsy studies \nsuggest that more than 20% of men aged 50-59 years \nSCREENING AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE I 11 \nand more than 33% of men aged 70-79 years have occult \nprostate cancer that did not impact their health status. \nB. Is it possible to identify a high-risk group that might especially \nbenefit from screening? \n1. Older age increases the likelihood of prostate cancer but \ndecreases the likelihood of death from prostate cancer \n(due to increased mortality from other causes). \na. 200 cases/100,000 white men aged 50-59 compared \nwith 900/100,000 men older than 70 years \nb. Mortality from untreated prostate cancer is 22-23% in \nmen under the age of71, 12% in men between the ages \nof71 and 81, and only 4% in men older than 81 years. \n2. Black race \na. Higher prostate cancer incidence than white men: \n203.5 vs 121.9 cases per 100,000 \nb. Higher prostate cancer mortality than white men: \n4.2% lifetime risk of prostate cancer death, compared to \n2.9% in Hispanic men, 2.3% in white men, and 2.1 % \nin Asian and Pacific Islander men. \n3. Family history: Relative risk of about 2 for men with a fi.rst-\ndegree relative with prostate cancer; relative risk about 5 if \n2 first-degree relatives affected. \nC. What is the quality of the screening test? \n1. Digital rectal exam (DRE) \na. Sensitivity, 59% \nb. Specificity unknown, but possibly as high as 94%; \nreproducibility poor \nc. Positive predictive value: 5-30% \nd. Neither sensitive nor specific enough to be used as a \nscreening test, although may add to cancer detection \nwhen combined with PSA \n2. PSA \na. For a PSA ~ 4.0 ng/mL, sensitivity is 6S-80%, and \nspecificity is 60-70%. \nb. Positive predictive values {PPVs) vary with PSA level. \n(1) For a PSA of 4-10 ng/mL, the PPV is about 25%. \n(2) For a PSA > 10 ng/mL, the PPV is 42-64%. \nc. Prostate cancer is found in some men even with very \nloPSA levels. \n(1) PSA s 0.5 ng/mL: cancer in 6.6% of men, 12% of \nwhic:h was high grade \n(2) PSA 0.6-1.0 ng/mL: cancer in 10% \n(3) PSA 1.1-2.0 ng/mL: cancer in 17% \n(4) PSA 2.1-3.0 ng/mL: cancer in 24%, 19% of which \nwas high grade \nd. PSA velocity (rate of change in PSA), PSA density \n(PSA per volume of prostate tissue measured on \ntransrectal ultrasound or MRI), and free PSA (ratio \nof unbound to total PSA) are purported to increase \nPSA accuracy, but data are insufficient to recommend \ntheir use. \nD. Does screening reduce morbidity or mortality? \n1. Two large randomized controlled trials of PSA screening \nfound lower grade cancers in the screened group. \n2. The Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) trial of \n76,693 American men aged 55-74 years \na. Annual PSA for 6 years and DRE for 4 years; 97% \nfolloup at 7 years, 67% at 10 years \n\n12 I CHAPTER 2 \nb. 50% of control group screened outside of trial, biasing \nthe results against a positive effect of screening \nc. Increased frequency of diagnosis, but no difference in \nprostate cancer mortality after almost 15 years of folloup. \n3. European trial of 182,000 men aged 50-74 years \na. PSA every 4 years; median follow-up 9 years \nb. Relative risk of prostate cancer death in screened group = \n0.8 (95% Cl, 0.67-0.98); absolute risk reduction= 0.7% \nc. To prevent 1 prostate cancer death, 781 patients would \nneed to be screened and 48 cases diagnosed. \nd. In a separate analysis of just the Swedish patients in the \ntrial, who were screened every 2 years, the relative risk \nof prostate cancer death was 0.56 (95% Cl, 0.39-0.82), \nwith an absolute risk reduction of 0.4; the number \nneeded to screen was 293 and to diagnose was 12. \ne. There was a 30% reduction in the risk of developing \nmetastatic cancer, with an absolute risk reduction of \n3 per 1000 men screened. \n4. Overall, screening programs in men aged 55-69 years \nprevent about 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer and about \n3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer over about 13 years \nper 1 OOO men screened. \n5. To compare benefits and risks of screening, consider \n1000 men aged 55-69 screened with a PSA. \na. 240 men will have an abnormal PSA. \nb. 100 men will have prostate cancer on biopsy \n(1) 25-50 of them will have an indolent cancer that \ndoes not affect their health. \n(2) These men constitute the overdiagnosis group, \nmen whose cancer never would have been \nsymptomatic. \nc. 80 will choose treatment with surgery or radiation \ntherapy, 60 of whom will have either urinary \nincontinence, erectile dysfunction, or both. \nd. 3 cases of metastatic cancer will be prevented \ne. 1-2 prostate cancer deaths will be prevented \nE. What are the current guidelines? \n1. USPSTF (2018) \na. Men ages 55-59 years: Clinicians should discuss \nthe risks and benefits of screening with each patient \nand make an individualized decision {Grade C \nrecommendation} \nb. Men age 70 years and older: Do not screen for prostate \ncancer (Grade D recommendation) \nc. These recommendations apply to all men, including \nblack men and those with a positive family history. \n{l) There are no data indicating whether screening \nwould be more beneficial in high-risk men. \n(2) A decision analysis suggested that PSA screening \nin black men may be more beneficial than in the \ngeneral population and there may be a potential \nmonality benefit for screening before age 55. \n(3) Men who have a first-degree relative who had \nprostate cancer, who developed metastatic prostate \ncancer, or who died of prostate cancer are probably \nthe most likely to benefit from screening. \n2. American Cancer Society (2016} \na. Men in the following age and demographic categories \nshould discuss the risks and benefits of screening with \ntheir physicians: \n(1) Aged 50 years and older with at least 10 or more \nyears of life expectancy who are at average risk for \nprostate cancer \n(2) Age 45 for men at high risk: Blacks and men with a \nfirst-degree relative diagnosed before age 65 \n(3) Age 40 for men with more than 1 first-degree \nrelative diagnosed before age 65 \nb. In men who choose screening: if the PSA is < 2.5 ng/mL, \ntesting can be done every 2 years; otherwise, testing \nshould be done annually. \nF.

Fourth most common cancer in the United States and \nsecond leading cause of death from cancer \n2. About 135,430 diagnoses in 2017, with about 50,260 deaths \neach year \n3. Americans have a 5% lifetime risk of developing colorectal \ncancer; 85% of cases occur after age 50 \n4. 80-95% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous \npolyps, with advanced adenomas defined as those ~ 1 cm \nin diameter or those < km in diameter containing \nat least 25% villous features, high-grade dysplasia, or \ncarcinoma \na. Adenomas are found in 20-53% of adults by age 50. \nb.

Questions that help identify patients at high risk \nfor colorectal cancer. \nHas the patient had colorectal cancer or an adenomatous polyp? \nDoes the patient have an illness, such as inflammatory bowel disease, \nthat increases the risk of colorectal cancer? \nHas colorectal cancer or an adenomatous polyp been diagnosed in a \nfamily member? \nWas it a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or eh ild)? \nAt what age was the cancer or polyp first diagnosed? \nHomany first-degree relatives have been diagnosed? \nd. \"Losensitivity\" tests, such as Hemoccult II have a \nsensitivity of25-38% and specificity of98%. \ne. \"High sensitivity\" tests, such as Hemoccult SENSA, \nhave a sensitivity of64-80% and specificity of87-90%. \nf. Annual screening detected 49% of cancers; biannual \nscreening detected 27-39% of cancers. \ng. A single pand test after a ORE has a sensitivity of9% \nand should never be considered an adequate screening \ntest for colorectal cancer. \n2. Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) \na. Uses an antibody specific to human Hb but has not \nbeen standardized. \nb. For detecting colorectal cancer, sensitivity ranges \nfrom 73% to 88%, with specificities of90-96%; the \nsensitivity is 24% for detecting advanced adenomas. \n3. Stool DNA test \na. Expensive compared to the other stool tests \nb. For detecting colorectal cancer, sensitivity is 92% with \na specificity of 84%; the sensitivity is 42% for detecting \nadvanced adenomas, with a specificity of 87%. \n4. Flexible sigmoidoscopy \na. Examines approximatdy the first 60 cm of the colon; \npatients with polyps are referred for a full colonoscopy. \nb. Only 20-30% of proximal cancers are associated with a \ndistal adenoma. \nc. However, sigmoidoscopy has been found to identify \n66% of men with significant findings in the colon, \nassuming finding a polyp triggers a full colonoscopy; \nonly 55% oflesions in women would be identified \nbecause cancers in women are more often proximal. \nd.

Sensitivity for polyps 6-9 mm = 73-98%, with \nspecificity 89-91 % \nD. Does screening reduce morbidity or mortality? \n1. Guaiac-based FOBT \na. 3 large randomized trials shoreduced colorectal cancer \nmortality. \nb. Relative risk reduction of colorectal cancer death: \n15-33% \nc. Number needed to screen = 217 for annual screening, \n344-1250 for biennial screening \n2. Flexible sigmoidoscopy \na. A meta-analysis of five randomized trials showed that \nthe relative risk of colorectal cancer mortality was \n0.72 in the screened group. \nb. The PLCO Screening Trial randomized nearly \n155,000 persons aged 55-74 to sigmoidoscopy every \n3-5 years or to usual care. The relative risk of colorectal \ncancer mortality was 0.74 in the screened group \n(absolute reduction from 3.9 to 2.9 colorectal cancer \ndeachs/10,000 person years). \n3. Combination guaiac-based FOBT and sigmoidoscopy \na. In 1 randomized trial, more cancers were found with the \ncombination of guaiac-based FOBT and sigmoidoscopy \nvs guaiac-based FOBT alone. \nb. Colorectal cancer mortality was not an endpoint. \n\n4. Colonoscopy \na. No randomized trial data \nb. Several case-control studies have shown lower incidence \nof colon cancer \nc. A 2009 case-control study found a reduction in death \nfor colorectal cancers in the left colon (OR= 0.33) but \nnot the right colon (OR= 0.99); other case-control \nstudies have found similar reductions in both left- and \nright-sided late-stage cancers. \nd. Generally assumed that the mortality reductions seen \nin the FOBT trials is actually due to the follow-up \ncolonoscopies. \nS. CT colonography \na. No randomized trial data available \nb. 1 nonrandomized study showed that rates of detection \nof advanced adenomas + cancers were similar in patients \nscreened with CT colonography (3.2%) compared with \nconventional colonoscopy (3.4%). \n6. Potential harms of screening include the complication \nrates noted previously, complications of sedation used fur \ncolonoscopy, radiation exposure, and patient discomfort. \nE. What are the current guidelines? \n1. USPSTF (2016) \na. Strongly recommends screening average risk men and \nwomen beginning at age 50 years and continuing to age \n75 years, using FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy \n(1) Grade A recommendation \n(2) Insufficient data to assess the benefits and harms \nof CT colonography and feca1 DNA testing as \nscreening modalities (I recommendation) \nb. Recommends against routine screening in adults age \n76-85 years (C recommendation) \nc. Recommends against screening in adults older than age \n85 years (D recommendation) \n2. American Cancer Society (2008) \na. Begin screening at age 50 \nb. Acceptable strategies include annual FOBT alone (either \nguaiac based or immunochemical), stool DNA test every \n3 years, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, colonoscopy every \n10 years, CT colonography every 5 years, or double-\ncontrast barium enema every 5 years. \nc. Imaging procedures that can detect both adenomatous \npolyps and cancer are preferred over stool tests that \nprimarily detect cancer. \n3. American College of Gastroenterology (2009) \na. Begin screening at age 50 in average risk adults and at \nage 45 in blacks; repeat every 10 years. \nb. Begin screening at age 40, repeating every 5 years, \n(or 10 years younger than the age of the youngest \naffected relative) in adults with \n(1) 1 first-degree rdative with colorectal cancer \nor an advanced adenoma c~ 1 cm, high-grade \ndysplasia, villous elements) diagnosed at < 60 years \nof age. \n(2) 2 first-degree rdatives with colorectal cancer or \nadvanced adenomas at any age. \nc.

What is the burden of disease? \n1. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death \nin the United States. \n2. Overall costs of CHD and stroke estimated to be \n$317 billion in 2011-2012. \n3. Lifetime risk of a CHD event, calculated at age 40 years, \nis 49% for men and 32% for women; nearly one-third of \nCHD events are attributable to total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL. \nB. Is it possible to identify a high-risk group that might especially \nbenefit from screening? \n1. High low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and lohigh-density \nlipoprotein (HDL) levels themsdves are independent risk \nfactors for CHD, with the increased risk being continuous \nand linear. \na. For every 38 mg/dL increase in LDL above 118 mg/dL, \nthe rdative risk for CHD is 1.42 in men and 1.37 in \nwomen. \nb. For every 15.5 mg/dL increase in HDL above 40 mg/dL \nin men, the relative risk for CHD is 0.64. \nc. For every 15.5 mg/dL increase in HDL above 51 mg/dL \nin women, the rdative risk for CHD is 0.69. \n\n16 I CHAPTER 2 \nTable 2-5.

Total cliolesterol-HDL ratio \n(1) In men, a ratio~ 6.4 was associated with a 2-14% \ngreater risk than predicted from total cliolesterol or \nLDLalone. \n(2) In women, a ratio ~ 5.6 was associated with a \n25--45% greater risk than predicted from total \ncliolesterol or LDL alone. \n2. Patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease \n(ASCVD), defined as acute coronary syndrome, a history \nof myocardial infarction, stable angina, coronary or other \narterial revasculari7.ation, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or \nperipheral arterial disease, are in the highest risk category. \n3. Patients without established ASCVD should have a global \nrisk score calculated. \na. The American College of Cardiology/ American Heart \nAssociation (ACC/AHA) 2013 guiddines recommend \nthe Pooled Cohort Equations, a risk assessment tool \nthat estimates the 10-year risk of a first ASCVD event, \ndefined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary \nheart disease death or fatal or nonfatal stroke. \n(1) Derived and validated in non-Hispanic whites and \nnon-Hispanic blacks \n(2) Can use the equations developed for non-Hispanic \nwhites in other populations, although risk \nassessments may not be as accurate \n(3) Found at http://clincalc.com/cardiology/ascvd/ \npooledcohort.aspx \n(4) Some studies suggest it overestimates risk; other \nstudies shothat, compared to other calculators, \nit more accuratdy predicts cardiovascular events \nb. The Framingham Risk Score is another commonly \nused calculator available at https://www.mdcalc.com/ \nframingham-coronary-heart-disease-risk-score. \n(1) Validated in populations over age 40 \n(2) Not validated with the 2013 ACC/ AHA guiddines \ndescribed bdow. \nC. What is the quality of the screening test? \n1. Total cholesterol and HDL are minimally affected by eating \nand can be measured in fasting or nonfasting individuals. \n2. Triglycerides may be increased 20-30% by eating and must \nbe measured in the fasting state. \n3. LDL can be directly measured but is most commonly \nestimated using the following equation, which is valid only \nwhen the fasting triglycerides are< 400 mg/dL: LDL = \ntotal cholesterol - (triglycerides/5 + HDL). \n4. Total cholesterol may vary by 6% in day-to-day \nmeasurements, with HDL varying as much as 7.5%; \nclinicians should obtain 2 measurements before starting \ntherapy. \nD. Does screening reduce morbidity or mortality? \n1. In meta-analyses of primary prevention studies of statln \ndrug therapy, including only patients without established \ncoronary artery disease, \na. All-cause mortality is reduced by 14%, with a number \nneeded to treat over 5 years of 138. \nb. Total cardiovascular disease events are reduced by 25%, \nwith a number needed to treat over 5 years of 49. \nc. CHD events are reduced by 27%, with a number \nneeded to treat over 5 years of 88. \n2. No evidence that diet therapy reduces CHD events in \nprimary prevention populations. \nL Maximum expected cliolesterol reduction with diet \ntherapy is 10--20%. \nb. Most trials achieve an average reduction of about 5%. \nE. What are the current guiddines? \n1. USPSTF (2016) \na. The 2016 guidelines focus on who should be prescribed \nstatin therapy, similar to theACC/AHA guidelines. \n(1) The USPSTF recommends periodic assessment of \ncardiac risk factors in persons aged 40-75 years. \n(2) Although the optimal interval for risk assessment \nis unclear, the USPSTF recommends annual \nassessment of BP and smoking, with lipid levels \nevery 5 years; high-risk patients might need more \nfrequent assessment and low-risk individuals less \nfrequent assessment. \nb. Adults without a history of cardiovascular disease \n(CVD) should use a low- to moderate-dose statin for \nthe prevention of CVD events and mortality when all of \nthe following criteria are met: \n(1) They are aged 40 to 75 years \n(2) They have 1 or more CVD risk factors (ic, \ndyslipidemia, diabetes, hypenension, or smoking) \n(3) They have a calculated 10-year risk of a \ncardiovascular event of 10% or greater using the \nACC/AHA calculator (Grade B recommendation). \n\nc. Low-to-moderate dose statins should be considered in \npatients with the criteria listed above and a c:akulated \nrisk of7.5% to 10% (Grade C recommendation). The \nevidence is insufficient to make a recommendation for \nadults 76 years of age and older with no c:ardiovasc:ular \ndisease {Grade I recommendation). \n2. ACC/AHA (2013) \na. The ACC/ AHA issued updated risk assessment \nguiddines in 2013 for patients without ASCVD. \n(1) Adults aged 20-79 should be assessed every \n4--6 years for traditional ASCVD risk factors: \ntotal and HDL cholesterol, systolic: BP, use of \nantihypertensive therapy, diabetes, current smoking. \n(2) Adults aged 40-79 should have an assessment of \nASCVD risk every 4--6 years, using the Pooled \nCohort Equations. \n(3) In sdected individuals in whom there is uncertainty \nregarding initiation of pharmacologic: therapy based \non the Pooled Cohort Equations assessment, one \ncan consider additional risk factors: \n(a) Family history of premature CVD (first-degree \nmale relative< 55 years of age; first-degree \nfemale relative < 65 years of age) \n(b) High sensitivity C-reactive protein ~ 2 mg/L \n(c) Coronary artery calcium score ~ 300 Agatston \nunits or ~ 75th percentile for age, sex, and \nethnicity \n(d) Ankle-brac:hial index< 0.9 \nb. The 2013 treatment guidelines are summarized in \nChapter 23, Hypertension. \n\nYou agree with Mr. S that a fasting l!pld panel Is an Impor-\ntant screening test to do for men over 45, even In the \nabsence of other risk factors. \n~~ \nShould Mr. 5 have a ec:reenfng c:hHt \n~1' radiograph1 \nLung Cancer Screening \nA. What is the burden of disease? \n1. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both \nmen and women. \n2. About 150,000 deaths from lung cancer in 2018, more \nthan the number of deaths from breast, prostate, and colon \ncancer combined. \n3. Prognosis of non-stage I lung cancers is poor. \nB. Is it possible to identify a high-risk group that might especially \nbenefit from screening? \n1. Cigarette smoking is responsible for about 85% oflung \ncancers. \na. Compared with nonsmokers, relative risk of developing \nlung cancer is about 20. \nb. A 65-year-old who has smoked 1 pack/day for 50 years \nhas a 10% risk of devdoping lung cancer over the next \n10 years. \nc. A 75-year-old who has smoked 2 packs/day for 50 years \nhas a 15% risk. \nSCREENING AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE I 17 \n2. Other risk factors include family history of lung cancer \nand exposure to asbestos, nickel, arsenic, haloethers, \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and environmental \ncigarette smoke. \nC. What is the quality of the screening test? \n1. Chest radiograph: sensitivity, 60%; specificity, 94% \n2. CT scan: sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 73% \nD. Does screening reduce morbidity or mortality? \n1. Chest radiograph: 6 randomired trials of c:hest \nradiography, with or without sputum cytology, failed \nto demonstrate a decrease in lung cancer mortality; \nall were limited by the control population undergoing \nsome screening. \n2. CT scan: National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) \na. Over 53,000 asymptomatic persons aged 55-74 with \n~ 30 pack year smoking history; former smokers must \nhave quit within the past 15 years \nb. Exclusions: previous lung cancer, other cancer within \nthe last 5 years, CT scan within the last 18 months, \nmetallic implants in the c:hest or back, home oxygen \nuse, pneumonia, or other acute upper respiratory \ntract infection treated with antibiotics within the last \n12weeks \nc. Randomized to 3 annual screenings with low-dose \nCT scan or single vieposteroanterior c:hest film; an \nabnormal screen was defined as a nodule <!: 4 mm \nd. Lung cancer-specific mortality was significantly reduced \nin the low-dose CT group. \n(1) CT group lung cancer mortality rate = 1.3%, \ncompared to 1.6% in the c:hest film group \n(2) Relative risk reduction = 20%; absolute risk \nreduction of 3 lung cancer deaths per 1 OOO patients \nscreened with CT; number needed to screen to \nprevent 1 lung cancer death = 320 \ne. Nearly 40% of participants had at least 1 positive \nCT result; 96% of these were false-positives. Most false--\npositive results were resolved by follow-up CT scans, \nalthough some patients required biopsies. \nE. What are the current guidelines? \n1. USPSTF (2013) \na. Annual screening with low-dose CT in adults \nages 55-80 who have a 30 pack-year smoking history \nand currently smoke or have quit within the past \n15 years. \nb. Screening should be discontinued once a person has \nnot smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem \nsubstantially limiting life expectancy or ability to have \ncurative lung surgery. \nc. Grade B recommendation \n2. The American College of Chest Physicians recommends \noffering annual screening with low-dose CT to \nasymptomatic: smokers and former smokers age 55-77 \nwho have smoked 30 pack years or more and either \ncontinue to smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. \n3. The American Cancer Society and American Society of \nClinical Oncology (2012) recommend discussing screening \nwith patients who meet the NLST eligibility criteria \ndescribed above. \nF.

What is the burden of disease? \n1. 4-8% of older men and 0.5-1.5% of older women have \nan AAA \n2. AAA accounts for about 9000 deaths per year in the \nUnited States. \na. l~year rupture rates are 9% for AAA.!; 5.5-5.9 cm, \n10% for 6-6.9 cm, and 33% for AAA.!; ~ 7 cm. \nb.

The OR increases by 1.7 for each 7-year age interval. \nb. Current or past smoking increases the risk of AAA by 3--5. \nc. The prevalence of AAA increases more rapidly with age \nin ever smokers than in never smokers. \nd. The prevalence of AAA > 4 cm in never smokers is < 1 % \nfor all ages. \ne. The: OR is 1.94 for a positive: family history. \nf. The 0 R is ~ 1.3-1. 5 for history of coronary artery \ndisease, hypercholesterolemia, or cerebrovascular disease. \ng. The OR is 0.53 for black persons and 0.52 for patients \nwith diabetes. \nC. What is the quality of the screening test? \n1. Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of94-100% and \nspecificity of 98-100% for the detection of AAA, defined \nas an infrarenal aonic diameter > 3.0 cm. \n2. One-time screening is sufficient since cohort studies of \nrepeated scrc:c:ning have shown that ovc:r 10 years, the \nincident rate for neAAAs is 4%, with a feAAA.!; of \n> 4.0 cm found. \n3. Abdominal palpation is not reliable. \nD. Does screening reduce morbidity or mortality? \n1. A meta~analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials of \nscreening for AAA in mc:n showed a reduction in monality \nfrom AAA, with a pooled OR of 0.50 over 13-15 years. \na. Overall in-hospital monality for open AAA repair is \n4.2%; lower mortality is seen in high~volume centers \nperforming> 35 procedures/year (3% mortalityvs 5.5% \n\nin low-volwne centers) and when vascular surgeons \nperform the repair (2.2% for vascular surgeons, 4.0% \nfor cardiac surgeons, 5.5% for general surgeons). \nb. 30-day postoperative mortality is higher with open \nrepair than with endovascular repair (2% absolute \nrisk increase, number needed to harm= 50). There \nare no differences in long-term all-cause mortality or \ncardiovascular monality, or in rates of stroke; therefore, \nendovascular repair is preferred. \n2. There was no reduction in all-cause mortality, or in \nAAA-specific mortality in women. \nE. What are the current guidelines? \n1. USPSTF (2014) \na. Grade B recommendation for one-time screening by \nultrasonography in men age 65-75 who have ever \nsmoked (moderate net benefit) \nb. Grade C recommendation to sdectivdy screen men ages \n65-75 years who have never smoked (small net benefit) \nc. No recommendation (Grade I) for women ages \n65-75 who have ever smoked (insufficient evidence to \ndetermine balance of benefits and harms) \nd. Grade D recommendation to not screen women who \nhave never smoked (harms outweigh benefits) \n2. Society of Vascular Surgery (2009) \na. One-time screening for all men over 65 (at 55 if family \nhistory is positive) \nb. One-time screening for women over 65 who have \nsmoked or have: a positive family history \nCarotid Artery Stenosis (CAS) Screening \nA. What is the burden of disease? \n1. The estimated prevalence of significant CAS (70-99%) in \nthe general population is about 0.5-1 %. \n2. The contribution of significant CAS to morbidity or \nmortality from stroke is not known, nor is the narural \nprogression of asymptomatic CAS. \nB. Is it possible to identify a high-risk group that might especially \nbenefit from screening? \n1. Risk factors for CAS include hypertension, heart disease, \nsmoking, older age, male sex, hypercholesterolemia, and \ndiabetes mdlitus. \n2. There: are no validated, reliable risk assessment tools that \nreliably identify patients with clinically important CAS. \nC. What is the quality of the screening test? \n1. For the detection of> 70% stenosis, carotid duplex \nultrasonography has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity \nof94%. \n2. For the detection of> 50% stenosis, the sensitivity is 98% \nand the specificity is 88%. \n3. There can be wide variation in measurements done in \ndifferent laboratories. \n4. Screening for bruits on physical exam has poor reliability \nand sensitivity. \nD. Does screening reduce morbidity or monality? \n1. There are no studies on the benefits and harms of screening \nfor asymptomatic CAS. \n2. There have: been 3 randomized controlled trials of \ncarotid endarterectomy versus medical therapy for \nSCREENING AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE I 19 \ntreating asymptomatic CAS (Asymptomatic Carotid \nAtherosclerosis Study, Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study, \nand Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial). \na. Pooling the results of all 3 trials demonstrates that \nthe surgical group had a 2% absolute reduction in \nperioperative stroke or death and subsequent ipsilateral \nstroke and a 3.5% reduction in death, perioperativc: \nstroke, or any subsequent stroke. \nb. These: results may not be: generalizable due to the: highly \nselected panicipants and surgeons. \nc. The medical treatment was not well defined or \nstandardized. \nd. These data are from the 1980s and 1990s and do not \nreflect current standard care such as aggressive control \nofBP and lipids. \ne. The Carotid Revascularization and Medical \nManagement for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial \n(CREST-2) in which patients are randomized to carotid \nendanerectomy versus medical therapy, or carotid artery \nstenting versus medical therapy, is underway and will \nprovide more current data. \n3. All abnormal ultrasounds need to be confirmed by digital \nsubtraction angiography, which has a stroke rate of 1 %, or \nby magnetic resonance angiography or CT angiography, \nboth of which are < 100% accurate. \n4. 30-day perioperative stroke or death rates in asymptomatic \npatients range from 2.4% to 3.3%, with rates for women \nat the higher end of the range; in some states, rates are \nover 5%. \n5. The perioperative myocardial infarction rate is 0.8-2.2%. \n6. The 30-day stroke or mortality rate after carotid anery \nstenting is 3.1-3.8% \nE. What are the current guidelines? \n1. USPSTF (2014) \na. Recommends against screening for asymptomatic CAS \nin the general adult population \nb. Grade D recommendation, based on moderate certainty \nthat the benefits of screening do not outweigh the \nharms. \n2. The American Hean Association (2010), the American \nStroke Association (2011), and the Society for Vascular \nSurgery (2011) do not recommend population-based \nscreening. \n3. Other societies, including the American College of \nCardiology and the American College of Radiology do not \nrecommend routine screening, although do recommend \nscreening patients with bruits and to consider screening in \npatients with known atherosclerotic disease. \n\nYou explain t o Mr. S that he should not invest in the \n\"vascular screening.\" Screening for CAS Is not recom-\nmended for t he general population, and since he is younger \nthan 65 years with a minimal history of smoking, he does \nnot need to be screened for AM. \nMr. S has a second list for his wife who is scheduled to \nsee you next: lipid panel, bone mineral density (BMD), Pap \nsmear. and mammogram. \n(continued) \n\n20 I CHAPTER 2 \nMrs.Sis a 42-year-old healthy woman who also has no \nmedical histor:Y. except for 2 normal vaginal deliveries, the \nfirst at age 25.

About 12,900 necases of cervical cancer and 4100 cervical \ncancer-related deaths estimated in the United States \nin 2015 \n2. Incidence rates vary by race/ethnicity: 11.1 per 100,000 \nin Hispanic women; 10 per 100,000 in black women; \n7.4/100,000 in white women; 7.3/100,000 in Asian \nwomen \n3. Rates are considerably higher in countries where cytologic \nscreening is not widdy available; worldwide, cervical cancer \nis the second most common cancer in women and the most \ncommon cause of mortality from gynecologic malignancy. \n4. Women with preinvasive lesions have a 5-year survival of \nnearly 100%, with a 92% 5-year survival for early-stage \ninvasive cancer; only 13% survive distant disease. \nB. Is it possible to identify a high-risk group that might especially \nbenefit from screening? \n1. 93-100% of squamous cell cervical cancers contain DNA \nfrom high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) strains. \na. Low- and high-risk subtypes \nb. Cervix especially vulnerable to infection during \nadolescence when squamous metaplasia is most active. \nc. Most infections cleared by the immune system in \n1-2 years without producing neoplastic changes. \n(1) 90% oflow-risk subtypes resolve over 5 years \n(2) 70% of high-risk subtypes resolve \nd. Women older than 30 years with HPV are more likely \nto have high-grade lesions or cancer than women \nyounger than 30 with HPV. \n2. Early-onset of intercourse (before age 17) and a greater \nnumber oflifetime sexual partners (> 2) are risk factors for \nacquiring HPV. \n3. Cigarette smoking increases risk by 2- to 4-fold. \n4. lmmunocompromise and other sexually transmitted \ninfections, such as herpes and HIY, also increase risk. \n5. In utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol and previous \ntreatment for high-grade lesions are also risk factors for \ncervical cancer. \nC. What is the quality of the screening test? \n1.

Pap smear techniques \na. Conventional Pap smear: cervical cells are spread on a \nglass slide and treated with a fixative by the examiner \nb. Liquid-based cytology: cervical cells are suspended in a vial \nof liquid preservative by the examiner, followed by debris \nremoval and placement onto a slide in the laboratory \n3. HPV testing \na. A cervical specimen is placed into a transport medium \nor into the liquid preservative used for the liquid-based \ncytology Pap smear method. \nb. Specific RNA probes are added that combine with \noncogenic DNA, and the DNA-RNA hybrids are \ndetected by antibodies. \n4. Test characteristics of conventional and liquid-based \ncytology are the same. \na. Sensitivity for high-grade squamous intraepithelial \nlesion is - 56%; for low-grade squamous intraepithelial \nlesion, - 77%. \nb. Specificity for high-grade squamous intraepithelial \nlesion is -97%; for low-grade squamous intraepithelial \nlesion, -80%. \n5. HPV testing is more sensitive but less specific for the \ndetection of CIN 2 and CIN 3; false-positive rates are \nhigher in women under 35 years of age. \nD. Does screening reduce morbidity or mortality? \n1. No randomized trial data demonstrate a reduction in \ncervical cancer mortality with screening. \n2. Many observational smdies shoa decrease in both the \nincidence of cervical cancer {60-90%) and cervical cancer \nmortality (20-60%). \n3. Many cervical cancers in the United States occur in women \nwho have never been screened; madding studies suggest \nthan screening such women would reduce cervical cancer \nmortality by 74%. \n4. Screening intervals are based on a combination of \nrandomized trial data and modeling studies. \nE. What are the current guidelines for women with no history \nof CIN2 or a more severe lesion, no HIY, and no in utero \nexposure to DES? \n\n1. USPSTF (2018) \na. Recommends screening women aged 21-29 with \ncytology (Pap smear) every 3 years; women aged 30--65 \ncan be screened every 3 years with cytology alone \nor every 5 years with HPV testing alone (Grade A \nrecommendation) \nb. Recommends against screening women older than 65 \nwith a history of aMquate \"cmt screening. who are not \notherwise at high risk \n(1) Grade D recommendation \n(2) Adequate screening is defined as 3 consecutive \nnegative cytology results or 2 consecutive negative \nHPV results within 10 years of the cessation of \nscreening, with the most recent test occurring \nwithin 5 years. \nc. Recommends against routine screening in women who \nhave had a total hysterectomy and no history of CIN 2, \nCIN 3, or cervical cancer (Grade D recommendation) \nd. Recommends against screening in women younger than \n21 years (Grade D recommendation) \n2. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n(ACOG) guidelines (2016) are similar to the USPSTF \nguidelines. \na. ACOG recommends cytology every 3 years in women \nages 21-65 or \nb. Cytology every 3 years in women ages 21-29 and cytology \nplus HPV resting (co-resting) in women ages 30-65. \n\nYou explain to Mrs. S that the combination of her sexual \nhistory and her history of 12 normal Pap smears in a ro\nputs her at extremely lorisk for cervical cancer.

What is the burden of disease? \n1. Second leading cause of cancer in women \n2. In average-risk women, the cumulative lifetime risk of \ndevdoping breast cancer is 12%. \n3. The 10-year risk at age 40 is 1.5%; at age 50, it is 2.4%; at \nage 60, it is 3.5%. \n4. In 2015, breast cancer was diagnosed in 232,000 women \nwith 40,000 breast cancer-rdated deaths. \nB. Is it possible to identify a high-risk group that might especially \nbenefit from screening? \n1. Women who have a BRCAJ/BRCA2 mutation are a special \nhigh-risk group, with a relative risk of devdoping breast \ncancer of 10.0-32.0 and a cumulative lifetime risk of \n45-70%. \n2.

Breast density is a risk factor for breast cancer. \na. Density is categorized as fatty (BiRads Density Category \nA), scattered fibroglandular density (Category B), \nheterogeneous density (Category C), or extremdy dense \n(Category D). \nb. The relative risk of breast cancer in women with \nCategory D density, compared to those with Category A \ndensity, is 2.4-4.5. \n6. Age is a strong risk factor. \n7. Other risk factors are listed in Table 2-7. \n8. Protective factors include > 16 months of breastfeeding, \n5 or more pregnancies, exercise, postmenopausal \nBMI < 23 kg/m2, oophorectomy before age 35. \n9.

Whether she should \nbe screened prior to age 50 depends on her personal risk \ntolerance. \n~ \nShould Mr9. 5 be 9C:reened for 09teoporo9ls1 \nOsteoporosis Screening \nA. What is the burden of disease? \n1. In the United States, about 10.3 million people over the \nage of50 have osteoporosis (15.4% of women and 4.3% \nof men}. \n2. The prevalence of osteoporosis is 25% in women aged 65 \nor older and 5.6% in men aged 65 or older. \n3. More than 2 million fractures per year are related to \nosteoporosis, including about 300,000 hip fractures and \n700,000 vertebral &actures. \n4. Mortality rate in the first year after hip &acture is 20%. \nB. Is it possible to identify a high-risk group that might especially \nbenefit from screening? \n1. LoBMD itself is the strongest risk factor for &acture. \n2. Increasing age is the strongest risk fu:tor for loBMD; \nother risk factors include lobody weight(< 132 pounds}, \nlack of hormone replacement therapy use, family history \nof osteoporosis, personal history of fracture, ethnic group \n(white, Asian, Hispanic), current smoking, 3 or more \nalcoholic drinks/day, long-term corticosteroid use (<!: 5 mg \nof prednisone daily for <!: 3 months). \n3. The WHO Fracture Risk Algorithm (FRAX) calculates the \n10-year probability of hip or major osteoporotic fracture \nusing femoral neck BMD and clinical risk factors (available \nat http://www.sheac.uk/FRAX/). \na. Although the full FRAX algorithm incorporates femoral \nneck BMD, it is possible to input just clinical risk \nfu:tors to estimate the patient's clinical risk. \nb. Using just clinical risk factors, a 65-year-old woman \nwith no additional positive answers has a 9.3% 10-year \nrisk for any osteoporotic fracture. \n4. The Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OSn is designed \nto identify individuals more likely to have loBMD. \na. OST score = [weight (kg) - age (years}] x 0.2 \nb. Patients with a score of< 2 are considered high risk. \nS. For identifying osteoporosis (T score S -2.5), the FRAX \nhas a sensitivity of 33.3% and speciflcity of 86.4% \n(LR+, 2.4; LR-, 0.77}; the OST has a sensitivity of79.3% \nand a specificity of70.1%(LR+,2.6; LR-, 0.29). \nC. What is the quality of the screening test? \n1. Background \na. Can measure bone density with a variety of methods \n(dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, single-energy x-ray \nabsorptiometry, ultrasonography, quantitative en at a \nvariety of sites (hip, lumbar spine, heel, forearm) \nb. Current bone density is compared with peak predicated \nbone density and then reported as number of SD above \nor belopeak predicted bone density. \nc. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density \"T score\" \nat least 2.5 SD belopeak predicted bone density \n(T score = -2.5 or more negative). \nd. Osteopenia is defined as a T score between-LO and-2.5. \ne. Normal is within 1 SD of peak predicted bone density. \n2. Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry is the gold standard \ntest. \na. Has been shown to be a strong predictor of hip fracture \nrisk; femoral neck is best site to measure. \nb. The relative risk of hip fracture is 2.5 for each decrease \nof 1 SD in bone density at the femoral neck. \nc. The relative risk of vertebral fracture is 1.9 for each \ndecrease of 1 SD in bone density at the femoral neck. \n3. There are limited data regarding the optimal interval \nbetween screening exams. \na. One study found that a repeat hone density 8 years after \nthe initial test did not improve fracture risk prediction \nwhen compared with the initial test. \nb. Another study stratifled patients by baseline bone \ndensity and then determined the estimated time \ninterval for 10% of women in each cohort to develop \nosteoporosis or an osteoporotic fracture. \n(1) For women with a normal BMD (T score, -1.0 or \nhigher), the interval was 16 years. \n(2) For women with mild osteopenia (T score, -1.01 to \n-1.49), the interval was 17 years. \n(3) For women with moderate osteopenia (T score, \n-1.50 to -1.99), the interval was 5 years; for those \nwith advanced osteopenia (T score, -2.0 to -2.49), \nthe interval was 1 year. \nD. Does screening reduce morbidity or mortality? \n1. No studies of the effectiveness of screening in reducing \nosteoporotic &actures \n2. Many studies shotreatment substantially reduces fracture \nrisk. \n3. Potential harms of screening include misinterpretation of \ntest results, increasing anxiety in patients, side effects of \nmedications, and cost. \n4, If 10,000 women aged 65-69 are screened, assuming a \n12% prevalence of osteoporosis and that treatment reduces \nvertebral fracture by 50% and hip fracture by 66% \na. The number needed to screen to prevent 1 vertebral \nfracture over 5 years is 233 and to prevent 1 hip &acture \nis 556. \nb. In women aged 60-64 (osteoporosis prevalence 6.5%), \nthe number needed to screen for vertebral fracture is \n435 and for hip fracture is 1 OOO. \nc. In women aged 75-79 (osteoporosis prevalence 28%), \nthe number needed to screen for vertebral fracture is 96 \nand for hip fracture is 238. \nE. What are the current guidelines? \n1. USPSTF (2018) \na. Screen for osteoporosis in women aged 65 years or older \nand in younger postmenopausal women at increased \nrisk(> 9.3% 10-year risk based on the FRAX calculator \nwithout BMD measurement or high risk based on \nanother tool such as the OST). \n\nSCREENING AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE I 25 \nTable 2-1 o.

Diagnoses range from benign entities \n(eg, irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]) to life-threatening diseases \n(eg, ruptured abdominal aonic aneurysms [AAAs]). The first \npivotal step in diagnosing abdominal pain is to identify the \nlocation of the pain. The differential diagnosis can then be limited \nto a subset of conditions that cause pain in that panicular quadrant \nof the abdomen (Figure 3-1}. \nSeveral other pivotal points can help narrothe differential \ndiagnosis including (1) the time course of the pain, (2) peritoneal \nfindings on exam, (3) unexplained hypotension, and (4) abdomi-\nnal distention. Each of these is reviewed below. \nThe time course of the pain is a pivotal feature. Some diseases \npresent subacutely/chronically over weeks to months or years \n(eg, IBS} whereas others present acutely, within hours to days of \nonset (eg, appendicitis). In patients with their first episode of acute \nsevere abdominal pain, a variety of life-threatening, must not miss \ndiagnoses must be considered {eg, AAA). Many of these diseases \nthat cause acute abdominal pain cannot recur because patients are \neither treated or die of complications (eg, AAA, acute appendicitis, \nsplenic rupture.) Since prior episodes are incompatible with many \nof these diagnoses, a history of such prior episodes narrows the dif-\nferential diagnosis. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of abdomi-\nnal pain can be organized based on whether patients are presenting \nwith their (1) first episode of acute abdominal pain, (2) a recurrent \nepisode of acute abdominal pain, or (3) chronidsubacute abdom-\ninal pain. Table 3-1 outlines the typical time course associated \nwith different diseases causing abdominal pain. See Table 3-2 for \na summary of abdominal pain organized by location, time course, \nand clinical clues. \nPeritoneal findings of rebound tenderness, rigidity, and guard-\ning are pivotal features and suggest an intra-abdominal catastro-\nphe. Typical causes include AAA, bowel infarction (due to bowel \nobstruction or acute mesenteric ischemia}, bowel perforation \n(due to appendicitis, peptic ulcer disease [PUD], diveniculitis), \npancreatitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). \nUnexplained hypotension is yet another potential pivotal clue. \nWhile many patients with abdominal pain experience hypotension \ndue to dehydration from nausea, vomiting, or poor oral intake, \nsome patients with abdominal pain present with unexplained \nhypotension. Unexplained hypotension can suggest sepsis, retro-\nperitoneal hemorrhage, or other diseases. Table 3-3 lists diseases \nassociated with abdominal pain and unexplained hypotension. \nOnhostatic vital signs should be taken in \npatients with abdominal pain. They may \nprovide invaluable diagnostic and therapeutic \ninformation. \nThe final pivotal finding is significant abdominal distentlon, \nwhich may develop from excess air or fluid in the abdomen. \nExcess air may occur with bowel obstruction or bowel perforation \n(free air). Excess fluid may be seen in patients with ascites or hem-\norrhage. Percussion and shifting dullness can usually distinguish \nexcess air from fluid in such patients. Table 3-4 lists the diagnostic \nconsiderations in patients with abdominal distention. \nOther irnponant historical points include factors that make the \npain better or worse (eg, eating), its' quality, radiation of the pain, \nand associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, anorexia, inability to \npass stool and flatus, melena, hematochezia, change in color of the \nurine or stool, jaundice, fever, chills, weight loss, altered bowel hab-\nits, orthostatic symptoms, urinary symptoms) or prior abdominal \nsurgeries (increasing the risk of small bowel obstruction [SBO]}. \nPulmonary symptoms or a cardiac history can be clues to pneu-\nmonia or myocardial infarction presenting as abdominal pain. In \nwomen, sexual and menstrual histories are imponant. The patient \nshould be asked about alcohol consumption as well as prescription \nand over-the-counter medications and supplements. \nA fefinal points about the physical exam are wonh empha-\nsizing. First, vital signs are just that, vital. Hypotension, fever, tach-\nypnea, and tachycardia are critical clinical clues that must not be \noverlooked. The HEENT exam should look for pallor or icterus. \nJaundice suggests either hepatitis or biliary disease. Careful heart \nand lung exams can suggest pneumonia or other extra-abdominal \ncauses of abdominal pain. \nThe physical exam of a patient with abdominal \npain includes more than just the abdominal \nexam. \nOf course, the abdominal exam is key. Inspection assesses \nfur distention as noted above. Auscultation evaluates whether \nbowel sounds are present. Absent bowel sounds may suggest an \nintra-abdominal catastrophe; high-pitched tinkling sounds and \nrushes suggest an intestinal obstruction. Palpation should be \nperformed last. It is usefUI to distract the patient by continuing to \ntalk with him or her during abdominal palpation.

The clinician should palpate the painful area \nlast. The rectal exam should be performed, and the stool tested for \noccult blood. Finally, the pelvic exam should be performed in adult \nwomen and the testicular exam in men. \n\nMr. C felt well until the onset of pain several hours ago. He \nreports that the pain is a pressure-like sensation in the mid/ \nupper abdomen. which Is not partlcula rly severe. He had never \nhad this symptom before.

Given this \ndifferential diagnosie, what teste should 1:1e \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe patient's history is not particularly suggestive of any diagno-\nsis. The first pivotal point determines the location of the pain. \nMr. C's pain is in the mid/upper abdomen, which limits the dif-\nferential diagnosis. Common causes of mid/upper abdominal pain \ninclude appendicitis, IBS, PUD, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel \ndisease (IBD), SBO, large bowel obstruction, acute ischemia, AAA, \nmyocardial infarction, diabetic ketoacidosis, and gastroenteritis \n(Figure 3-1). Several of these diagnoses are very unlikely and need \nnot be considered further. AAA and myocardial infarction would \nbe exceptionally rare in this age group and gastroenteritis is very \nunlikely in the absence of either vomiting or diarrhea. Acute ische-\nmia is unlikely given the absence of pain out of proportion to exam. \nThe lack of a history of diabetes would make diabetic ketoacido-\nsis unlikely unless this was the initial presentation. A simple blood \nsugar could help exclude this diagnosis. Other pivotal points in \npatients with abdominal pain include its time course (see Table 3-1), \nand if present, unexplained hypotension or abdominal distention \n(see Tables 3-3 and 3-4). The patient reports that this is an acute \nepisode that has not occurred previously. This makes IBD and IBS \nvery unlikely, focusing attention on the remaining possibilities of \nappendicitis, PUD, pancreatitis, and bowel obstruction. Appendi-\ncitis is the leading hypothesis as it is common and amenable to sur-\ngical cure (Table 3-5). He has neither unexplained hypotension nor \ndistention to hdp focus the differential diagnosis further. \nTable 3-5.

If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Appendicitis \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation of appendicitis is abdominal pain that is \ninitially diffuse and then intensifies and migrates toward the right \nlower quadrant (RLQ) to McBurney point (1.5-2 inches from \nthe anterior superior iliac crest toward umbilicus). Patients often \ncomplain of bloating and anorexia. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of an acute \nabdomen, with a 7% lifetime occurrence rate. \nB. It devdops secondary to obstruction of the appendiceal orifice \nwith secondary mucus accumulation, swelling, ischemia, \nnecrosis, and perforation. \nC. Initially, the pain is poorly localized. However, progressive \ninflammation eventually involves the parietal peritoneum, \nresulting in pain localized to the RLQ. \nD. The risk of perforation increases steadily with age. \n1. Ages 10-40, 10% \n2. Age 60, 30% \n3. Age > 75, 50% \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The classic presentation of nausea and vomiting with pain \nmigration from the periumbilical area to the RLQ is present in \nonly 50-65% of patients. \nTable 3-6. Classic clinical and laboratory findings in appendicitis. \nABDOMINAL PAIN I 31 \nB. RLQpain is the most useful clinical finding; LR+, 7.3-8.5; \nLR-, 0.0-0.3 \nC. Most of the clinical findings have losensitivity for \nappendicitis making it difficult to rule out the diagnosis. \n1. In one study, guarding was completdy absent in 22% of \npatients, and rebound was completdy absent in 16% of \npatients with appendicitis. \n2. Fever was present in only 40% of patients with perforated \nappendices. \n~ \nFever, severe tenderness, guarding, and rebound \ny \nmay be absent in patients with appendicitis. \nD. Nonetheless, certain findings increase the likdihood of \nappendicitis when present {ie, rebound, guarding) {Table 3-6). \nE. Symptoms are different in octogenarians than in patients aged \n60-79 years. \n1. Symptom duration is longer (48 vs 24 hours). \n2. They are less likely to repon that pain migrated to the RLQ \n(29% vs 49%). \nF. History is particularly important in women to differentiate \nother causes of RLQ pain ( eg, PID, ruptured ectopic \npregnancy, ovarian torsion, and ruptured ovarian cyst). \nThe most useful clinical clues that suggest PID include the \nfollowing: \n1. History of PID \n2. Vaginal discharge \n3. Cervical motion tenderness on pelvic exam \nRule out ectopic pregnancy in premenopausal \nwomen who complain of abdominal pain by \ntesting urine for beta-HCG. \nG.

An additional 30% of patients in the observation \ngtoup needed surgery within the year for \nrecurrences. \nF. Surgery remains the therapy of choice. \n\nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. C's symptoms are consistent with-but certainly not diagnos-\ntic of-appendicitis. He has no risk factors for any of the alterna-\ntive diagnoses of pancreatitis, PUD, or bowel obstruction {alcohol \nuse, NSAID ingestion, or prior abdominal surgery, respectively). \nDiagnostic options include obtaining a complete blood count \n(CBC) (always done but clearly oflimited value), continued obser-\nvation and reexamination, surgical consultation, and obtaining a \nCT scan. Given the lack of evidence for any of the less concerning \npossibilities, you remain concerned that the patient has early appen-\ndicitis. You elect to observe the patient, obtain a CBC and lipase, \norder a CT scan and ask for a surgical consult. \n\nFrequent clinical observations are exceptionally \nuseful when evaluating a patient with possible \nappendicitis. \nThe CBC reveals a WOC of 8700/mcl (86% neutrophils, \n0% bands) and an HCT of44%. The lipase is normal. On reex-\namlnatlon the patient complains that the pain Is nomore \nsevere Jn the RLQ. On exam, he Is moderately tender but still \nwithout rebound or guardll'J{l. \nThe migration of pain to the RLQ is suggestive of appendicitis. \nLess likely considerations might include Crohn ileitis as wdl as \ndiverticulitis or colon cancer {both unlikely in this age group). If \nthe patient were a woman, PID and ovarian pathology (ruptured \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMs. R Is a 50-year-old woman who comes to the office com-\nplaining of abdominal pain. The patient reports that she has \nbeen having \"episodes\" or \"attacks\" of abdominal pain over \nthe last month, with about 3 \"attacks\" during this time. The \nlast attack was 4 days priMously. She reports that the \nattacks of pain are In the eplgastrlum, last up to 4 hours, \nand often awaken her at night. The pain Is described as a \nsevere cramping-like sensation that is very intense and \nsteady for hours. Occasionally, the pain radiates to the \nright back. The pain is associated with emesis. She reports \nthat the color of her urine and stool are normal. On physical \nexam, her vital signs are stable. She Is afebrile. On HEENT \nexam, she Is anlcterlc. Her lungs are clear, and cardiac \nexam is unremarkable. Abdominal exam is so~ with only \nmild epigastric discomfort to deep palpation. Murphy sign \n(tenderness In the right upper quadrant [RUQ] with pal-\npation during Inspiration) Is negative. Rectal exam reveals \ngualac-negatlve stool. \n~ \nAt this point, what le the leading hypothesis, \n,~,.. what are the active altematlvee, and le \nthere a must not mll!ll!I diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests &hould be \nordered? \nABDOMINAL PAIN I 33 \nectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, or ruptured ovarian cyst) would \nalso need to be considered. \n\nDiffuse abdominal pain that subsequently \nlocalizes and becomes more constant, suggests \nparietal peritoneal inflammation. \nTheCT 5ean reveals a hypodensefluld collection on the right \nside inferior to t he cecum. An appendolith is seen. The Inter-\npretation is possible appendiceal perforat ion versus Crohn \ndisease. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nThe patient 's symptom complex, particularly the pain's \nmigration, localization, and intensification are highly sug-\ngestive of appendicitis. CT findings make this diagnosis \nllkely. At t his point, surgical exploration Is appropriate. \nThe patient undergoes surgery and purulent material \nIs found In the peritoneal cavity. A necrotic appendix Is \nremoved, and t he perftoneal cavit y ls Irrigated. The patient \nis treated with broad-spectrum ant ibiotics and does well \npostoperatively. \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe first pivotal reature of Ms. R's abdominal pain is its epigastric \nlocation. Common causes of epigastric pain include PUD, pancreati-\ntis, and biliary colic (Figure 3-1). The second pivotal feature of Ms. R's \nabdominal pain is its time course, with multiple acute episodes. Many \ndiseases cause well-defined recurrent discrete episodes of abdominal \npain (Table 3-1) but of these, only pancreatitis and biliary colic tend \nto occur in the epigastriurn. PUD is a common cause of epigastric \nabdominal pain and obviously needs to be considered. However, the \npain in PUD is typically more chronic than acute, and not typically \ndiscrete or so severe, making this a less likely possibility. Ms. R does \nnot have other pivotal clues such as peritoneal findings, unexplained \nhypotension, or abdominal distention that could focus the differential. \nThe final clinical due is the severe crampy quality of the pain. Severe \nintense crampy abdominal pain (\"colicky\") suggests obstruction of \na holloviscera, which can be caused by biliary, bowel, or ureteral \nobstruction (due to biliary stones, bowel obstruction, or nephrolithia-\nsis, respectively). Taken together, the epigastric location, multiple dis-\ncrete episodes, quality and intensity of the pain, make biliary colic the \nleading hypothesis. Table 3-8 lists the diffCrential diagnosis. \n\nMs. R reports no history of alcohol i:Jlnglng. NSAID use, or \nknown PUD. The pain does not improve with food or antacids. \nThe pain is not relieved by defecation. \n(continued) \n\n34 I CHAPTER 3 \n(9 ths clinical lnfomuatlon 9ufftclsnt to maks a \ndlqnoelef If not, what othsl\" lnfol'lflatlon do \nyoune8d1 \nLeading Hypothesis: Biliary Colic \nTa:tbook Praentation \nGallstone disc:asc: may preaent as incidentally discovc:rc:d asymp-\ntomatic cholditbiasis, biliary colic, cholecystitis, cholangitis, or \npancrcatitis. The pattern depends on the location of the stone and \nits chronicity (Figure 3-2). Biliary colic typically presents with \nepisodes of intense abdominal pain that begin 1 hour or more after \neating and commonly wake patients from sleep.

The pain usually lasts for more than 30 minutes \nand may last for hours. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Biliary colic \n1. Gallstones arc commonly asymptomati&. Biliary colic occurs \nwhen a gallstone becomes lodged in the cystic duct and the \ngallbladder contracts against the obstruction. \n2. Annual risk of biliary colic in patients with asymptomatic \ngallstones is 1-4%. \n3. Risk factors for gallstone dcvdopment \na. Increasing age is the predominant risk factor. The \nprevalence is 8% in patients older than 40 years and \n20% in those older than 60 years (Figure 3-3). \nb. Obesity \nc. Sex: women are affected more than men (risk increases \ndwing pregnancy), although the incidence in men is \nstill signiAcant (Figure 3-3). \ncl. Gallbladder stasis (due to rapid weight loss, which may \noccur in patients on very low-calorie diets, on total \nparenteral nutrition, and after surgery) \nc. Other less common risk factors include f.unily history, \nCrohn disease. and hemolytic anemias (eg. thalassemia, \nsiclde cell disease), which can lead to increased bilirubin \nacretion and billrubin stonea. \n4. Presents as one of the classic visceral obstructive syndromes \nwith severe, crampy waves of pain that incapacitate the \npatient. \n5.

The pain usually lasts < 2-4 hours. An episode that \nlasts longer than 4--6 hours and is accompanied by fever \nor marked RUQ tenderness suggests cholecystitis has \ndevdoped. \n9. Resolution occurs if the stone comes out of the cystic duct. \nThe intense pain improves fairly rapidly, although mild \ndiscomfort may persist for 1-2 days. \n10. Prognosis \na. Biliary colic recurs in 50% of symptomatic patients. \nb. Acute cholecystitis develops if the stone remains lodged \nin the cystic duct. \nc. Complications {eg, pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, or \nascending cholangitis) occur in 25% of patients who \nhave experienced biliary colic. \n11. Colic occasionally develops in patients without stones \nsecondary to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or scarring \nleading to obstruction. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Pain localized to the RUQ in 54% of patients and epigastrium \nin 34% of patients. It also may present as a band-like \npain across the entire upper abdomen, or rardy in the \nmid-abdomen. Pain may radiate to back, right scapula, \nright flank, or chest. \nB. Laboratory tests (liver biochemical tests, lipase, urinalysis) are \nnormal in uncomplicated biliary colic.

You order an ultrasound of \ntheRUQ. \n\nA RUQ ultrasound reveals multiple small gallstones within \nthe gallbladder. The CBD Is normal. and no other abnormali-\nties are seen. The serum lipase and liver blochemlcal tests are \nnormal, and atool antigen for HelicofJacterpylorl ls negative. \nHave you croeead a dlagn09tlc; thre!lhold for \nthe leading hypothesis, 11fllary cone? Have \nyou ruled out the active alternative&? Do \nother ta&ts need to 11e dona to eJCClude the \naltematlve diagnoses? \nAlternative Diagnosis: PUD \nSee Chapter 32, Unintentional Weight Loss. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Acute Pancreatitis \n(see below) \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMs. R discussed her case with her primary care physician \nand surgeon. Both agree that her symptom complex and \nultrasound suggest biliary colic. Furthermore, t here was \nno evidence of any ofthe alternative diagnoses. The normal \nlipase effectively rules out pancreatitis, and the combi-\nnation of no NSAIDs and a negative H pYlorl stool antigen \nmakes PUD very unlikely. They recommend surgery, which \nshe schedules for the end of the summer. \nFOLLOW-UP \n\nMs. R retums 3 weeks later (and prior to her scheduled \nsurgery) in acute distress. She reports that her pain began \nlast evening. Is In t he same location as her previous bouts \nof pain, but unlike her previous episodes, the pain has per-\nsisted. She Is very uncomfortable. She reports t hat her \nurine has changed color and is noquite dark, \"like tea.\" \nIn addition, she complains of \"teeth chattering\" chills. On \nphysical exam, Ms. R is febrile (38.5C). Her other vital signs \nare stable. Sciera are anlcterlc and cardiac and pulmonary \n(continued) \n\n36 I CHAPTER 3 \nexams are all completely normal. Abdominal exam reveals \nmoderate tendemess in the epigastrium and RUQ. Murphy \nsign Is positive. \nAt thle point, what le the leading hypotheele, \nwhat are the active alternatlws, and Is \nthere a mu9t not miH dfagnoele1 Given thl9 \ndifferential dlagnoele, what teete should l1e \nordsred1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThis episode of abdominal pain raises several possibilities. The first \nis that the current symptom complex is in some way related to her \nknown cholelithiasis. The persistent pain suggests either cholecys-\ntitis (due to a stone lodged in the cystic duct), choledocholithiasis, \nascending cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Of note, her dark urine is a \npivotal clinical clue. Both hematuria and bilirubinuria can cause \ndark urine. Bilirubinuria only occurs in patients with conjugated \nhyperbilirubinemia which, in turn, is due to either CBD obstruction \nor hepatitis. In Ms. R, the preexistent billary colic, persistent RUQ \npain, and dark urine make the most likely diagnosis CBD obstruc-\ntion due to migration of a stone into the CBD (choledocholithiasis) \n(Figure 3-2). Conversely, this symptom complex is not consistent \nwith cholecystitis. In uncomplicated cholecystitis, only the cystic \nduct is obstructed. Since the CBD is not obstructed, bile flows \nunimpeded into the bowel, and does not back up into the liver. \nTherefore, such patients do not develop hyperbilirubinemia, biliru-\nbinuria, dark urine, or significant increases in ALT or AST. Finally, \nMs. R's fever suggests that the CBD obstruction has been compli-\ncated by ascending infection and taken together suggests ascending \ncholangitis, a life-threatening condition. \nDark urine suggests bilirubinuria and may \nprecede icterus. \nRigors (defined as visible shaking or teeth \nchattering chills) suggests bacteremia \nand should increase the suspicion of a \nlife-threatening bacterial infection. \nOther considerations include hepatitis or pancreatitis (which may \nbe caused by concomitant pancreatic duct obstruction). While hep-\natitis can cause RUQpain, hyperbilirubinemia, and bilirubinuria, it \nwould also require giving Ms. R another unrelated diagnosis and is \ntherefore less likely. Table 3-9 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nLaboratory results include WBC 17,000/mcL (84% neu-\ntrophlls, 10% bands). HCT Is 38%; llpase, 17 units/L \n(nl 11-65 unlts/L); alkaline phosphatase, 467 unlts/L \n(nl 30-120); bilirul7in, 4.2 mg/dL; conjugated bilirubin, \n3.0 mg/dl (nl 0 - 0.3); GGT. 246 unlts/L (nl 8-35); ALT, \n100 unlts/L (nl 15-59).

The presence of \njaundice, increased liver biochemical tests or lipase suggest con-\ncomitant CBD obstruction. When accompanied by fever, it also \nsuggests ascending cholangitis. \nDisease Highlights \nA. 5-20% of patients with symptomatic gallstones have stones \nwithin the CBD (choledocholithiasis). \nB. Patients with choledocholithiasis may be asymptomatic. \nC. Complications of choledocholithiasis may be the presenting \nmanifestations. \nI. Obstruction and jaundice may be present. \n2. Fever, jaundice, and leukocytosis may be present due \nto ascending infection from the duodenum {ascending \ncholangitis). Ascending cholangitis may also occur when \nthe CBD is obstructed due to tumors or strictures. \n3. Pancreatitis may occur if there is concomitant obstruction \nof the pancreatic duct. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Ascending cholangitis \nI. Clinical findings in patients with cholangitis include \njaundice, 79%; temperature ~ 38.0C, 77%; and RUQ \npain, 68%. In various studies 42-75% of patients had all \n3 (Charcot triad). \n\n2. There is leukocytosis in 73% of patients and elevated \nalkaline phosphatase and bilirubin in 91%and87%, \nrespectively. \n3. 74% of patients are bacteremic \nBacteremia is exceptionally common in \nascending cholangitis. Antibiotics should be \nadministered promptly to patients in whom \nthis diagnosis is suspected. \nB. Choledocholithiasis \n1. Any of the following suggests choledocholithiasis and \nwarrants CBD evaluation (Table 3-10): \na. Cholangitis \nb. Jaundice \nc. Dilated CBD on ultrasound \nd. Elevated alkaline phosphatase \ne. Elevated amylase or lipase \n2. CBD stones are present in 5-8% of patients without any of \nthe aforementioned risk factors. \n3. Transabdominal ultrasound is insmsitivt for \ncholedochollthiasis as opposed to its excellent performance \nin cholelithiasis. A dilated CBD is seen in only 25% of \npatients. \n4. CT scanning is only 75% sensitive for choledocholithiasis \nand not the test of choice. \n5. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), \nmagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), \nand EUS are highly accurate in detecting CBD stones. \nThese techniques share high sensitivity (90-100%) and \nspeciAcity (90-100%). \na.

Reserving ERCP for the subset \nof patients with docummttd choledocholithiasis \ndecreases the need for ERCP by 67% and the \ncomplication rate by 12%, compared with \nperforming ERCP in all patients with suspected \ncholedocholithiasis. \nd. Summary: The American Society of Gastrointestinal \nEndoscopy recommends the following based on the risk \nof choledocholithiasis: \n(1) High-risk patients (> 50% risk): ERCP is \nrecommended in patients with \n(a) Clinical ascending cholangitis \n(b) Documented CBD stones \n(c) Billrubin > 4 mg/dL \n(cl) Bilirubin levds of 1.8--4 mg/ dL and dilated CBDs \n(2) Moderate-risk patients (10-50% risk): MRCP or \nEUS is recommended followed by selective ERCP \nin patients with docummttd choledocholithiasis. \n(a) Patients with dilated CBD on ultrasound \n(b) Elevated bilirubin levels (1.8-4 mg/dl..) \n(c) Gallstone-associated pancreatitis (GAP) \n(d) Elevated liver biochemical tests \n(e) Age > 55 years \n(f) An alternative approach is laparoscopic \ncholecystectomy with intraoperative \ncholangiogram and postoperative ERCP in \npatients with choledocholithiasis. \n(3) Low-risk patients (< 10% risk): In patients with \ngallstone disease and none of the aforementioned \nrisk factors, laparoscopic cholecystectomy without \nother preoperative CBD evaluation is recommended. \nTreatment \nA. .Ascending cholangitis \n1. Blood cultures, IV broad-spectrum antibiotics, and \nIV hydration should begin immediately. \n2. Biliary drainage with ERCP should be performed urgently \nin patients with moderate to severe disease. (Organ \ndysfunction or 2 or more of the following: abnormal WBC, \nfever, age> 75 years, total bilirubin > 5 mg/dL, albumin \n< 0.7 times the lower limit of normal.) \n3. In patients with mild disease, biliary drainage should be \nperformed if there is no response to initial treatment within \n24 hours. \n4. If ERCP is unavailable, percutaneous transhepatic drainage \nor surgical decompression can be used. \n\n38 I CHAPTER 3 \nB. In patients who have choledocholithiasis without asc:ending \ncholangitis, CBD stones c:an be removed via intraoperative \nCBD exploration or ERCP. \nC. Cholecystec:tomy is rec:ommended after inflammation has \nresolved in patients with asc:ending c:holangitis. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nNeither dilation of the CBD nor CBD stone c:an be seen on \nultrasound (but is only 25% sensitive). You still suspec:t c:hole-\ndoc:holithiasis bec:ause of the jaundic:e and increased transaminases. \nTwenty-four hours later, blood cultures are positive for \nEscherichia coli (consistent with ascend i~ chola~ itis ). \nHava you croesed a diagnostic threehold \nfor th8 l8adlng hypoth8ele, aecsnding \ncholangltls7 Have you rul&I out the active \naltematlvee1 Do other teete ne8d to be done \nto e><clude the altematlve dlagnosee7 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis \nSee Chapter 26, Jaundice & Abnormal Llver Enzymes. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Acute Cholecystitis \nTextbook Presentation \nTypic:al symptoms of ac:ute c:holecystitis include persistent RUQ or \nepigastric pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. \nDiseue Higblighu \nA.

Leukoc:ytosis (> 10,000/mc:L} is present in 52-63% of \npatients. \n2. Cholecystitis does not typic:ally c:ause significant increases \nin lipase or liver biochemic:al tests. Such findings suggest \nc:omplic:ations of panc:reatitis and c:holedocholithiasis. \nC. Ultrasound \n1.

Choldithiasis is usually present {84-99%) but is not in and \nof itself diagnostic of acute cholec:ystitis. \n4. Additional flndings that suggest acute c:holecystitis include \ngallstones with gallbladder wall thickening, peric:holecystic \nfluid, sonographic Murphy sign, or gallbladder enlargement \n> 5 c:m. However, more specific flndings may be less \nsensitive (27-38%). \n5. If ultrasound is normal, and clinical suspicion is high, \nc:onsider HIDA {see bdow). \nD. Bedside ultrasound by trained nonradiologists \n1. Used with increasing frequency in emergency departments \n2. One study reported good accuracy when performed by \nemergency department physicians with 5 hours of training; \nsensitivity, 91%; specificity, 66%; LR+, 2.7; LR-, 0.14. \n3. Abnormal results should be conflrmed with formal \nultrasonography. \n4, Normal results are probably adequate to rule out \nc:holecystitis in patients with lopretest probabilities but \nnot in those for whom there is a higher suspicion of acute \ncholecystitis. \nE. Cholescintigraphy (HIDA) sc:ans \n1. Radioisotope is excreted by the liver into the biliary system. \nIn normal patients, the gallbladder conc:entrates the isotope \nand is visualized. Visualization essentially excludes acute \ncholecystitis. \n2. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder suggests cystic duc:t \nobstruction and is highly specific for acute cholecystitis \n(96% sensitive, 90% specific). \n3. Nonvisualization can also be seen in prolonged fasting, \nhepatitis, alcohol abuse, and prior biliary sphincterotomy. \n4. Useful when the pretest probability is high, due to \npersistent pain, and the ultrasound is nondiagnostic \n(ie, the ultrasound demonstrates stones within the \ngallbladder but no clear evidence of cholec:ystitis is seen, \neg, no stones within the cystic duct nor evidenc:e of \ngallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid). \nF. A diagnostic algorithm to the approach of suspected gallstone \ndisease is shown in Figure 3-4. \nTreatment \nPatients with acute cholecystitis should be admitted, administered \nparenteral antibiotics, and undergo c:holecystectomy. The timing \nof surgery depends on the severity of disease and medical risk \nassessment. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Acute Pancreatitis \nTatbook Presentation \nPatients with acute pancreatitis often complain of a constant and \nboring abdominal pain of moderate to severe intensity that devel-\nops in the epigastrium and may radiate to the back. Associated \nsymptoms may include nausea, vomiting, low~grade fever, and \nabdominal distentlon. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Etiology \n1.

Several predictive scores have been developed including \nthe Ranson criteria as well as the Glasgoand Apache II \nscores. \n(1) All use similar variables that increase the \nlikelihood of organ failure, including increased \nage and elevated WBC, BUN, glucose, or lactate \ndehydrogenase. \n(2) Hypoxia and hypoc:alc:emia are also associated with \nan increased risk. \nc.

Studies suggest that significant elevations of the \nbilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, or AST in patients \nwith panc:reatitis suggest etiology secondary to gallstones \n(GAP). These enzymes increase due to concomitant \nobstruction of the CBD. \n(1) ALT or AST elevations > 100 international units/L \nsuggest GAP (sensitivity\"' 55%, specificity\"' 93%; \nLR+ 8-9) \n(2) AST levels < 50 international units/L make GAP \nunlikely (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 68%; LR-, 0.15). \n(3) 10% of patients with GAP have normal levels of \nalkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, AST, and ALT. \nb. Patients with GAP have a high risk of recurrent \npancreatitls and require cholec:ystec:romy. \n4. Imaging: A variety of imaging techniques c:an be used in \npatients with acute panc:reatitis. \na.

The pain Is perlumblllcal with \nsevere crampy exacerbations that last for several min-\nutes and then subside. He note5 loud intestinal noises \n(borborygmi) during the periods of increased pain. The pain \nis associated with nausea and vomiting. He denies d iarrhea. \nHe reports decreased appetite with no oral Intake In the \nla5t 48 hours. He denies having this pain previously. \n~~ At this point, what le the leadl11<:1 hypothe5l5, \n1 ~JI\"' what are the active altematlves, and Is \nthere a muet not mlse diagnosis? Given thle \ndifferential diagnoeie, what teete should 17e \nordsred? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe first pivotal point for Mr. J's abdominal pain is its periumbilical \nlocation. A variety of diseases present with pain in this location, \nincluding AAA, appendicitis (early), bowel ischemia, bowel \nobstruction, diabetic k.etoacidosis, gastroenteritis, IBS, and IBD \n(Figure 3-1). The second useful pivotal point to consider is the time \ncourse of Mr. J's abdominal pain (Table 3-1). This allows us to fur-\nther limit the differential diagnosis to those diseases causing acute \nperiumbilical pain. Typically, IBS and IBD do not cause acute pain. \nFurthermore, diabetic ketoacidosis is unlikely (unless this is his \npresentation of diabetes). Gastroenteritis is also unlikely given the \nabsence of diarrhea and the severity of the pain. Finally, Mr. J's severe \ncrampy abdominal pain suggests some type of visceral obstruction. \nThe syndromes associated with pain of this quality include ure-\nteral obstruction secondary to kidney stones, biliary obstruction, \n3. CBD evaluation (with intraoperative cholangiogram, \nMRCP, or EUS) is also required to ensure that the CBD is \nclear of stones. \nJ. Alcoholabstinence \nK. Nutrition \nI. Enteral feeding is superior to parenteral feeding and has \nbeen shown to decrease mortality. \n2. Enteral feeding avoids a variety of N catheter-related \ncomplications and decreases gut bacterial translocation, \nwhich may contribute to infection. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Chronic Pancreatitis \nSee Chapter 32, Unintentional Weight Loss. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nAn ERCP demonstrates mult iple 5mall stones within t he \nCBD, which are extracted. M5. R underwent cholecystec-\ntomy and recovered without Incident . \nor intestinal obstruction (large or small bowel). The associated nau-\nsea and vomiting can be seen with any of those diseases. However, \nthe combination of the location of the pain and the loud intestinal \nsounds that accompany the pain makes bowel obstruction the lead-\ning hypothesis. It will also be important to determine whether he \nhas unexplained hypotension or abdominal distention during his \nexam. Table 3-11 lists the differential diagnoses for Mr. J. \n\nConsidering each hypot hesis In t um (Table 3-11 ). Mr. J \nreports no change In his bowel habit s untll 4 days ago. Since \nthat time, he has been constipated and unable to pass \nstool or flatus. He also notes that 3 weeks ago, he saa \nsmall amount of blood on the stool. He has no prior history \nof intra-abdominal surgeries, hernias, or diverticulitis. He \ndoes not have a smoking history (which Increases t he risk \nfor AM) and states that the pain does not radiate to his \nback. He has no risk factors for acute mesenterlc lschemla \n(no prior history of at rial ftbrillation, valvular heart dis-\nease or known hypercoagulable state). On physical exam, \nhe is intermittently very uncomfortable with episodes of \nsevere dfffuse cramping pain. Vital signs reveal orthostatlc \nhypoten5lon: supine BP. 110/75 mm Hg; pulse, 90 bpm; \nupright BP. 85/50 mm Hg; pulse, 125 bpm; temperature, \n37.0\"C; RR. 18 breaths per minute. He is anicteric. Cardiac \nand lung exams are unremarkable. On abdominal inspection \nthere is prominent distention. Auscultation shows inter-\nmittent rushes. Percussion Is tympanltlc and on palpation \nthere Is mild diffuse tenderness to exam without rebound \nor guarding. Stool ls 1:7rown and heme posit ive. \nThe constipation, absence of flatus, and rushing bowel sounds \nfurther increase the suspicion of bowel obstruction. The tympanitic \nabdominal distention is a pivotal finding suggesting accumulation \nof air in the abdomen, in this case most likely due to obstruction. \n\nTable 3-11.

Plain radiography reveals grossly distended \nascending colon, multiple air-fluid levels, and an abrupt \ntennination of air in the transverse colon (arrow) suggestive \noflarge bowel obstTuctton. \nThe pain is ofien diffuse and poorly local.im:l. Initially; the patient \nmay have several bowel movements as the bowel tlistaJ to the \nobstruction is emptied in the fust 12-24 houn. Bowel soWlds are \nhyperactive early in the course. Abdominal. di&tention is often pres-\nent. (Distention is less prominent in proximal SBOs.) At fust. the \npain is intermittent; later, the pain often becomes more constant, \nbowel sounds may diminish and become absent, constipation \nprogresses, and the patient becomes unable to pass flatus.

Bowel obstruction accounts for 4% of patients with \nabdominal pain. \nB. SBO accounts fur 76% of all bowel obstructions. \nC. Etiology \n1. Postsurgical adhesions, 70% \n2. Malignant tumor, 10-20% \na. Usually metastatic \nb. However, 39% of SBOs in patients with a prior \nmalignancy are due to adhesions or benign causes. \n3. Hernia (ventral, inguinal, or internal), 10% \n4. IBD (with stricture), 5% \n5. Radiation \n6. Less common causes of SBO include gallstones, bezoars, \nand intussusception. \nD. SBOs may be partial or complete. \n1. Complete SBO \na. 20--40% progress to strangulation and infarction. \nStrangulation may occur secondary to mesenteric \ntwisting cutting off the blood supply or due to \nincreasing intraluminal pressure directly compromising \nperfusion. \nb. Clinical signs do not allofor identification of \nstrangulation prior to infarction: Fever, leukocytosis, \nand metabolic acidosis are late signs of strangulation and \nsuggest infarction. \nc. 50-75% of patients admitted for SBO require surgery. \n\n2. Partial SBO \na. Rarely progresses to strangulation or infarction \nb. Characterized by continuing ability to pass stool or \nflatus(> 6-12 hours after symptom onset) or passage of \ncontrast into cecum \nc. Resolves spontaneously (without surgery) in 65-80% of \npatients \nEvidence-Based. Diagnosis \nA. Ideally, tests for SBO should identify obstruction and \nischemia or infarction, if present {since ischemia and \ninfarction are indications for emergent surgery rather \nthan further observation). Unfonunately, even tests that \nsuccessfully differentiate complete from partial SBO do not \nreliably determine whether there is ischemia and infarction. \nB. See test characteristics of history and physical exam under LBO. \nC. Physical exam findings are insensitive at predicting infarction. \nHowever, localized tenderness, rebound, or guarding would all \nsuggest infarction is present. \nD.

Randomized trials of patients with presumed adhesive \nSBO demonstrate reduced odds of surgical intervention \nin patients receiving gastrografin compared to controls \nOR (0.44-0.87). \nTreatment \nA. Fluid resuscitation \n1. IV rehydration is imponant to correct the prominent \nintravascular dehydration from decreased oral intake, \nvomiting, and third spacing of fluid within the bowel. \n2. Monitor vital signs, orthostasis, and urinary outpur \ncarefully. \nB. Careful, frequent observation and repeated physical exam over \nthe first 12-24 hours \nC. Nasogastric suction \nD. Broad-spectrum antibiotics arc recommended (59% of \npatients have bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph \nnodes), although evidence is limited. \nE. Water-soluble contrast for partial SBO that persists for \n48 hours. \nF. Indications for surgery include any of the following: \n1. Signs ofischemia (increased pain, fever, tenderness, \nperitoneal findings, acidosis, or worsening lcukocytosis) \n2. CT findings of infarction \n3. SBO secondary to hernia \n4. SBO clearly not secondary to adhesion (no prior surgery) \nAlternative Diagnosis: lschemic Bowel \nSecondary to Acute Mesenteric lschemia \nor lschemic Colitis \nIschemic Bowel \nThree distinct clinical subtypes of ischemic bowel include chronic \nmesenteric ischemia (chronic small bowel ischemia), acute mescn-\nteric ischemia (acute ischemia of small bowel), and ischemic colitis \n(ischemia of the large bowel). Chronic mcsenteric ischemia is dis-\ncussed at the end of the chapter. \n1. Acute Mesenteric lschemia \nTextbook Presentation \nAcute mesenteric ischemia is a life-threatening condition that \nvirtually always presents with the abrupt onset of acute severe \nabdominal pain that is typically out of proportion to a relatively \nbenign physical exam. Acute mesenteric ischemia usually occurs in \npatients with risk factors of systemic embolh:ation (cg, atrial fibril-\nlation) or anerial thrombosis. Unexplained metabolic acidosis can \nbe an imponant clue. \n\n46 I CHAPTER 3 \nDisease Highlights \nA. Etiology: Usually due to superior mesenteric anery or celiac \nanery embolism (50%). Other causes include thrombosis \n(15-25%), loflostates without obstruction (15-30%) \n(nonobstructive mesenteric ischemia), and mesenteric venous \nthrombosis (5%). \n1. Embolism \na. Risk factors include atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial \ninfarction, valvular hean disease, heart failure, \nventricular aneurysms, angiography of abdominal aona, \nand hypercoagulable states. \nb. The onset is often sudden without prior symptoms. \n2. Thrombosis \na. Usually occurs in patients with atherosclerotic disease of \nthe involved anery. \nb. Approximately half of such patients have a prior history \nof chronic mesenteric ischemia with intestinal angina. \n3. Nonobstructive mesenteric ischemia \na. May have an insidious onset \nb. Often occurs in elderly patients with mesenteric \natherosclerotic disease and superimposed hypotension \n(due to myocardial infarction, hean failure, dial)75is, \nor sepsis). Alpha-agonists, digoxin, and beta-blockers \nmay also increase the risk of nonobstructive mesenteric \nischemia. \nc. Also seen in critically ill patients after cardiopulmonary \nbypass or other major surgery \nd. Other causes include cocaine use and following \nendurance exercise activities (eg, marathon, cycling). \n4. Mesenteric venous thrombosis is often secondary to ponal \nhypertension, hypercoagulable states, and intra-abdominal \ninflammation. \nB. Patients have acute abdominal pain that is often out of \nproponion to their abdominal exam. If left untreated, bowel \ninfarction and peritoneal findings will develop. \nC. Incidence: 0.1--0.3% of hospital admissions, 1 % of patients \npresenting with abdominal pain, and up ro 10% of patients \n> 70-years-old presenting with abdominal pain. \nD. Mortality is high and increases with delay in treatment. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Abdominal pain out of proportion to exam is a classic \nfinding but is absent in 20-25%. Other common presenting \nsymptoms are vomiting (71 %) and diarrhea (42%). \nB. 50% of patients have a prior history of intestinal angina. \nC. Laboratory studies are nonspeciflc. \n1. The WBC is abnormal in 90% of patients and often \nmarkedly elevated (mean WBC 21.4 x 109/mL). \n2. Lactate level has a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of \n44%; LR+, 1.5; LR-, 0.32 \n~ \nA normal lactate level does not rule out acute \nV\" mesenteric ischemia. \nD. Standard CT scanning is insensitive for acute mesenteric \nischemia (64%). It may demonstrate superior mesenteric \nanery occlusion or findings suggesting ischemic and necrosis \nsuch as segmental bowel wall thickening or pneumatosis. \nOne study reported 100% sensitivity but patients were studied \n3 da}'5 after symptom onset, when infarction may have been \neasier to demonstrate. \nE. CT angiography is very accurate (93.3% sensitive, 95.9% \nspecific), rapidly available and fast. It is the initial study prior \nto angiography. Magnetic resonance angiography has also \nbeen used. \nRoutine CT scanning may not diagnose AMI. \nCTA is required. \nF. Catheter angiography is the gold standard and can also be \ntherapeutic. However, it is invasive, time consuming, and may \nnot be available on an emergent basis. \nG. Doppler ultrasonography is insensitive due to bowel \ndistention. \nTreatment \nA. Emergent revascularization (via thromboembolectomy, \nthrombol}'5is, vascular bypass, or angioplasty) and surgical \nresection of necrotic bowel are the mainsta}'5 of therapy. \nPrompt surgical intervention (< 12 hours) reduces mortality \ncompared with delayed intervention(> 12 hours) (14% vs 75%). \nB. Broad-spectrum antibiotics \nC. Volume resuscitation \nD. Preoperative and postoperative anticoagulation to prevent \nthrombus propagation \nE. For patients with nonobstructive mesenteric ischemia, improved \nperfusion is paramount. \nF. Intra-arterial papaverine improves mesenteric blood floby \nreducing reactive mesenteric aneriolar vasoconstriction. \n2. lschemic Colitis \nTextbook Presentation \nlschemic colitis typically presents with left-sided abdominal pain. \nPatients frequently have bloody or maroon stools or diarrhea. \nProfuse bleeding is unusual. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The most common form of intestinal ischemia \nB. Usually due to nonocclusive decrease in colonic perfusion \nC. Distribution \n1. Typically involves the watershed areas of the colon, most \ncommonly the splenic flexure, descending colon, and \nrectosigmoid junction. \n2. Right colonic involvement occurs occasionally. \n3. Rectal involvement is rare and suggests other diseases. \nD. Precipitating events may include hypotension, myocardial \ninfarction, sepsis, heart failure, or cardiac or aortic surgery but \nis usually not identified. \nE. Uncommon causes include \n1. Vasculitis \n2. Hypercoagulable states \n3. Vasoconstrictors \n4. Cocaine \nS. Vascular surgery \n\n6. Drugs {eg, alosetron} \n7. Long-distance running or bicycling (presumably due to \nshunting and hypoperfusion} \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Abdominal pain {not usually severe) is reported by 68-84% of \npatients. \nB. Hematochezia is a hdpful diagnostic clue when present \nbut not when absent. Sensitivity, 46%; specifkity, 90.9%; \nLR+, 5.1; LR-, 0.6 \nC. Diarrhea is seen in approximately 40% of patients. \nD. Abdominal tenderness is common {81 %), but rebound \ntenderness is rare {15%). \nE. Risk factors that increase the likelihood of ischemic colitis \ninclude \n1. Age > 60 years \n2. Hemodial)75is \n3. Cardiovascular disease \n4. Hypertension \n5. Diabetes mellltus \n6. Hypoalbuminemia \n7. Medications that induce constipation \nF. Features that distinguish acute mesenteric ischemia {small \nbowel} from ischemic colitis are summarized in Table 3-13. \nG. Colonoscopy (without preparation) is the preferred test to \nevaluate ischemic colitis. \nH.

He has never had pain like this before. He has \nsuffered 1 episode of vomiting and feels light headed. The \nemesls was yellow. He has moved his bowels once this morn-\ning and continues to pass flatus. There Is no change In his \nrowel habits, melena. or hematochezla. Nothing seems to \nmake the pain better or worse.

The first \npivotal point evaluates the location of the pain. Mr. I.:s pain is \ndiffuse, which limits the differential diagnosis. Common causes \nof diffuse mid abdominal pain include JBS; IBD; SBO or LBO; \nacute ischemia; AAA; diabetic ketoacidosis; gastroenteritis; and, \ngiven the radiation of pain to his back, pancreatitis, and nephro-\nlithiasis (Figure 3-1). Although this is an extensive differential, it \ncan be focused funher. Several of these diagnoses are very unlikely \nand need not be considered further. Given the lack of diarrhea and \nthe severity of pain, gastroenteritis is very unlikdy. His continued \nbowel movements and flatus make bowel obstruction unlikely \n(although this can be seen early in obstruction.) The lack of a his-\ntory of diabetes would make diabetic ketoacidosis unlikely, unless \nthis was the initial presentation; a simple blood sugar could help \nexclude this diagnosis. The second pivotal point which can serve \nto narrothe differential diagnosis is the time course of the pain, \nwhich is hyperacute. Of the remaining hypotheses, AAA, bowel \nischemia, pancreatitis, and nephrolithiasis can all present acutely, \nwhereas this would be very unlikely presentation of IBD or IBS. \nThe radiation to the left flank increases the likelihood of AAA, \nnephrolithiasis, and pancreatitis. Clearly, AAA is a must not miss \ndiagnosis. Other pivotal findings that can help narrothe differ-\nential diagnosis include peritoneal findings on exam, unexplained \nhypotension and abdominal distention. Table 3-14 lists the differ-\nential diagnoses for Mr. L. \n\nExploring each one of the hypotheses, Mr. L has no history \nof kidney stones or hematuria. He does not drink alcohol. He \nhas no histol)' of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, \nor hypercoagulable states. On reexamlnatlon, orthostatlc \nmaneuvers reveal profound orthostatlc hypotenslon. Supine \nBP and pulse were 110/65 mm Hg and 90 bpm. Upon stand-\ning his BP falls to 65/40 mm Hg and a pulse of 140 bpm. \nHe remains afebrile. Aqa in, you find that he lacks rebound or \nguarding and has moderate flank and back tenderness to \npercussion. His abdominal aorta cannot be palpated due to \nhis abdominal girth. Lower extremity pulses are Intact. Plain \nabdominal radlographs do not demonstrate free air. \n~ \nIs the clinical Information sufficient to make a \n1~r dlagnoele? If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nThe most dramatic and important pivotal physical finding is \nthe presence of profound onhostatic hypotension. It is critical \nto appreciate that his hypotension is clearly out of proportion to \ndehydration since he has only vomited once and his decreased oral \nintake only began 1 hour ago. As noted above unexplained hypo ten-\nsion is a pivotal finding that must be explained. The lack of dehy-\ndration suggests that the orthostatic hypotension is due to either \nintra-abdominal hemorrhage or sepsis (Table 3-3). He has no fever \nor chills to suggest sepsis, but this is still possible. A serious con-\nsideration is therefore massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage, either \nwithin the gastrointestinal tract or intraperitoneal. Massive gastro-\nintestinal hemorrhage always exits the bowel quickly resulting in \nobvious clinical findings, such as hematemesis, mdena, or hema-\ntochezia, and is rarely subtle. Therefore, you are more concerned \nabout intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Causes of massive intraperito-\nneal hemorrhage include AAA rupture, splenic rupture, or rupture \nof an ectopic pregnancy. The patient's history is most suggestive of \nAAA rupture. You call for a stat vascular surgery consult. \nTable 3-14.

Defined as an external diameter of the in&arenal abdominal \naorta of~ 3 cm. \nB. The lifetime risk of AAA in patients age 45 years through \n85 years is 5.6%. The highest lifetime risk of AAA is 17% in \nwhite male current smokers. \nC. 10,000 deaths per year in the United States \nD. Risk factors \n1. Smoking is the most significant risk factor (OR 5). \n2. Men are affected 4 to 5 times more often than women. \n3. Family history of AAA (OR 4.3) \n4. Increased age \nS. Hypertension (OR 1.2) \nE. Presentation \n1. Ruptured AAA \na. Monality with rupture is 81 %. Approximately 32% die \nbefore reaching a hospital. \nb. Misdiagnosis occurs in 16% of cases. (Most common \nmisdiagnosis is renal colic.) \n\nc. Rupture into the duodenum is a rare c:omplkation, is \nmore c:ommon in patients with prior AAA graft, and \nmay result in gastrointestinal bleeding over weeks. \n2. Symptomatic:, c:ontained \na. Rarely, patients present nonemergently with \nsymptomatic: c:ontained rupture of the abdominal aona. \nb. Symptoms are primarily sec:ondary to retroperitoneal \nhemorrhage and are oc:c:asionally present for weeks or \neven several years. \n3. Inflammatory AAA \na. Comprise about 5-10% of AAAs and usually oc:c:urs at a \nslightly younger age \nb. Typical features inc:lude chronic: abdominal pain and \nweight loss. \nc. Distinguishing c:harac:teristic: is marked inflammation of \naortic adventitia. \n4. Limb isc:hemia \na. AAA c:an present when intraluminal thrombus within \nthe aneurysmal sac: embolizes, leading to limb ischemia. \nb. Patients may present with blue toes from the \nembolization; this c:an oc:c:ur with or without rupture. \n5. Asymptomatic: AAA (disc:overed incidentally or on \nsc:reening) \na. The risk of rupture increases markedly as the diameter \nof the aneurysm increases. \nb. See Table 3~15. \nEvidence-Bued Diagnosis \nA. Ruptured AAA \n1. Abdominal pain, distention, a large abdominal ginh, and \nrupture all limit sensitivity of finding a pulsatile mass in \npatients with a ruptured AAA. \na.

Abdominal mass on careful exam 52% (only 18% had \nabdominal mass noted on routine abdominal exam) \n5. Hypotension or orthostasis 48% \n6. Leukocytosis (> 11,000/mcL) 70% \n7. Anemia (unusual) \nC. Inflammatory AAA \n1. Back pain or abdominal pain is usual presentation (80% of \npatients); rupture is rarely presenting manifestation. \n2. Symptoms of inflammation (fever, weight loss) present in \n20-50% of patients. \n3. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated in 40-90% of c:ases. \n4, CT or MRI reveal the aneurysm and marked thickening of \nthe aortic wall. Periaonic fat stranding may be seen. \nD. Asymptomatic AAA \nI. Sensitivity of focused exam for asymptomatic AAA is poor \noverall (31-39%) and only 82% among patients with large \nAAA~ 5 cm. \n2. The sensitivity of the physical exam is less in obese patients \n(53% in patients with waist circumference> 39 inches vs. \n91%<39 inches). \nE. Imaging \nI. CT angiography is very ac:curate for ruptured AAA:. sensitivity, \n98.3%; specificity, 94.9%; LR+, 19.3; LR-, 0.02 \n2. Bedside emergency ultrasound is accurate in symptomatic \npatients: sensitivity, 99%; specificity, 98%; LR+, 44.5; \nLR-, 0.01 \n3. For screening, ultrasound is preferred: sensitivity, 95%; \nspecificity, 100%. \n4. CT angiography is typically used for preoperative \nevaluation prior to repair of asymptomatic AAA. \nTreatment \nA. For ruptured AAA, proceed directly to the operating room. \nB. Sc:reening: See Chapter 2, Screening and Health Maintenance \nC. Timing of elective surgery \n1. Mortality with rupture exceeds 80%. Surgery is performed \nto minimize the risk of rupture. \n2. The risk of rupture increases substantially with increasing \nAAA diameter. \n3. The standard rec:ommendation is to dectively repair AAAs \n~ 5.5 cm or those that have increased in size by~ 1 cm in \n1 year. \n4. Other risk factors for rupture include smoking (hazard ratio \n2.0, 1.3-3.1) and female sex (hazard ratio 3.8, 2.6-5.5). \nHypertension also increases the risk. \nS. Some authorities rec:ommend repair in women when the \nAAA reaches 5.2 cm. \nD. Options inc:lude open surgical repair or endovasc:ular aneurysm \nrepair (EVAR). Comparing open surgery to EVAR: \n1. EVAR is more c:ommonly performed and has a lower \n30~day morbidity and mortality compared to open surgery, \nbut no significant difference in overall survival. \n\n50 I CHAPTER 3 \n2. Open surgical repair is recommended for patients who \ncannot comply with periodic long-term surveillance or with \naneurysms not amenable to EVAR. \nE. Surveillance of small AAA (3.0-5.4 cm) \n1. Patients should undergo surveillance by repeat \nultrasonography every 3-12 months, with surgical referral \nfor growth> 1.0 cm per year or a total diameter:<!: 5.5 cm. \n2. Ultrasound may underestimate the diameter of a AAA. \nOne study reported that 73% of patients found to have an \nAAA of 5-5.4 cm on ultrasound had an aneurysm that was \n~ 5.5 cm on CT. \n3. AAA in females should be monitored by aneurysm \ndiameter intlexed to body size, as this is more predictive of \nrupture than the absolute diameter. \nF. Nonsurgical management \n1. Smoking cessation has been shown to sloAAA growth. \n2. No medication definitively reduces AAA growth. \n3. AA& are considered a coronary equivalent. Aspirin and \nstatins are recommended. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nFurther evaluation (eg, with CT or ultrasonography) at this \npoint depends on the index of suspicion. An emergent bed-\nside ultrasound Is the preferred test in this situation. If \nunavailable, and AAA Is very likely and. the patient unstable, \nmany vascular surgeons proceed directly to the operating \nroom without further studies in order to avoid the poten-\ntial lethal delay of obtaining a CT scan. Jf AAA is less likely \nand the patient is stable, GT scanning is appropriate. \nHaV1s you croe&ed a diagno&tic thnsehold for \nthe leading hyPOtheele, MA1 Have you rul&I \nout the active alternatlvH1 Do other teete \nneed to be done to e>eclude the altematlve \ndlagtt09891 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Nephrolithiasis \nTextbook Presentatlon \nPatients typically experience a rapid onset of excruciating back and \nflank pain, which may radiate to the abdomen or groin. The inten-\nsity of the pain is often dramatic as patients writhe and move about \nconstantly (unlike peritonitis) in an unsuccessful attempt to get \ncomfortable. The pain may be associated with nausea, vomiting, \ndysuria, or urinary frequency. \nAbdominal tmdnness is unusual in patients \nwith nephrolithiasis and should raise doubt \nabout the diagnosis. \nDisea.se Highlights \nA. Incidence: Symptomatic stones develop in 7-13% of people \nin the United States. \n1. 35-50% recurrence at 5 years \n2. Men affected 2-3 times more often than women \n3. Positive family history increases the risk (relative risk 2.6) \nB. Etiology \n1. Calcium oxalate stones 75% \n2. Calcium phosphate stones (CaPO ,J 5% \n3. Uric acid stones 5-10% \n4. Struvite stones (MgNH4POJ 5-15% \n5. Other: cystine and indinavir stones \nC. Pathophysiology \n1. Stones form when the concentration of salts (ie, calcium, \noxalate, or uric acid) becomes supersaturated in the urine \nresulting in precipitation and crystallization. \n2. Supersaturation is secondary to a combination of increased \nurinary salt excretion combined with inadequate diluting \nurinary volume. Numerous mechanisms can contribute to \nan increase in urinary mineral excretion including: \na. Calcium: idiopathic hypercalciuria, hypercalcemic \ndisorders, primary hyperparathyroidism, \nimmobilization, exce~ive sodium intake (which \nincreases calcium excretion), systemic acidosis, and \nexcessive vitamin D supplementation \nb. Uric acid: Excessive dietary purines, myeloproliferative \ndisorders, uricosuric agents (for the treatment of gout), \nand metabolic syndrome. Lourine pH also contributes \nto uric acid stone formation. Hyperuricosuria can \nlead to uric acid stones or calcium stones due to \nheterogeneous ossification. \nc. Oxalate: Increased excretion may be secondary to \nexcessive oxalate intake (rhubarb, spinach, chocolate, \nnuts, vitamin C) and/or increased oxalate absorption. \n(1) Fat malabsorption increases oxalate absorption. \nThe unabsorbed fat competes with oxalate to bind \ncalcium leading to more intraluminal oxalate that is \nnot bound to calcium. Unbound oxalate is absorbed \nand excreted in the urine. \n(2) Causes of fat malabsorption include short bowel \nsyndrome, IBD, celiac disease, and bariatric \nsurgery. \n3. In some patients, a decrease in urinary stone inhibitors \n(urinary citrate) also contribute to stone formation. \n4. Infection with urea-splitting organisms (ie, Proteus) plays a \nkey role in the formation of struvite stones (MgNH.PO J. \n5. Renal colic develops when stones dislodge from the kidney \nand obstruct urinary flow. \nD. Complications \n1. Ureteral obstruction \n2. Pyelonephritis \n3. Sepsis \n4. Acute kidney injury is rare, occurring in patients \nwith bilateral obstruction or obstruction of a solitary \nfunctioning kidney. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The evaluation is directed at establishing the diagnosis of \nnephrolithiasis and its underlying etiology so that measures to \nprevent its recurrence can be implemented. \nB. Establishing the diagnosis \n1. Gross or microscopic hemaruria is neither very sensitive nor \nspecific for symptomatic nephrolithiasis. Sensitivity, 80%; \nspecificity, 41 %; LR+, 1.4; LR-, 0.49 \n\n.... --...... The absence of hematuria does not rule out \ny \nnephrollthi.asis. \n2. Radiographs (kidneys, ureters, bladder) or ultrasound \nare not sufficiently sensitive to rule out nephrollthiasis \n(sensitivity 29-68% and 32-57%, respectively). \n3. Noncontrast renal CT is the test of choice. \na. Sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 98%; LR+, 48; LR-, 0.05 \nb. Importantly, CT scan revealed alternative diagnoses in \n33% of patients in whom nephrolithi.asis was clinically \nsuspected. \n4. In pregnant women, ultrasonography is the test of choice. \nC. Evaluation of documented nephrolithiasis \n1. All patients should have a urinalysis and culture and basic \nserum chemistries, including several measurements of \nserum calcium. Urine culture, pH, and chemical analysis of \nany retrieved stones are also recommended. \n2. A more comprehensive evaluation, including several \n24-hour urine specimens for analysis of calcium, oxalate, \nuric acid, sodium, creatinine, and citrate as well as \nsubmission of retrieved stones for chemical analysis, is \nrecommended for patients with recurrent stones. Some \nexperts recommend this for patients with their first stone. \nTreatment \nA. Pain control \n1. NSAIDs \na. Treat pain and diminish spasm \nb. To be avoided 3 days before lithotripsy due to \nantiplatelet effects \n2. Opioids are second line. \nB. Hydration (oral if tolerated, otherwise IV) \nC. Hospitali:zation indicated for uncontrolled pain, persistent \nnausea or vomiting, acute kidney injury, or signs of infection. \nD. Sepsis or acute kidney injury due to bilateral obstruction or \nunilateral obstruction in a solitary kidney \n1. Necessitates emergent drainage (via percutaneous \nnephrostomy tube or ureteral stent) \n2. For sepsis, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics to cover gram-\nnegative organisms and enterococcus should also be \nadministered. \nE. Stone passage \n1. Nifedipine and alpha-blockers have been shown to \nsignificantly increase the likelihood of stone passage. \n2. Llthotripsy or ureteroscopy can be used to remove \npersistent ureteral stones. \nF. Secondary prevention \n1. Patients with a single calcium stone: \na. Increasing fluid intake to ~ 2 Uday decreases the risk of \nrecurrent stones (relative risk, 0.45; 0.24-0.84). \nb. Reducing phosphate-containing soft drinks may \ndecrease recurrences (relative risk, 0.83; 0.71-0.98). \n2. For patients with recurrent idiopathic calcium stones other \noptions include: \na. Thiazide diuretics decrease urinary calcium \nexcretion (especially when combined with potassium \nsupplementation) (relative risk, 0.52, 0.39-0.69). \nABDOMINAL PAIN I 51 \nb. Citrate supplementation is effective in patients with and \nwithout hypocitraturia (relative risk, 0.25, 0.14-0.44). \nc. Allopurinol in patients with concomitant hyperuricemia \nor hyperuricosuria (relative risk, 0.59, 0.42-0.84). \n3. More specific management (ie, dietary modification) is \ncomplex and depends on the underlying etiology of the \npatient's nephrolithiasis. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nAn emergent bedside ult rasound reveals a massively dilated \naorta (9 cm) with 500 mcL of adjacent fluid (presumed \nblood). Emergent surgery reveals a leaki~ MA that rup-\ntures intraoperatlvely. The aorta Is cross clamped. repaired, \nand the patient is stabilized. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nIrritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) \nTatbook Presentation \nPatients often complain of intermittent abdominal pain accom-\npanied by diarrhea or constipation or both of years' duration. The \ndiarrhea is often accompanied by cramps that are relieved with \ndefecation. Pain cannot be explained by structural or biochemical \nabnormalities. Weight loss or anemia should alert the clinician to \nother possibilities. \nNepersistent changes in bowel habits (either \ndiarrhea or constipation) should be thoroughly \nevaluated to exclude colon cancer, IBD, or \nanother process. An assumption ofIBS in such \npatients is inappropriate. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Affects 8.9% of men and 14% of women. \nB. Etiology is a combination of altered motility, visceral hyper-\nsensitivity, autonomic dysfunction, and psychological factors. \nC. Symptoms are often exacerbated by psychological or physical \nstressors. \nD. Patients may have pain associated primarily with diarrhea \n(IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C) or a mixed bowel pattern \n(IBS-M). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. There are no known biochemical or structural markers for \nIBS. \nB. A variety of symptoms are common in patients with IBS \nincluding lower abdominal pain, passage of mucous, feeling \nof incomplete evacuation, loose or frequent stools at onset of \npain, and pain relieved by defecation. However, none of these \nare very predictive (LR+, 1.3-2.1; LR-, 0.59-0.88). \nC. Only abdominal pain is very sensitive (sensitivity, 90%; \nspecificity, 32%) and is also required by the criteria. \nD. Diarrhea pattern \n1. One study suggested that patients with diarrhea-\npredominant IBS were more likely to have irregularly \n\n52 I CHAPTER 3 \nirregular diarrhea that fluctuated over dayi; whereas patients \nwith inflammatory diseases (IBD and c:eliac disease) were \nmore likely to have persistent diarrhea that fluctuates over \nmonths. \n2. Persistent diarrhea increased the likelihood ofIBD (LR+, 4.2). \n3. A more extensive wor~up may be indicated in patients \nwith persistent, constant diarrhea. \nE. The diagnosis is usually made by a combination of \n(1) a consistent history, (2) the absence of alarm features, \nand (3) a limited work-up to exclude other diseases. \n1. Consistent history \na. Although a variety of criteria have been developed \n(ie, Rome criteria), a recent revieby the American \nCollege of Gastroenterology suggested a consistent \nhistory was abdominal pain or discomfort that occurs in \nassociation with altered bowel habits for at least 3 months. \nb. Patients may also report a relief of pain with defecation. \n2. Alarm symptoms (suggest alternative diagnosis and \nnecessitate evaluation) \na. Positive fecal occult blood test or rectal bleeding \nb. Anemia \nc. Unintentional and unexplained weight loss \nd. Fever \ne. Family history of colorectal cancer, IBD, or celiac \ndisease \nf. Recent antibiotic use \n3. Limited work-up \na. A CBC is appropriate to rule out anemia, which would \nsuggest alternative diagnoses, and CRP to rule out \ninflammatory diseases. \nb. Other diagnostic testing is not recommended for young \npatients without alarm features, with the exception of \nserologic testing for celiac disease in patients with IBS-D. \n(1) Although recommended by the American College of \nGastroenterology, one study found the incidence of \nconfirmed celiac disease in IBS-D patients (without \nalarm features) to be very lo(0.41 %) and not \ndifferent from asymptomatic patients. \n(2) May best be reserved for the subset ofIBS-D \npatients with other possible clues suggesting celiac \ndisease (eg, anemia, autoimmune disease, or family \nhistory) \nc. Lactose hydrogen breath testing can be considered if \nlactose intolerance remains a concern despite dietary \nlactose restriction. \nd. There is no evidence that routine flexible sigmoidoscopy \nor colonoscopy is necessary in young patients without \nalarm symptoms. \ne. Colonoscopy is recommended in patients with alarm \nsymptoms and in those aged :2!: 50 years (if not already \nperformed). Biopsy is also recommended in patients \nwith IBS-D to rule out microscopic colitis. \nf. The following should also be evaluated in patients with \nalarm symptoms: \n(1) Stool for occult blood \n(2) Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels \n(3) Basic chemistries \n(4) Stool for Clostridium difficile toxin and presence of \nova and parasites \n(5) A variety of serum and fecal markers, including \nASCA, pANCA, fecal calprotectin, and fecal \nlactoferrin, are useful in selected patients and can \nsuggest bowel inflammation or IBD. \nTreatment \nA. Nonspecifk management. A variety of treatments have been \nshown to be effective in IBS including: \n1. Eliminate foods which cause gas and aggravate symptoms \nsuch as lactose, beans, cabbage, onions, Brussels sprouts, \ncauliflower, and broccoli. \n2. Physical activity \n3. Antispasmodics (including hyoscine and peppermint oil) \nhelp decrease abdominal pain. \n4. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake \ninhibitors may reduce persistent symptoms. \n5. Dietary flber (psyllium) may be effective. Studies are \nconflicting. \nB. Specific therapy is based on predominant syndrome. \n1. Diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) \na. Patients with IBS-D should have a trial oflactose-free \ndiet. Such treatment in lactase-deflcient individuals with \nIBS markedly reduces outpatient visits. \nb. Loperamide reduces diarrhea (but not abdominal pain \nor bloating). \nc. A single, short course of rifaximin (a nonabsorbed \nantibiotic) is helpful. \nd. Alosetron is a 5HT_,-receptor antagonist whose use \nis restricted to a risk management program by the \nUS Food and Drug Administration due to the risk of \nischemic colitis. Expert consultation recommended. \nc. Probiotic treatment with Bifitlobaama may improve \nsymptoms. \n2. Constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C) \na. Lubiprostone \n(1) A selective C-2 chloride channd activator is more \neffective than placebo in women. \n(2) Premenopausal women should have a negative \npregnancy test before starting the medication and \nmaintain contraception while taking lubiprostone. \n(3) Not yet recommended in men \nAlternative Diagnosis: Diverticulitis \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients typically complain of a constant gradually increasing left \nlower quadrant abdominal pain, usually present for several dayi;. \nDiarrhea or constipation and fever are often present. Guarding and \nrebound may be seen. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Diverticula are outpouchings of the colonic wall that \nmay be asymptomatic (diverticulosis), become inflamed \n(diverticulitis), or hemorrhage. \nB. Diverticulosis \n1. Devdops in 5-10% of patients aged> 45 years, 50% in \npersons aged> 60 years, and 80% in those aged> 85 years. \n2. Low-6ber diets are believed to cause diverticula by \ndecreasing stool bulk, resulting in increased intraluminal \n\npressure causing the mucosa and submuc:osa to herniate \nthrough weakness in the colonic: wall created by penetrating \nvessels. \nC. Diverticulitis \n1. Develops secondary to microscopic: or frank perforation of \ndivertic:ula. \n2. 85-95% of diverticulitis oc:c:urs in sigmoid or descending \ncolon \n3.

Simultaneous divertic:ular hemorrhage and div\"ticulitis \nare unusual; diverticular hemorrhage is discussed in \nChapter 19, G I Bleeding. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Left lower quadrant tenderness increases the likelihood of \ndiverticulitis; LR+, 3.4; LR-, 0.41. \nB. Neither fever nor leukocytosis is very sensitive for diverticulitis \nor divenicular abscess. \n1. In patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, only 45% \nhad temperature of;;: 38.0\"C or WBC > 11,000/mcL. \n2. In patients with diverticular abscess, only 64% of \npatients had temperature oh 38.0\"C and 62% had \nWBC > 11,000/mcL. \nC. Plain radiographs may demonstrate free air or obstruction. \nD. CTscan \n1. Test of choice in men and nonpregnant women \n2.

Colonoscopy \n1. Colon cancer can be mistaken for diverticulitis on CT. \n2. All patients with diverticulitis should have follow-up \ncolonoscopy (unless one has recently been performed) \ndelayed 4-6 weeks until there is a resolution of acute \ninflammation. \nTreatment \nA. Outpatient management is appropriate for patients with a \nmild attack (ie, patients without marked fever or marked \nleukoc:ytosis, pain manageable with oral analgesics, tolerating \noral intake) and without signifkant comorbidities, immuno-\ncompromise, or advanced age. \n1. Antibiotics \na. Antibiotics have routinely been administered to all \npatients with diveniculitis. \nb. Recent guidelines have questioned the utility of this \napproach. \nc.

High-flber diet once the attack has resolved \nChronic Mesenteric lschemia \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with chronic mesenteric isc:hemia typically complain of \nrecurrent postprandial abdominal pain (often in the first hour and \ndiminishing 1-2 hours later), food fear, and weight loss. Patients \noften have a history of tobacco use (75%), peripheral vascular dis-\nease (55%), coronary anery disease (43%), or hypenension (37%). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Usually secondary to near obstructive atherosclerotic disease of \nthe superior mesenteric artery or celiac artery or both. \nB. Arterial stenosis results in an imbalance between intestinal oxygen \nsupply and demand that is accentuated after eating leading to \nintestinal angina resulting in food fear and weight loss. \nC. Two or more vessels {ie, superior mesenteric anery and celiac \nartery) are involved in 91 % of affected patients. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Abdominal pain \nI. Oc:c:urs in 94% and is postprandial in 88%. \n2. It is typically epigastric: or periumbilic:al. \n3. Typically develops in the first hour after eating and \ndiminishes 1-2 hours later. \nB. Weight loss occurs in 78% of patients and is due to food aversion. \nC. Diarrhea oc:curs in 36% of patients. \nD. An epigastric: bruit has been reported in 63% of patients \n(17-87%). \nE. The abdomen is typically nontender even during a severe \nepisode of pain. \n\n54 I CHAPTER 3 \nF. Although stenoses are common in older patients (18% of \npopulation over age 65 years}, symptomatic: chronic: isc:hemia \nis rare, and documented stenosis does not confirm the diagnosis \nof mesenteric: isc:hemia. It is important to exclude more \ncommon disorders (ie, PUD and gallstone disease}. \nG. Duplex ultrasonography is very sensitive(> 90%) and c:an be \nused as the initial diagnostic: tool. Normal results make the \ndiagnosis very unlikely. \nH. CT angiography and magnetic: resonance angiography have \nalso been used. Angiography should be considered if the \nresults of noninvasive testing suggest vascular obstruction. \nTreatment \nR.cvascularization (by surgical endartercc:tomy, bypass grafting, or \npercutaneous endovascular repair) is the only treatment. \nREFERENCES \nAAA \nBiancari F, Poane R, Venermom M, D'Andrea V.

Stern, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr.Lis a 42-year-old man wrth type 1 diabetes mellitus \n(DM) who complains of weakness, anorexia, and vomrting. \nLaboratory studies demonstrate a HC011 - of 6 mEq!L. \nHis very loHCQ3- suggests a significant acid-base abnormal-\nity. In addition to evaluating his abdominal pain, exploring his \nacid-base disorder is critical. \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe differential diagnosis of acid-base disorders is extensive \n(Table 4-1) hue can easily be organized into 4 distinct subsets by first \ndetermining whether the primary disorder is a (1) metabolic acido-\nsis, (2) metabolic alkalosis, (3) respiratory acidosis, or (4) respiratory \nalkalosis. The key pivotal feature that allows the clinician to narro\nthe differential to 1 of these subsets is to fim evaluate the pH and \nthen the HC03- and PaC02 \nStep 1: Determine Whether the Primary \nDisorder is an Acidosis or Alkalosis by \nReviewing the pH1 \nA. pH < 7.4 indicates the primary disorder is an acidosis. \nB. pH > 7.4 indicates the primary disorder is an alkalosis. \nStep 2: Determine Whether the Primary Acidosis \nor Alkalosis is Metabolic or Respiratory by \nReviewing the HC01 - and PaC02 \nA. Recall that C02 + Hp ~ H2C03 ~ \nHCO,- + H; therefore \n1The pH and PaC02 are typically measured utilizing an arterial blood \ngas (ABG.) Altemativdy, a peripheral venoblood gas (VBG) can be used \nto estimate the pH. A meta-analysis suggested the VBG pH was similar but \nslightly lower (0.033) than the arterial pH (0.015-0.051). However, the \nvenous PC02 did not reliably predict the arterial PaC02  VenoPaC02 \nwas higher with a wide and unpredictable range (from -10.7 to +2.4) and \nshould not be used to evaluate acid-base disturbances. \nB. PaC02 changes drive pH as follows: \n1. Increased PaC02 drives reaction to right: This increases H \nwhich lowers pH, resulting in a respirawry acidosis. \n2. Decreased PaC02 drives reaction to left: This decreases H \nwhich raises pH, resulting in a respiratory a/kalotis. \nC. HCQ3- changes drive pH as follows: \n1. Increasing HCO~- drives the reaction to left: This consumes \nH which raises the pH, resulting in a metabolic alltalosis. \n2. Decreasing HCO,- drives the reaction to the right: This \nincreases H which lowers the pH, resulting in a metabolic \nacidosis. This occurs in 2 situations: \na. Processes that produce H ion (and consume HC03-) \n{ie, ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis) \nb. Processes that lose HCQ3- (ie, diarrhea) \nD. For acidosis (pH < 7.4) \n1. HC03- < 24 mEq/L: The primary disorder is a metabolic \nacidosis \n2. PaC02 > 40 mm Hg: The primary disorder is a respiratory \nacidosis \nE. For alkalosis (pH > 7.4) \n1. HC03- > 24 mEq/L: The primary disorder is a metabolic \nalkalosis \n2. PaC02 < 40 mm Hg: The primary disorder is a respiratory \nalkalosis \nThis is summarh:ed in Table 4-2. \nStep 3: Narrothe Differential Diagnoses \nof Metabolic Acidosis by Calculating the \nAnion Gap \nThe differential diagnosis fur metabolic acidosis is extensive but \ncan be narrowed based on whether the anion gap is normal or \nelevated. The anion gap is an estimate of the unmeasured anions. \nAs noted above, metabolic acidoses may be caused by processes \nthat either (1) produce acid {ie, ketoacids, lactic acid, sulfates, \nphosphates, or other organic acids), or by (2) processes that lose \nHC03- in the urine or stool {ie, diarrhea). Processes that produce \nacid (eg, ketoacidosis) also produce their associated unmeasured \nanions, which accumulate, resulting in an increased anion gap. \nTherefore, an elevated anion gap suggests one of those processes is \nthe cause of the metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, processes \nthat lose H CO 3 - do not generate unmeasured anions and the anion \ngap remains normal. Therefore, this simple calculation can help \nfocus the differential diagnosis {Table 4-1). \nA. Anion gap= Na- {HCQ3- +Cl-) \nB. 12  4 is often cited as an ideal cutoff, although in some insti-\ntutions, a normal anion gap is only 7-9 mEq/L. \n\n56 I CHAPTER 4 \nTable4-1.

The normal anion gap is affected by the serum albumin levd. \n1. Albumin is negatively charged so that lower serum albumin \nlevels are associated with a lower anion gap. \n2. The normal anion gap is 2.5 mEq/L lower, for every 1 g/dl. \ndrop in the serum albumin (belo4.4 g/dL). \n3. The reference range at the instirutlon performing the tests \nshould be used. \nD. An increased anion gap suggests that an anion gap mttabolic \nacidosis is present. \nStep 4: Explore the Differential Diagnoses \nof the Primary Disorder \nAfter identifying the primary disorder as a metabolic or respiratory \nacidosis or alkalosis the differential diagnosis should be explored, \n\nTable 4-2.

This information allows the \nclinician to rank the differential diagnosis and then determine the \nappropriate testing strategy. \nStep 5: Diagnose Primary Disorder \nSynthesize the clinical and laboratory information to arrive at a \ndiagnosis of the primary acid-base disorder. \nStep 6: Check for Additional Disorders \nUnfornmately, many patients have more than one simultaneous \nacid-base disturbance. Two final steps help clinicians recognize \nthese situations. \nStep 6A: Calculate Anion Gap (Even in Patients \nWithout Acidosis) to Uncover Unexpected \nAnion Gap Metabolic Acidosis \nPatients may have a simultaneous metabolic alkalosis (raising \nthe HCO,-) and an anion gap acidosis (lowering the HCO;). \nDepending on which is more severe, the HCO; can be low, nor-\nmal, or high. If the H CO 3 - is normal or high, it is easy to overlook \nthe anion gap metabolic acidosis (which may be quite important.) \nSince the anion gap would remain elevated if an anion gap meta-\nbolic acidosis is present, a quick check of the anion gap can be an \nimportant clue to an otherwise unnoticed metabolic acidosis. \nAlways check the anion gap. An elevated gap \nsuggests an anion ~P metabolic acidosis even \nwhen the HCO; ts above normal. \nStep 68: Calculate Whether Compensation \nIs Appropriate \nA. The acid-base system attempts to maintain homeostasis. \nAlterations in the respiratory or metabolic system trigger \ncompensatory changes in the other system to minimize the \nchange of pH. For instance, in metabolic acidosis, the respi-\nratory system hyperventilates to lower the PaC02 and thereby \ncreate a respiratory alltalosis that returns the pH closer to \nnormal (but never quite to normal). Table 4-3 illustrates the \ndirection of the compensatory change in acid-base disorders. \nTable 4-3.

Formulas predict the expected change in PaC02 to com-\npensate for metabolic processes and the expected change in \nHC03- to compensate for respiratory processes (Table 4-4). \nC. Compensation that is greater or less than expected suggests \nthat an atl.Jitional acid-base abnormality is present not just \ncompensation. \nD. If an additional process is implicated, the differential diagnosis \nfor that additional disorder should be explored. \nStep 7: Reach Final Diagnosis \nFigure 4-1 outlines the stepwise approach to acid-base disorders. \n\nMr. L reports t hat he has had dla betes since he was 1 0 years \nold.

Stepwise approach to the diagnosis of acid-base disorders. \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nStep 1: Determine Whether the Primary \nDisorder Is an Acidosis or Alkalosis by \nReviewing the pH \nAlthough an arterial pH has not yet been obtained, the \npatient's very loHC03- strongly suggests a metabolic acidosis. \nCommonly, sick patients are discovered to have a metabolic \nacidosis when a basic metabolic panel reveals a very loserum \nHC03-. Although theoretically, compensation for a respi-\nratory alkalosis could also cause a slight reduction in HC03-, \na HC03- in this range is almost never seen unless there is, in \nfact, a primary metabolic acidosis. Nonetheless, an arterial blood \ngas (ABG) measurement can document the acidosis and evaluate \nrespiratory compensation. \n\nABG: pH of 7.15, Pa02 of 80 mm Hg, and PaC02 of 20 mm Hg. \nThe lopH confirms t hat t he primary disorder is an \nacidosis. \n\nStep 2: Determine Whether the Primary Acidosis \nor Alkalosis Is Metabolic or Respiratory by \nReviewing the HC01 - and PaC02 \n\nHC03- = 6 mEq!Land PaC02 = 20 mm Hg. \nBoth the HCO;, - and PaC02 are low. Since only a loHC011-\nwou Id create an acidosis the prfma r-y disorder is a metabolic \nacidosis. (A loPaC02 drlvest;he pH up [see above].) \nStep 3: For Patients With Metabolic Acidoses, \nNarrothe Differential Diagnoses by \nCalculating the Anion Gap \n\nAnion gap = Na+ - (HC03 - + Cl-) = 138 - (6 + 100) = 32 \n(Normal= 12  4) \nClearly, the prlmar-y disorder Is an anion gap metabolic \nacidosis. By referring t;o Table 4-1, the differential diag-\nnosis can be narrowed t;o the remalnl~ posslbllltles of \ndiabetic lcetoacidosis (DKA), other lcetoacidoses, lactic \nacidosis, uremia. or t;oxin. \nTable 4-5. Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. L. \nACID-BASE ABNORMALITIES I 59 \nStep 4: Explore the Differential Diagnoses \nof the Primary Disorder \nThe history of childhood-onset DM strongly suggests insulin-\ndependent DM. This form of DM is associated with total or \nnear total insulin deficiency increasing the risk of DKA. This is \nthe leading hypothesis. Active alternative hypotheses include \nother ketoacidoses (starvation, alcohol) and uremia from chronic \nkidney disease (potentially secondary to long-standing diabetes). \nFinally, lactic acidosis (from hypoxemia or shock) is a Mmust not \nmiss diagnosis\" that should always be considered in sick patients \nwith metabolic acidosis.

Occurs primarily in patients with complete or near complete \ninsulin deficiency \nI. Type 1 autoimmune insulin-dependent DM \n2. Type 2 DM can cause OKA \na. Type 2 DM accounts for 12-47% DKA episodes \nb. OKA complicating type 2 DM is more frequently found \nin diabetic blacks and Hispanics than non-Hispanic \nwhites. (Up to 47% of Hispanic diabetics with DKA \nhad type 2 DM.) \nc. Many such patients can eventually be: treated with oral \nhypoglycemics without insulin after a short period of \ninsulin therapy. \n~ \nMany=~ ofDKAo=ain 'YI\" 2 DM. \n3. Diabetes secondary to severe chronic pancreatitis and near \ncomplete: islet cell obliteration \nB. Incidence is 4.6-8.0 cases/1000 person years in patients with \nDM. \nC.

The precipitant is the most frequent cause of mortality \ninDKA. \n2. Most common precipitants \na. Infection \n(1) Urinary tract infections and pneumonia are most \ncommon. \n(2) Patients may be: afebrile. \nb. Discontinuation of insulin or oral hypoglycemics \nc. New-onset type: 1 DM \n3. Other common precipitants include:: \na. Other infections \nb. MI \nc. Cerebrovascular accident \nd. Acute: pancreatitis \ne. Pulmonary embolism \nf. Gastrointestinal hc:morrhage \ng. Severe emotional stress \n4. Medications and drugs implicated in DKA include: \na. Failure of insulin pumps, and use: of corticosteroids, \nthiazides, cocaine, antipsychotics. \nb. SGLT2 inhibitors used to treat diabetes have: also caused \nDKA in some patients. \n(1) The: mechanism includes decreased release of insulin \n(due: to the: lower glucose levels), direct stimulation \nof glucagon release, and kc:togc:nic effects). \n(2) Risk may be accentuated in patients undergoing \nstressful events, such as surgery. \n(3) May be appropriate to avoid with concurrent \ninsulin use \n(4) Risk may be higher in patients with lower insulin \nlevels, such as LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes \nof the: adult). \n(5) Due to glucosuria, DKA in these patients is \noften associated with near normal glucose levels \n(mean 265 mg/dL). Therefore, a high index of \nsuspicion of DKA must be maintained. \nD. Pathogenesis of OKA: (Figure 4-2). The marked decrease in \ninsulin levels together with an increase in counterregulatory \nhormones lead to the following events: \n1. Hyperglycc:mia: Caused by \na. Marked insulin deficiency reduces cellular uptake of \nglucose \nb. Increased hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogc:nesis \nc. Oliguria: Hyperglycemia leads to an osmotic diuresis \n(polyuria) and dehydration. Oliguria eventually \ndevelops, which limits urinary glucose loss and thereby \naggravates hyperglycemia. \n2. Ketoacidosis \na. Marked insulin deficiency increases glucagon which, in \nturn, increases acetyl CoA production within liver. \nb. Massive production of acetyl CoA overwhelms Krebs \ncycle resulting in ketone production and kc:tonemia \n(primarily beta hydroxybutyric acid and to a lesser \nextent acetoacetic acid). \nc. Ketonemia leads to anion gap metabolic acidosis. \n3. Volume depletion: Ketonemia and hyperglycemia cause an \nosmotic diuresis, which results in profound dehydration \nand typical fluid losses of 3--6 L. \n4. Potassium loss \na. The osmotic diuresis also causes significant potassium \nlosses. \nb. Dehydration-induced hyperaldosteronism aggravates \npotassium loss. \nc. Typical potassium deficit is 3-5 mEq/.kg bodyweight. \nS. Hyperkalemia \na. Despite the total body potassium deficit, hyperkalemia \nis frequent. \nb. The etiology is multifactorial. \n(1) Insulin normally drives glucose and potassium into \nthe cells. Insulin tkficiency decreases cellular uptake \nand causes hyperkalemia. \n(2) Plasma hypertonicity drives water and potassium \nout of the cells and into the intravascular \ncompartment accentuating the hyperkalemia. \n6. Hyponatremia \nL As noted above, the hyperglycemia and kc:tonemia \ncreate an osmotic diuresis and free: water loss \nb. Despite this free water loss, many patients with DKA \nhave hyponatremia. \nc. Hyponatremia occurs because the hyperglycemia forces \nan osmotic efflux of water from the intracellular space \ninto the extracellular space, diluting the serum sodium. \nd. The elevated serum osmolality also stimulates \nantidiuretic hormone (ADH) release, which further \naggravates the hyponatrc:mia. \ne. With treatment, the glucose (and water) shifts \nintracellularly, increasing the serum sodium which \nmay actually rise above normal due to the water \ndeficit. \n\nACID-BASE ABNORMALITIES I 61 \nPslhophplology ol DKA \nDac111aaad \nInsulin dllficienoy 1------ lnsullnlglucagan rallo \nlnCf98118 In \nPl'llOipilllling llV1lnt \ncountamigulllklrf harmonae ------t (inleation, Ille) \n1 Lab finding 1 \nKeloacidollla \nFigure 4-2.

Effective osmolality can be calculated: \n(1) (2 x Na) + Glucose/18 \n(2) For example, a patient with a Na of 140 mEq/L \nand a glucose of720 mg/dL has an effective \nosmolality of320 mOsm/L \nb. Consider neurologic insult (eg, cerebrovascular accident, \ndrug intoxication) if neurologic changes are present in \npatients with a serum osmolality < 320 mOsm/L or if \nthe neurologic abnormalities fail to resolve with therapy. \n3.

More likely to be due to an intra~abdominal process \nrather than DKA, if the DKA is mild (the HCO~- is \ncloser to normal) \nd.

Nausea and vomiting are common and nonspecifk. \nC. Hyperglycemia \n1. Glucose level is variable. \n2. 15% of patients with DKA have glucose levels< 350 mg/dL, \nparticularly in \na. Pregnant patients \nb. Patients with poor oral intake \nc. Patients taking SLGT2 inhibitors \nd. Patients given insulin in route to the hospital \n3. An isolated glucose > 250 mg/dL has poor specificity for \nDKA(11%). \nD. Ketones \n1. 3 ketones: beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, acetone \n2. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in severe \nDKA. \na. Test of choice to evaluate DKA. \nb. Sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 79-85%; LR+ 6.5; LR-, \n0.02 (cutoff > 1.5 mmoUL) \nc. Compared to urine ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate \ntesting reduces frequency of hospitalization, shonens \ntime to recovery, and lowers costs \n3. Standard ketone test (with nitroprusside) is an older test \nbut insensitive for beta-hydroxybutyrate \n4. Urine ketones are sensitive for DKA (98%) but not specific \n(35-69%). Blood measurements are preferred. \nE. Anion gap \n1. Anion gap is elevated in most patients with DKA \n(even when nitroprusside reaction is negative). \n2. In patients evaluated in the emergency department with \nglucose> 250 mgldL, the anion gap is 84-90% sensitive \nand 85-99% specific; LR+, 6-84; LR-, 0.11-0.16. \n3. If anion gap is elevated and ketones are negative, beta-\nhydroxybutyrate measurements should be measured. Ifbeta-\nhydroxybutyrate measurements are not available (or negative), \nlactic acid should be measured to rule out lactic acidosis. \nF. Nonspeciflc findings \n1. Amylase: Nonspeciflc elevations in amylase are common. \n2. Leukocytosis \na. Mild leukocytosis (10,000-15,000 cells/mcL) is \ncommon and may occur secondary to stress or infection. \nb. One study documented higher WBCs in DKA patients \nwith major infection than in patients without infection \n(17,900/mcL vs 13,700/mcL). \nc. Band counts were also higher in patients with infection \n(23% Vli 6%). \nTreatment \nA. Treatment ofDKA includes the following principles outlined \nin detail below: \n1. Initial evaluation andfequmt monitoring \n2. Detection and treatment of the underlying precipitant \nThe most common cause of death in patients \nwith DKA is the underlying precipitant. It \nmust be discovered and treated. \n3. Fluid resuscitation \n4. Insulin \nS. Potassium replacement \nB. Initial evaluation and monitoring \n1. Vital signs and onhostatic vital signs should be measured. \n2. Check electrolytes, glucose, serum ketones, serum beta-\nhydroxybutyric acid, serum lactate, ABG, anion gap, \nplasma osmolality, blood urea nitrogen (BUN}, and \ncreatinine. \n3. Serum creatinine may be artificially elevated due to \ninterference of assay by ketones. \n4. The serum glucose should be checked hourly and \nthe electrolytes should be measured frequently \n(every 2-4 hours) and the anion gap calculated. \nC. Detection and treatment of the underlying precipitant \n1. A careful physical exam, including examination of \nthe feet should look for infection or other underlying \nprecipitant. \n2. Urinalysis and urine culture, chest radiograph, CBC with \ndifferential, ECG, and troponin levels are appropriate. \n3. Human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit should be \nmeasured in women of childbearing age. \n4. Other tests as clinically indicated (blood cultures, lipase, \netc.) \nD. Fluid resuscitation \n1. Evaluate dehydration: Check BP, onhostatic BP and pulse, \nmonitor hourly urinary output \n2. IV normal saline 1-2 L bolus initially. \na. Larger volumes (1-2 L) are useful for patients with \nsignificant hypotension. \nb. Smaller volumes (500 mL) may allofor more rapid \ncorrection of acidosis in patients without marked \nvolume depletion. \nc. Reevaluate patients after each liter by rechecking BP, \nonhostatic BP and pulse, urinary output, cardiac and \npulmonary exams. Repeat boluses until hypotension \nand oliguria resolve. \nd. Once hypotension resolves, decrease normal saline to \n500 mUh for 4 hours and then 250 mUh for 4 hours. \n3. If patients become hypernatremic with therapy (see above), \nnormal saline should be switched to 0.45% (after their \nvolume is restored) to correct the free water deficit. \nE. Insulin \n1. The ADA recommends an IV bolus of regular insulin \n(0.1 units/kg) followal by IV regular insulin at 0.1 units/kglh. \nAlternatively, the bolus may be omitted and the insulin \ninitiated at 0.14 units/kg/h. If glucose fails to fall by ~ 10% \nin first hour, adjust insulin therapy. \n2. Marked hypokalemia ( < 3.3 mEq/L) should be excluded \nbefore insulin therapy is administered (see below). \n3. Administer in monitored setting \n\n4. Monitor glucose levels hourly: Target reduction \n75-90 mg/dUh and adjust insulin dose accordingly. \n5. The ADA recommends continued N insulin until glucose \n< 200 mg/ dL and 2 of the following criteria are met: anion \ngaps; 12, serum HCO,- is~ 15 mEq/L, and the venous \npH>7.3. \na. Premature discontinuation of N insulin may result in \nrebound ketoacidosis. \nb. If patient's glucose normalizes(< 200 mmoVday) before \nthe anion gap normalizes and before the HC03- is \n~ 18 mEq/L, reduce (but do not stop) the insulin \ninfusion and add glucose (D5W or DlOW) to the \nIV to prevent hypoglycemia. \nc. Patients should receive their first dose of SQ insulin \n1-2 hours before N insulin is discontinued in order \nto prevent an insulin-free windoand recurrent \nketoacidosis. \nIn OKA, it is important to continue N insu-\nlin until the anion gap returns to normal. \nAdminister glucose as necessary to prevent \nhypoglycemia. \nF. Potassium replacement \n1. Insulin shifts potassium back into the intracellular \ncompartment. Fluid resuscitation and correction of the \nacidosis further lower the serum potassium concentration. \n2. Despite hyperkalemia on presentation, profound and \npotentially life-threatening hypokalemia is a common \ncomplication of therapy and often develops within the first \nfehours. \n3. Patients with normal or near normal serum potassium \nconcentrations on admission are, therefore, at higher risk \nof life-threatening hypokalemia with treatment and should \nhave cardiac monitoring due to the risk of arrhythmias. \n4. Potassium levels should be monitored hourly, and \nreplacement should be initiated when urinary output \nresumes and potassium is< 5.0-5.2 mEq/L. \n5. Potassium therapy should be initiated immediately \nin patients with hypokalemia. In addition, insulin \ntherapy should be delayed until the serum potassium \nis :> 3.3 mEq/L. \nG. HC03- therapy \n1. Use is controversial; if used, monitor patients for \nhypokalemia. \n2. HCO - has not been shown to improve outcomes in \npatien'ts with a serum pH :> 6.9. It may also paradoxically \nlower CNS pH. \n3. The ADA recommends HCO,- therapy in patients with a \npH< 6.9. \nH. Phosphate therapy \n1. Dramatic falls in serum phosphate are common during \ntreatment. \n2. Replacement should be considered in patients with marked \nhypophosphatemia (< 1.0 mg/dL) or with respiratory \ndepression, cardiac dysfunction, or anemia. \n~ \nCareful, frequent observation and evaluation of \nV\" patients with OKA is critical. \nACID-BASE ABNORMALITIES I 63 \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nHave you croeeed a diagnoetic threehold for \nthe leading hyPOtheeie, DKA1 Have you ruled \nout the active alternatfvee uremfa, etarvation \nketosis, alcoholic ketoacidosls, or lactic \nacldoele1 Do other teete need to be done to \nexclude the altematlve dlagnoees1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Uremic Acidosis \nTatbook Presentation \nTypically, patients with chronic kidney disease have loHCO,-\nlevels, high creatinine levels (often :> 4-5 mg/dL), and elevated \nBUN and phosphate levds. Patients often complain of a variety of \nconstitutional symptoms secondary to their kidney disease, includ-\ning fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and pruritus. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Pathophysiology \n1. Each day, ingested nonvolatile acids neutralize HCO,-. \n2. In health, the kidneys regenerate the HCQ3- and maintain \nthe acid-base equilibrium. \n3. Kidney impairment results in failed HCO,- regeneration \nand a metabolic acidosis. \nB. Acidosis in patients with kidney disease may be of the anion \ngap type or nonanion gap type. \n1. In early kidney disease, ammonia-genesis is impaired, \nresulting in reduced acid secretion and a nonanion gap \nmetabolic acidosis. \n2. In more advanced chronic kidney disease, the kidney \nremains unable to excrete the daily acid load and also \nbecomes unable to excrete anions such as sulfutes, \nphosphates, and urate. Therefore, an anion gap acidosis \ndevelops. HC03- levels stabilize between 12 mEq/L and \n20 mEq/L. \nC. The acidosis has several adverse effects. \n1. Increased calcium loss from bone \n2. Increased skeletal muscle breakdown \nTreatment \nA. NalICO,- replacement \nB. Hemodialysis \nAlternative Diagnosis: Starvation Ketosis \nTypically, starvation ketosis occurs in patients with diminished car-\nbohydrate intake. Ketosis is usually mild (HCQ3-\n~ 14 mEq/L) \nand serum glucose is usually normal. Serum pH is usually normal. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Alcoholic Ketoacidosis \nAlcoholic ketoacidosis usually occurs in advanced alcoholism \nwhen the majority of calories come from alcohol. Ketoacidosis \ndevelops due to the combined effects of inadequate carbohydrate \nintake, ethanol conversion to acetic acid and stimulated lipolysis. \nKetoacidosis may be precipitated by decreased intake, pancreatitis, \ngastrointestinal bleeding, or infection and may be profound. The \nplasma glucose level is typically normal to low. (Significant eleva-\ntions suggest concomitant DKA.) It is imponant to consider other \n\n64 I CHAPTER 4 \ncauses of metabolic acidosis in alcoholic patients with acidosis. \nFirst, patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis often have concomitant \nlactic acidosis. Shock and hypoxia should be carefully considered. \nLactic acidosis may also occur due to an increase in NADH levels \nand can be particularly severe in patients with thiamine deficiency. \nSecond, toxic ingestions (methanol, ethylene glycol, or salicy-\nlate) should also be considered, especially in patients with a large \nosmolar gap. (The osmolar gap = measured serum osmolality -\ncalculated serum osmolality. The calculated osmolality = (2 x \nNa)+ Glucose (mg/dL)/18 +BUN (mg/dL)/2.8) + ETOH (mg/ \ndL)/3.7. A normal osmolar gap< 10 mOsm/kg.) The treatment \nfor alcoholic ketoacidosis should include N thiamine prior to \nN glucose to avoid precipitating Wernicke encephalopathy or \nKorsakoff syndrome. \n\nMr. L's serum ketones are large. He denies any history \nof heavy alcohol use or al7use. The serum lactate level is \n1 mEqlL (nl 0.5-1.5 mEqlL). \nStep 5: Diagnose Primary Disorder \nThe high serum ketones confirm ketoacidosis as the primary meta-\nbolic disturbance and the high glucose and diabetic history clearly \nsuggest OKA as the cause of the primary acid-base abnormality. \nThe high glucose and profound acidosis are not consistent with \nstarvation ketoacidosis and the absence of a significant alcohol \nhistory argues against alcoholic ketoacidosis. The normal lactate \neffectively rules out lactic acidosis, and uremic acidosis is very \nunlikely with mild kidney disease (creatinine = 1.8). \nStep 6: Check for Additional Disorders \nStep 6A: Check Anion Gap \nAlready completed (see above) \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMs. 5 Is a 32-year-old woman who complalns of nausea \nand vomiting. She reports that she felt well until 5 days \nago when she noticed urinary frequency and bumlng on \nurination. She increased her intake of fluids and cranberry \njuice but noticed some increasing right back pain 2 days \nago. Yesterday, she felt warm and noticed that she had \na fever of 38.8C and teeth-chattering chllls. Subse-\nquently, she has been unable to keep down any food or \nliquids and has persistent nausea and vomiting. She feels \nweak and dizzy. Physical exam: supine BP. 95/62 mm Hg; \npulse, 120 bpm; temperature, 38.9C; RR. 24 breaths per \nminute. On standing, her BP fa[l5 to 72/40 mm Hg with a \npulse of 145 bpm. Cardiac and pulmonary exams are nota-\nble only for the tachycardia. She has 2+ right costover-\ntebral angle tenderness. Abdominal exam is soft without \nStep 68: Calculate Whether Compensation \nIs Appropriate \nAs shown in Table 4-4 the expected drop in PaCO to compensate for \na metabolic acidosis is 1.2 mm Hg per 1 mEq/L tall in HCO,-. The \npatient's H CO 3 - is 6 mEq/L (nl is 24 mEq/L), which is an 18 mEq/L \ndecrement. The PaC02 shouldfullby1.2 x 18 = 21.6 mm Hg. Since \nthe normal PaC02 is approximately 40 mm Hg, the PaC02 would \nbe expected to be approximately 40 - 21.6\"' 18. The actual PaC02 \n(20 mm Hg) is close to this predicted value suggesting that respira-\ntory compensation is indeed appropriate. \nStep 7: Reach Final Diagnosis \nTherefore, Mr. L is suffering from an anion gap metabolic acidosis \nsecondary to OKA with appropriate respiratory compensation. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nEvaluation and treatment identify the precipitant of OKA and \ntreats the acidosis, hyperglycemia, and profound dehydration. \n\nMr. L confirms he has been taking his Insulin. He reports no \nfever, rlgors, dysuria, cough, shortness of breath, dlarrhea, \nor abdominal pain. Urinalysis, chest radiograph. and lipase \nwere sent to search for t he precipit ating event. All of t he \nresults were normal. An ECG revealed T wave Inversion In \nleads V1 -V4, suggesting anterior myocardial lschemia. \nTroponln T levels were elevated consistent with an acute \nMl (believed to be the precipitant of his DKA). He was \ntransferred to the ICU for monitoring. He received fluid \nresuscitation, IV insulin until his ketoacldosis resolved, and \nsupplemental potassium (when his potassium fell belo\n5.3 mEq/L). His Ml was t reated with beta-blockers and \naspirin. Subsequent cardiac catheterlzatlon revealed t riple \nvessel disease. After stablllzatlon, he underwent coronary \nartery bypass grafting and did well. \nrebound, guarding, or focal tenderness. Initial laboratory \nresults include Na+, 138 mEq/L; K+, 3.8 mEq/L; HC0\n15~. \n14 mEq/L; c1-, 1 02 mEq!L; BUN, 30 mg/dL; creatinine, \n1.2 mg/dL; glucose, 90 mg/dL. \nThe list of symptoms and signs can be grouped together to make \nevaluation more organized: (1) dysuria, urinary frequency, flank \npain, fever, and chills, (2) nausea and vomiting, (3) hypotension \nand tachycardia, and (4) loserum HCO,-. In addition to inves-\ntigating the probable urinary tract infection, it is critical to deter-\nmine the nature of the acid-base abnormality. \nAt thi9 point, what i9 th\" l\"ading hYf\"\"thsei9, \nwhat are the active alternative&, and 15 \nthere a muet not ml95 dlagno9i91 Given thle \ndiffersntlal diagnoeie, what tel!ltl!I should bs \nordsred1 \n\nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nStep 1: Determine Whether the Primary \nDisorder Is an Acidosis or Alkalosis by \nReviewing the pH \nSimilar to the first case, Ms. S has a loserum HC03- suggest-\ning a metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, it is conceivable (but \nunlikely), that the loserum HC03- could occur in compensation \nfor a profound respiratory alkalosis. An ABG can determine the \nprimary disorder and assess compensation. \n\nAn ABG reveals a pH of 7.29. PaC02 of 30 mm Hg. Pa02 of \n90mmHg. \nThe lopH on the ABG confirms the primary process is an \nacidosis. \nStep 2: Determine Whether the Primary \nAcidosis or Alkalosis is Metabolic or \nRespiratory by Reviewing the HC03 -\nandPaC02 \nMs. S's serum HCQ3- is 14 mEq/L, her PaC02 is 30 mm Hg.

Her anion gap= 138 - (102 + 14) = 22. \nTable 4-7. Diagnostic hypotheses for Ms. S. \nACID-BASE ABNORMALITIES I 65 \nClearly, Ms. S is suffering from an anion gap metabolic acidosis. \nThis is alarming because metabolic acidosis in the face of infection \nsuggests lactic acidosis due to severe sepsis. \nStep 4: Explore the Differential Diagnoses \nof the Primary Disorder \nThe leading and must not miss hypothesis would clearly be lactic \nacidosis, especially given the patient's hypotension. If confirmed, \nthe cause of the lactic acidosis must be determined (which would \nmost likely be sepsis for Ms. S) and then treated. Although unlikely, \nalternative causes of an anion gap metabolic acidosis (Table 4-1) \nthat would be reasonable to consider include alcoholic ketoacidosis \nand toxin-related acidosis (including salicylates}. The normal glu-\ncose and lack of history of diabetes rules out OKA, and the severity \nof acidosis is not consistent with starvation ketoacidosis. The nor-\nmal creatinine rules out uremic acidosis. The differential diagnosis \nfor Ms. Sis listed in Table 4-7. \nThe patient denies any history of alcohol use, moonshine or \nantifreeze ingestion, or unusual salicylate use. Further lab \nstudies Include WBC. 18.500 cells/mcL with 62% granu-\nlocytes and 30% bands. Urlnalysls reveals> 20 WBC/hpf. \nMs. S's history does not suggest toxic ingestions and her his-\ntory of fever, dysuria, and flank pain as well as leukocytosis and \npyuria, clearly suggest urinary tract infection and pydonephritis. \nHer teeth-chattering chills suggest bacteremia, which combined \nwith her hypotension suggests sepsis. Sepsis can cause lactic acid \nproduction and thereby generate an anion gap metabolic acidosis. \n~ \nle the cllnfc:al lnformatlon eufflclant to make a \n1~ r \ndlagnoele?

The most common causes arc hypoxcmia, septic shock, \ncardiogcnic shock, or hypovolcmic shock. Patients with shock usu-\nally have hypotcnsion and tachycardia and often have impaired \nmcntation and decreased urinary output. Patients with septir: shock \ntypically have fever and tachypnea. While patients with cardiogenic \nor hemorrhagic shock often have cold extremities, patients with \nseptic shock often have warm extremities and bounding pulses \nafter fluid resuscitation. (Pulses are bounding due to a widened \npulse pressure.) See Chapter 25 for a revieof sepsis. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Most common cause of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized \nadults \nB. The most common causes oflactic acidosis arc due to inade-\nquate tissue oxygenation. This results in anaerobic metabolism \nand the production of lactic acid. Therefore, the differential \ndiagnosis can be remembered by tracing the pathway of \noxygen all the way from the environment through the blood \nto the cells and mitochondria. Any disease that interferes with \noxygen delivery can cause lactic acidosis (Table 4-8). \nI. Looxygen carrying capacity \na. Hypoxemia (from pulmonary or cardiac disease) \nb. Severe anemia \nc. Carbon monoxide poisoning (interferes with oxygen \nbinding) \nd. Methemoglobinemia \nTable 4-8.

Malignancy \nc. Thiamine deficiency \nd. Certain medications (nucleoside reverse transcriptase \ninhibitors, linezolid, propofol, and beta-agonists.) \n6. Metformin may cause lactic acidosis. \na. Risk factors include concomitant chronic kidney \ndisease, liver disease, heart failure (HF), alcohol use, \nacute illness, and IV radiocontrast administration. \nb. Current recommendations suggest the following: \n(1) For patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \nof 30-45 mUmin: \n(a) Do not start mctformin \n(b) Reduce dose by 50% in patients already \ntolerating metformin \n(2) For patients with a GFR < 30 mUmin, metformin \nshould not be used. \n(3) Mctformin should be hdd for 48 hours beginning \nat the time of administration of IV radiocontrast \nagents. \nC. Lactate elevation is associated with a substantially increased \nmortality in multiple clinical scenarios including sepsis, car-\ndiogenic shock, trauma, pulmonary embolism, and burns. The \nmortality rate of patients with shock and lactic acidosis is 70% \ncompared with 25-35% in patients with shock without lactic \nacidosis. \nD. Lactate levels can serve to risk stratify patients with suspected \ninfection, even among those without apparent shock, presum-\nably due to the identification of undetected hypopcrfusion. The \nmortality in normotensivc patients (systolic BP ~ 90 mm Hg) \nwith suspected infection and a lactate level:<!: 4.0 was 15% vs. \n2.5% in those with lactate levels< 4.0 mmol/L. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Scrum lactate levels are the gold standard and more sensitive \nand spcciflc than an increase in the anion gap. \nB. An elevated anion gap is 44-67% sensitive for lactic acidosis \nC. An elevated anion gap may suggest lactic acidosis, but a \nnormal anion gap docs not exclude lactic acidosis. \nTreatment \nThe serum lactate level should be measured \nin critically ill patients in whom shock is \nsuspected regardless of the anion gap. \nA. Treatment of lactic acidosis should target the underlying \ncondition. \n\nB. Buffering agents such as NaH CO 3 - do not improve hemody-\nnamics or survival in patients witli a pH of> 7 .1.

The clinical sce-\nnario and positive cultures strongly suggest that the diagnosis is \nlactic acidosis secondary to sepsis. Other tests are not necessary to \nconfirm the diagnosis. \nStep 6: Check for Additional Disorders \nStep 6A: Check Anion Gap \nAlready completed (see above). \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. Risa 55-year-old man with chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease (COPD) with a chief complaint of dyspnea. \nHe reports that symptoms began 5 days ago with a cough \nproduc;t;lve of green sputum. The cough worsened. and \n4 days a() he had a low-grade fever of 37.2C. He noticed \nIncreasing shortness of breath 3 days a{lO. He reports that \npreviously he was able to walk about 25 feet before becom-\ning short of breath but nohe is short of breath at rest. \nLast night his fever reached 38.8\"C. and today his dyspnea \nIntensified. He Is unable to complete a sentence without \npausing to take a breath. On physical exam, he appears older \nthan his stated age. He is gaunt. sitting upright. breath-\ning through pursed lips. and in obvious distress. Vital signs \nare temperature, 38.S\"C; RR. 28 breaths per minute; BP. \n110170 mm Hg; pulse, 110 bpm. His pulsus paradox Is \n20 mm Hg. Lung exam reveals signlflcant use of accessory \nmuscles and markedly decreased breath sounds. Cardiac \nexam is notable only for diminished heart sounds. \nACID-BASE ABNORMALITIES I 67 \nStep 68: Calculate Whether Compensation \nis Appropriate \nIn a metabolic aci~osis , the PaCOLis expected to fall br 1.2 mm Hg \nper 1 mEq/L fall m Hco,- (see lable 4-4}. The pattent's HCO -\nis 14 mEq/L (10 mEq/L belonormal). The PaC02 should f.Ji \nby 1.2 x 10 = 12. Since normal Pa CO 2 is approximately 40 mm Hg, \nwe would expect the PaC02 to be approximately 28 mm Hg \n(40 - 12 = 28 mm Hg). The actual PaC02 is 30 mm Hg, quite \nclose to the prediction. This suggests that respiratory compensa-\ntion is appropriate. \nStep 7: Reach Final Diagnosis \nIn summary, Ms. S is suffering from a lactic acidosis with appropri-\nate respiratory compensation. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMs. S was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and \nIV fluid resuscitation. After init ial stabilization. hypotension \nrecurred and urinary output dropped. She was transferred \nto the ICU. Four hours later her oxygenation deteriorated \nand a chest film revealed a diffuse Infiltrate consistent \nwith acute respiratory dist ress syndrome. She was intu-\nbated and given IV fluids. norepinephrine. antibiotics. \nand mechanical ventilation. Over t he next 24 hours. her \nBP stablllzed and her anion gap lac;t;lc acidosis resolved. \nSeventy-two hours later she was extubated. She eventu-\nally made a full recovery. \nYout resident is concerned about the adequacy of Mr. R.'s venti-\nlation and suggests checking his pulse oximetry. You remind him \nthat a pulse oximeter will not address the adequacy of the patient's \nventilation nor will it determine whether respiratory failure is pres-\nent and suggest an ABG. \n\nAnABG reveals a pHof7.22, PaC0 2 of 70mm Hg, and Pa02 \nof55 mm Hg. \nAlways check an ABG when the adequacy of a \npatient's ventilation is a concern. Patients with \nadequate oxygenation may still be in respira-\ntory failute. \nClearly, Mr. R has several problems that are easily identified, \nincluding (1) fever, cough, and history of COPD; (2) respiratory \ndistress; and (3) acidosis. All of these problems are obviously \npotentially life-threatening. Furthermore, a thorough evalua-\ntion of the acidosis may shed light on the status of the other \nproblems. \n\n68 I CHAPTER 4 \nAt thl5 point, what le the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the aGtlve altematlve9, and 19 \nthere a must not ml55 diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential c:liagnoeie, what teete ehould 17s \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nStep 1: Determine Whether the Primary \nDisorder is an Acidosis or Alkalosis by \nReviewing the pH \nThe lopH confirms the primary disorder is an acidosis. \nStep 2: Determine Whether the Primary Acidosis \nor Alkalosis is Metabolic or Respiratory by \nReviewing the HC03 - and PaC02 \n\nPaC02 of70 mm Hg; Na. 138 mEqlL; K+. 5.1 mEqlL; HCOll-. \n27 mEq!L; c1-. 102 mEq!L; BUN, 30 mg/dL; creatlnlne, \n1.2 mg/dl. \n\nThe PaC02 and HCO,- are both elevated. An elevated PaC02 \nwould lower pH and cause an acidemia (whereas an elevated \nHCO ll - would ea use a Ilea I em ia). Since the patient is acidem ic, \nthe primary process Is a re5plratory acidosis. \nStep 3: Narrothe Differential Diagnoses \nof Metabolic Acidosis by Calculating the \nAnion Gap \nThis step is not relevant to this patient with a HC03- of27 mEq/L \narguing against a metabolic acidosis. (This is supported by the nor-\nmal anion gap.) \nStep 4: Explore the Differential Diagnoses of \nthe Primary Disorder \nRespiratory acidosis may be caused by pulmonary diseases and a \nvariety of neuromuscular diseases (see Table 4-1). His prior history \nof COPD and acute pulmonary complaints of cough and fever \nclearly suggest that his respiratory acidosis is due to a pulmonary \nprocess. Specifically, Mr. R's history of very poor exercise tolerance \nat ha.reline suggests severe COPD. Such severe COPD could result \nin chronic carbon dioxide retention and chronic respiratory acidosis. \nAlternatively, a \"must not miss\" possibility is that his acute respira-\ntory infection has precipitated acute respiratory failure (and acute \nrespiratory acidosis). This is suggested by his worsening symptoms, \nrespiratory distress, upright poscure, pursed lip breathing, pulsus \nparadox, and decreased breath sounds. It is critical to distinguish \nacute respiratory acidosis from chronic respiratory acitlosis because the \nformer is more likely to progress rapidly to complete respiratory \nfailure and respiratory arrest. Therefore, acute respiratory acidosis \nis both the leading hypothesis and the \"must not miss\" diagnosis. \nTable 4-9 ranks the differential diagnosis considering the available \ndemographic information, risk factors, symptoms and signs. \nTable~.

Such patients are at \ngreater risk for respiratory failure. \nLeading Hypothesis: Respiratory Acidosis \nTatbook Presentation \nThe presentation of respiratory acidosis depends primarily on the \nunderlying cause. The most common causes are severe underly-\ning lung disease (eg, COPD, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema) \nand such patients are in respiratory distress. Respiratory acidosis \nmay also present as altered mental status in patients with advanced \nrespiratory failure and in those in whom the respiratory failure is \ndue to CNS disorders (ie, intoxication.) \nDisease Highlights \nA. Insufficient ventilation results in increasing levels of PaC02 \nThis in curn lowers arterial pH. Renal compensation occurs \nover several days, with increased renal H CO 3 - regeneration. \nB. Ventilation is assessed by measuring the arterial PaC02 and \npH. Significant hypoventilation and acidosis may occur \nwithout significant hypoxia. \nC. Etiology: Although most commonly due to lung disease, \nrespiratory acidosis may result from any disease affecting \nventilation-from the brain to the alveoli (eg, narcotic \noverdose is an unfortunately common cause of respiratory \nfailure and death. See differential diagnosis of acid-base \ndisorders in Table 4-1.) \nD. Manifestations are due to the primary disorder and the effects \nofhypercarbia on the CNS. \n\n1. Patients are typkally quite dyspnek, in distress, sitting \nupright, leaning forward, and anxious. The cardiac and \npulmonary findings depend on the underlying etiology. \n2. CNS manifestations \na. Severity depends on acuity. Patients with chronic \nhypercapnia have markedly fewer CNS effects than \npatients with acute hypercapnia. \nb. Anxiety, irritability, confusion, and lethargy may be seen. \nc. Headache may be prominent in the morning due to \nthe worsening hypoventilation that occurs with sleep \ncausing vasodilatation and increasing intracranial \npressure. \nd. Stupor and coma may occur when the PaC02 is \n> 70-100 mm Hg. \ne. Tremor, asterixis, slurred speech, and papilledema may \nbe seen. \nEvidence-Based. Diagnosis \nA. Since respiratory failure can be an indication for emergent \nmechanical ventilatory support, clinicians should have a lo\nthreshold for checking an ABG to obtain the PaCO 2 This \nincludes patients with respiratory distress, mental status \nchanges, and hypersomnolence. \nB. Respiratory failure is typically characterized by PaC02 \n> 45 mm Hg, causing a respiratory acidosis. \nC. However, occasionally, a normalPaC02 also suggests \nrespiratory failure. \n1. For example, during asthma attacks, patients typically \nhyperventilate and present with a PaC02 belonormal. \nA normal PaCO~ in such a patient may reflect respiratory \nfatigue and herald the devdopment of frank respiratory \nfailure. \n2. Patients with primary metabolic acidoses typically \nhyperventilate to compensate, lowering the PaC02 bdo\nnormal. \na. A PaC02 of~ 40 mm Hg is inappropriate in such cases \nand suggests respiratory failure. \nb. Inability to compensate (hyperventilate) during a \nmetabolic acidosis is associated with an increased risk of \nrequiring mechanical ventilation. \nD. Pulsus paradox is an objective marker of severe respiratory \ndistress. \n1. Defined as > 10 mm Hg drop in systolic BP during \ninspiration \n2. May be seen in patients using unusually strong inspiratory \neffort due to asthma, COPD, or other respiratory diseases \n3. The fall in systolic BP during inspiration is caused by \nan exaggerated inspiratory effort, which increases the \nnegative inspiratory intrathoracic pressure and augmenu \nvenous return. This results in excessive RV filling causing \nthe interventricular septum to bulge into the LY, limiting \nLY filling, LY cardiac output, and systolic BP. \n4, When elevated in patients with asthma, it is highly specific \nfor a severe attack but has poor sensitivity (Table 4-10). \nTreatment \nA. Identify and treat underlying disease process (ie, bronchodila-\ntors for asthma, naloxone for narcotic overdose). \nB. Supplemental oxygen should be given as necessary to prevent \nhypoxemia. \nACID-BASE ABNORMALITIES I 69 \nTable4-10.

Mechanical ventilation with either intubation or biphasic \npositive airway pressure (BiPAP) is lifesaving in many patients. \n1. Institution of mechanical ventilation is considered when \npH< 7.1-7.25 or PaC02 > 80-90 mm Hg or when \nindicated by patient symptoms. \n2. In general, patients with chronic hypoventilation tolerate \nhypercapnia better than patients with acute hypercapnia. \nD. Avoid hypokalemia and dehydration that may worsen meta-\nbolic alkalosis, raise the serum pH, and inadvertently further \nsuppress ventilation. \nStep 5: Diagnose Primary Disorder \nThe patient's clinical picture and ABG clearly suggest the pri-\nmary disorder is a respiratory acidosis. However, to diagnose the \nprimary disorder, it is critical to distinguish whether this is an \nacute or chronic respiratory acidosis. Acute respiratory acidosis can \nbe distinguished from chronic respiratory acidosis by evaluating \nthe degree of metabolic compensation (provided there are no other \nacidoses also effecting HC03-). Chronic respiratory acidoses are \nassociated with more complete compensation (and higher HCO,-\nlevels), than acute respiratory acidoses (because metabolic compen-\nsation takes time). Table 4-4 shows the formulas that can be used \nto calculate the HCO,- levels. In acute respiratory acidosis, the \nHCO,- increases by only 1 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg increase \nin PaC0\n41 whereas in chronic respiratory acidosis, the HCO,-\nincreases by 4 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg increase in PaC02 In \nMr. R's case, the PaC02 is 70 mm Hg, up by 30 mm Hg (from a \nnormal of 40 mm Hg), so if this were an acute respiratory acidosis, \nthe HC03- level would be expected to increase by only 3 mEq/L \n(from a normal of24 mEq/L to 27 mEq/L). If, on the other hand, \nthis is a chronic respiratory acidosis, an increase of 4 mEq/L of \nHCO,- per 10 mm Hg increase in PaCOi would be expected. For \na 30 mm Hg increase in PaC02, the predicted increase in HC03-\nwould be 3 x 4 = 12 mEq/L increasing the serum HC03- to 36 \n(24 + 12 mEq/L). Since Mr. R.'s HCO,- is 27 mEq/L, an increase \nof only 3 mEq/L from a normal baseline of 24 mEq/L, the primary \ndisorder is an acute respiratory acidosis, an alarming diagnosis. \nStep 6: Check for Additional Disorders \nStep 6A: Calculate Anion Gap (Even in Patients \nWithout Acidosis) to Uncover Unexpected \nAnion Gap Metabolic Acidosis \nAnother \"must not miss\" diagnosis for Mr. R would be sepsis. \nHis symptoms of fever and cough suggest the possibility of \npneumonia, which can be complicated by sepsis resulting in an \nanion gap metabolic lactic acidosis. Although his elevated H CO 3 -\ndoes not immediately suggest a metabolic acidosis from sepsis, \n\n70 I CHAPTER 4 \nthe HCQ3- may not be loif there is also a superimposed met-\nabolic allcalosis generating HCO,-. These hidden acidoses can \nbe discovered by evaluating the anion gap (which is usually de-\nvated in patients with lactic acidosis) or by measuring the serum \nlactate level. \n\nThe anion gap \"\" 138 - (102 + 27) \"\" 9, and the 5erum \nlactate level 15 0.8 mEq!L (nl 0.5-1.5 mEq!L). \nMr. R has a normal anion gap and normal lactate levd, ruling \nout a coexistent hidden anion gap metabolic acidosis from sepsis. \n\nMr. R'5 other laboratory re5ult5 Include a WBC, 16,500/mcL \nwith 62% granulocytee; and 10% bande;. Chee;t radio-\ngraph reveal5 hyperinflated lung field5 and a left lower lobe \ninfiltrate. \nStep 7: Reach Final Diagnosis \nAli noted above, the minimal metabolic compensation suggests that \nMr. R is suffering from an acuu respiratory acidosis with meta-\nbolic compensation. There is no evidence of a hidden anion gap \nacidosis. Therefore, Mr. R has an acute respiratory acidosis caused \nby pneumonia and COPD. He is at significant risk for complete \nrespiratory failure and he is transferred to the ICU. \n~ \nIt is vital to distinguish acute from chronic \ny \nrespiratory acidoses. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nIn the ICU, Mr. R 15 placed on ventllatory e;upport with \nBiPAP and antil7iotic5. Over the next 5 day5, hi5 pneumonia \nimprove5. On day 8, BIPAP i5 discontinued and he 15 5ent to \nthe medical floor5. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nRenal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) \nTextbook Presentation \nAlthough there are a variety of RTAs, the most common type in \nadults is type N RTA, caused most commonly by long-standing \ndiabetes. Laboratory abnormalities include mild kidney dis-\nease, a mild nonanion gap acidosis (HCO,-\"' 17 mEq/L} and \nhypcrkalemia. Only the highlights of type IV RTA will be \nreviewed here. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Patients with type N RTA have hypoaldosteronism. \nB. Hypoaldosteronism decreases potassium and H+ excretion, \nresulting in hyperkalemia and acidosis. \nC. The hyperkalemia also interferes with ammonia production \n(the major renal buffer) and further impairs acid secretion. \nThe inability to excrete the daily acid load causes a nonanion \ngap acidosis. \nD. In patients with diabetes mellitus, type N RTA is also \nassociated with lorenin levels. \nE. Etiologies of type N RTA are numerous. \n1. Diabetes with mild kidney disease is the most common. \n2. Other causes include \nL Drugs \n(1) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(2) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors \n(3) Angiotensin receptor blockers \n(4) Potassium-sparing diuretics \n(5) Trimethoprim \n(6) Heparin \n(7) Cyclosporine \nb. Addison disease \nc. Systemic lupus erythematosus \nd. AIDS nephropathy \ne. Chronic interstitial kidney disease \nTreatment \nDietary potassium restriction, loop diuretics, and fludrocortisone \nare useful. \nMetabolic Alkalosis \nTatbook Presentation \nThe most common clinical situations that give rise to a metabolic \nalkalosis are recurrent vomiting or diuretic treatment. The met-\nabolic alkalosis per sc is usually asymptomatic. Muscle cramping \ndue to coexistent hypokalemia may be seen. \nDisease Hi.ghligb.ts \nA. Metabolic alkalosis develops only when there is both a source \nof additional HC03- anti a renal stimulus that limits its \nexcretion. \n1. Increased HCO 3 - production devdops when H  is lost \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract (eg, due to vomiting) \nor (2) lose from the genitourinary tract (eg, due to \nhyperaldosteronism) or (3) during administration of \nHCO..J-. Volume contrac.tion around a constant amount \nofHc03- also serves to mcrease the HCO,-. \n2. Decreased HCO,- excretion is most commonly caused by \ndecreased renal perfusion. This occurs when the effective \ncirculating volume is reduced. \na. Examples include dehydration or other pathologic \nstates associated with decreased renal perfusion \n(ie, HF, nephrotic syndrome). \nb. The mechanisms that interfere with HC03-\nexcretion arc complex but include enhanced \nrenal HCO,- reabsorption and decreased renal \nHCO,- secretion. \n(1) Decreased effective circulating volume promotes \navid Na absorption in the proximal tubule, which \nin turn facilitates HCO,- reclamation (Figure 4-3). \n(2) Decreased effective circulating volume and \nCl-depletion also decrease HC03- secretion by the \n\nBlood \nPCT \nRenal tubule \nHC03 \nNa+ \nNa+ \n~ ) \nHC03 \nHC03 \nH+ \n'/ \nH2C03 \nH2C03 \nt \nt \n002 +~0 \nC02 +H20 \nFigure 4-3. Reabsorption of HCQ3- in hypovolemia. Hypovolemia \nincreases reabsorption of sodium in exchange for hydrogen \nion atthe proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). The hydrogen ion \nreacts with HC03 - eventually forming C02 which crosses the \ncell membrane. HC03 - is then regenerated and delivered to the \nbloodstream. \ncollecting cells, which compounds the metabolic \nalkalosis. This devdops because HCO,- secretion \noccurs in exchange with a- reabsorption in the \ndistal tubules (Figure 4-4). This requires Cl- delivery \nto the collecting tubules, which decreases both \ndue to enhanced proximal Cl- reabsorption and \ngastrointestinal or diuretic-induced Cl- losses. \n(3) Decreased effective circulating volume results in \nsecondary hyperaldosteronism, which activates H \nsecretion by the collecting tubule cdls increasing \nHCO,- production which is reabsorbed into the \nblood. \n(4) Lotubular Cl- also draws chloride into the \ntubular cells (from the plasma) and promotes \nHCO,- reabsorption. \n(5) Hypokalemia is an important mechanism that \npromotes HCO - reabsorption. In the collecting \ntubule, it stimJates potassium reabsorption in \nexchange for H secretion. HCO,- is produced \nand reabsorbed into the blood. \nBlood \nCollecting \ntubule cell \nRenal tubule \nFigure 4-4. Chloride depletion interferes with HCQ3- secretion. \nDistal HCQ3- secretion is facilitated byc1- delivery. Hypovolemia \nincreases proximal NaCl reabsorption, limiting distal chloride \ndelivery, in turn interfering with HC03 - secretion. \nACID-BASE ABNORMALITIES I 71 \nB. Pathologic states associated with metabolic alkalosis \n(Table 4-1) \n1. Vomiting or nasogastric drainage. Pathophysiology: \na. Gastric acid production (and secretion) is matched \nby HC03.- production. The H ion enters the gastric \nlumen, whereas the HC03- enters the blood.scream. \nb. Dehydration decreases renal HC03- excretion \n(see above). \n2. Dehydration or other causes of reduced GFR \n(ie, HF, nephrotic syndrome) \n3. Diuretics \n4. Hypokalemia \n5. Hyperaldosteronism \na. Adrenal adenoma \nb. Licorice ingestion or chewing tobacco (Normally, a renal \nenzyme converts cortisol to cortisone in order to prevent \ncortisol from exerting a significant mineralocorticoid \neffect. Licorice contains the steroid glycyrrhetinic add, \nwhich blocks this enzyme resulting in a heightened \nmineralocorticoid effect from endogenous cortisol.) \n6. Bartter or Gitelman syndromes \n7. Respiratory acidosis also promotes a compensatory \nmetabolic alkalosis. Occasionally, rapid resolution of \nthe respiratory failure will correct the hypercapnia, \nresulting in a transient inappropriate metabolic alkalosis \n(posthypercapnic metabolic alkalosis). \n8. Milk-alkali syndrome \nTreatment \nA. Volume resuscitation with NaCl in patients with true volume \ndepletion usually results in resolution. \nB. Replete potassium deficiency. \nC. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and lobicarbonate dialysis \ncan be used in severe cases, particularly in patients with HF \n(and ineffective circulating volume) who cannot tolerate \nNaCL \nRespiratory Alkalosis \nTextbook Presentation \nThe presentation of respiratory alkalosis depends on the underly-\ning disorder. Most causes are associated with tachypnea, which can \nbe dramatic or subtle. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Hyperventilation induces hypocapnia causing respiratory \nalkalosis. \nB. The most common causes are pulmonary diseases, cirrhosis, \nfever, pain, or anxiety (Table 4-1). \nC. Hypocapnia acutdy reduces CNS blood flow. \nD. Symptoms include paresthesias (particularly perioral), vertigo, \ndizziness, anxiety, hallucinations, myalgias, and symptoms \nreflective of the underlying disorder. \nE. Adverse effects include hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, lung \ninjury, seizures, angina, and arrhythmias. \nTreatment \nTherapy is directed at the underlying disorder. \n\n72 I CHAPTER 4 \nMixed Disorders and the \n11Delta-Delta Gap\" \nA. Occasionally, 2 distinct metabolic processes will be present \nin the same patient (eg, 2 distinct acidoses, 1 anion gap \nand 1 nonanion gap). Alternatively, a patient may have \nboth a metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis (eg, \nmetabolic alkalosis develops in a patient with vomiting and \ndehydration; if these symptoms are prolonged sufficiently, \nsevere dehydration, hypovolemic shock, and lactic acidosis \nalso develop}. \nB. These multiple metabolic processes can be difficult to tease \nout. \nC. One approach to this problem is to evaluate the ddta-ddta \ngap. Here the relative rise in the anion gap over and above \nthe normal anion gap, (MG, the flrst delta} is compared \nwith the absolute fall in HC03- (.ti.HC03-, the second \ndelta.2). \n1. In simple anion gap acidoses, the deltas are similar \n(as patients create extra anions (ie, ketones} increasing \nthe anion gap, the serum HCO,- is neutralized in equal \nproportions). \n2. On the other hand, in a patient with both an anion gap \nand nonanion gap acidoses, the fall in HC03- will be \ngteater than the rise in the anion gap. \n3. In patients with an anion gap acidosis and a metabolic \nalkalosis, the fall in HCO - will be antagonized by the \nconcomitant metabolic albiosis whereas the anions will \nstill accumulate. Therefore, the fall in HCO,- is less than \nthe increase in the anion gap. \nD. While occasionally useful, there are several limitations to \napplying the delta-delta gap. \n1. The normal anion gap varies from institution to institution \nand with the patient's serum albumin. \n2. Even in simple anion gap acidosis, bone buffering of acid \nand renal excretion of anions complicate the delta-delta gap \nand make it difficult to interpret. \nE. In simple anion gap acidosis (without concomitant metabolic \nalkalosis or nonanion gap acidosis) the typical MG/.ti.HC03-\nis 1.6: 1 in lactic acidosis and 1: 1 in ketoacidosis. \n2 MG= Patients anion gap-normal anion gap; f!.HCO~- = 24 - patients' \nHCO; \nREFERENCES \nAnderson LW, Mackenhauer J, Roberts JC, Berg KM, Cocchi MN, Donnino Mw. \nEtiology and therapeutic approach to elevated lactate levels. 2013.

Hodo I diagnose or exclude \nHIV infection? \nJean Luc Benoit, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. A asks his neprimary care clinician whether he should \nget an HIV test. He states that he has \"absolutely no risk \nfactors for HIV.\" and is a very healthy 21-year-old black \nman In a monogamous relationship with his girlfriend for \n2 years. The girlfriend was tested for HIV 6 months ago \nwhen a Board of Health nurse notified her that she might \nhave been exposed to HIV, and retested 3 months ago. Both \nHIV tests were negative, effectively ruling out HIV infection. \nMr. A first became sexually active at age 1 5. Over the \nlast 6 years, he has had 4 female partners, with a bit of \noverlap between the relationships (he had 2 simultane-\nous partners for about 1 year). He has never had sex with \na male. He uses condoms \"pretty consistently.\" He had \nChlamydia trachomatls urethritis 3 years ago, but no other \nsexually transmitted infections. He has never used injecting \ndrugs, although he smokes marijuana once or twice a week. \nHe stopped drinkitl{I excessively when he met his current \ngirlfriend. He does not recall an episode of mononucleosls-\nllke Illness with fever and lymph node enlargement. His past \nmedical history, revieof systems, and physical exam are \notherwise unremarkable. \n~ \nIs the c::llnlc:al lnfomiatlon &Ufflc::ient to make a \n1~r diagnoeie1 If not, what other information do \nyou nesd1 \nLeading Hypothesis: Undetected HIV infection \nTatbook Presentation \nChronic HIV infection may present in a myriad of ways. Many \npatients are entirely asymptomatic in spite of long-standing HIV \ninfection and advanced immune deficiency as demonstrated by an \nabsolute CD4 T lymphocyre (CD4TI) count belo200 cells/mcL \n(immunologic AIDS). Some patients may have symptoms that are \noften seen with HIV but are nonspecific, such as chronic diarrhea, \nseborrheic dermatitis, multiple molluscum contagiosum, poorly \nresponsive psoriasis, and prurigo nodularis. Other patients have \nconditions that are strongly associated with HIV infection but are \nalso encountered in non-HIV-infected persons, such as ruberculosis \n(TB), idiopathic thrombocyropenic purpura, nephropathy, nonis-\nchemic cardiomyopathy, herpes zoster (shingles), and non-Hodgkin \nlymphoma. Unfortunately, patients may be found to have HIV \nonly when they are admitted to the hospital with a life-threatening \nAIDS-defining condition, such as Pneumocystis jirowcii pneumonia \n(PJP), Cryptococcus neofarmans meningitis, central nervous system \n(CNS) toxoplasmosis, or primary CNS lymphoma (PCL). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Epidemiology of HIV in the United States \n1. Prevalence: At the end of 2016, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that \n1,130,000 persons were living with HIV infection in \nthe United States of whom 973,846 persons had been \ndiagnosed (an 11 % increase over 2011). \n2. Incidence: In 2016, there were 39,782 neHIV diagnoses, \na 5% decrease from 2011. \n3. The prevalence of HIV continues to increase in spite of \nthe decreasing incidence because HIV-infected people live \nlonger than in the past. \n4. The sex ratio of neHIV infections is about 4 males to \n1 female. \n5. Men who have sex with men {MSMs) are \ndisproponionately infected: male-to-male sexual contact \naccounts for 67% of neinfections, heterosexual contact \n24%, and injection drug use (IDU) 6%. About 3% of ne\ninfections are associated with both male-to-male sexual \ncontact and IDU. \n6. Racial and ethnic disparities are significant: blacks account \nfor 44% of neinfections; whites, 26%; Hispanics, 25%; \nand Asians, 2%. \n7. Regional differences are also significant: the rates of ne\nHIV diagnoses per 100,000 population are 16.8 in the \nSouth, 11.2 in the Northeast, 10.2 in the West, and 7.5 in \nthe Midwest. \n8. Transmission \na. Common modes of transmission include male-to-male \nsexual transmission, heterosexual transmission, and drug \nparaphernalia sharing among ID Us. Mother-to-child \ntransmission during pregnancy; perinatally, or through \nbreastfeeding has become uncommon in the United \nStates (but remains common in Africa). \nb. The higher the viral load, the greater the risk of \ntransmission. \n(1) The viral load is high in both acute HIV infection \nand advanced AIDS. \n(2) Coinfections, such as TB or syphilis, increase the \nviral load. \n\n74 I CHAPTER 5 \n(3) Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) results \nin a very loviral load, decreasing the risk of \ntransmission by at least 95%. \nc. Sexual practices and sexually transmitted infections \n(1) The highest risk of sexual transmission is among \nmen with unprotected receptive anal intercourse \nand individuals with multiple sexual partners. \n(2) The presence of genital inflammation or breakdown \nof genital mucosa increases the risk of transmission. \nReceptive anal intercourse is frequently associated \nwith trauma as well as an increased risk of sexually \ntransmitted infections. \n(3) Sexually transmitted infections, whether they cause \ngenital ulceration or not, significantly increase the \nrisk of either transmitting or acquiring HIY. \n(4) The risk is greater for persons with simultaneous \nrather than consecutive parmers. \n(5) During heterosexual intercourse, man-to-woman \ntransmission is significantly more likely than \nwoman-to-man transmission. \n(6) Circumcised males are 65% less likely to acquire HN \nthrough heterosexual intercourse, but circumcision \ndoes not reduce male-to-male sexual transmission. \n(7) The consistent use of barrier methods (either male \nor female condoms) is about 95% effective in \npreventing HN sexual transmission, but adherence \nis poor in most high-risk situations. \nd. Transmission through blood transfusion has been \nnearly eliminated by blood product screening. The risk \nassociated with blood transfusion in the United States is \nestimated at< 1 in 1,800,000 units. \ne. Mother-to-child-transmission is common without ART \nprophylaxis. Effective therapy markedly reduces this risk \n(see below). \nB. HN and its target, the CD4TL \n1. The main target cell ofHN is the CD4TL. The HN \nsurface protein GP 120 binds first to the main HIV \nreceptor, the CD4 receptor. Second, the surface protein \nbinds to an HN chemokine co-receptor, either CCRS or \nCXCR4. HIV also infects secondary target cells that carry \nthese receptors, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and \nstem cells. \n2. HN replicates mostly in activated CD4TL: 99% of \nHN detected in the blood comes from recently infected, \nactivated CD4TL. \n3. In acute HN infection, there is a very rapid decrease in the \nnumber of CD4TL in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues \nbut only a moderate and partially reversible decrease in the \nbloodCD411. \n4. In chronic HN infection, the absolute CD4TL count \ndecreases slowly in the blood. About 2 billion CD411 are \ndestroyed and replaced every day. Both HIV-infected and \nnoninfected CD4TL (innocent bystanders) are destroyed. \n5. In most infected individuals, the high rate of CD411 death \nresults in a progressive fall in the blood CD4TL. \n6. When the absolute CD4TL count falls belo200 cells/mcL, \nimmunologic AIDS is diagnosed. \na. The patient is susceptible to virulent pathogens, \nopportunistic infections (Ols), and AIDS-defining \nmalignancies. The lower the CD411 count, the greater the \nrisk of any 01 and the greater the spectrum ofOis seen. \nb. Some patients acquire an 01 (such as TB) or AIDS-\ndeflning malignancy {such as lymphoma) at a CD411 \nhigher than 200 cells/mcL; in these cases clinical AIDS \nis diagnosed. \n7. About 5% of patients have stable CD4TL over many years \n(\"long-term nonprogressors\"). Rarely, the viral load is also \nundetectable {\"elite controllers\"). \n8. Accelerated evolution of HN and quasi-species \na. HN evolves rapidly due to both a high rate of mutations \nintroduced by an error-prone reverse transcriptase \nand a very high replication rate (10 billion neHN \nvirions per day). This allows for the rapid development \nof genetic variants (quasi-species), which may escape \nimmune responses and become resistant to a number of \nantiretroviral agents. \nb. Effective ART requires complete suppression of viral \nreplication to prevent necell infections and the \nproduction of mutations associated with drug resistance. \nC. Staging \n1. Stages ofHN infection include viral transmission, primary \ninfection, seroconversion, clinically latent period, early \nsymptomatic HN infection, and AIDS. \na. Primary HIV infection \n(1) Most patients with primary HIV infection \nare symptomatic: many have nonspecific \nsymptoms like fever, diarrhea, arthralgia, \nheadache, or flu-like symptoms. Some present \nwith a striking mononucleosis syndrome that \nincludes fever, sore throat, rash, oral aphthous \nulcers, and lymphadenopathy. Occasionally, \nthey have neurologic complications, such as \naseptic meningitis, acute encephalopathy, or \nGuillain-Barre syndrome. \nAcute HIV infection should be considered \nin patients with mononucleosis syndromes \nwhen tests are negative for Epstein-Barr virus \n{negative EBY viral capsid lgM) and cytomeg-\nalovirus (negative CMV IgM). Diagnosis of \nacute HN requires a high index of suspicion. \n(2) In primary HN infection, the HN viral load \nis almost always> 10,000/mcL and usually \n> 100,000/mcL. Therefore, a low-positive viral \nload in this context should be repeated to rule \nout a false-positive test. \nb. Seroconversion \n(1) Seroconversion rapidly causes a full in HIV viral \nload (due to both humoral and cellular immune \nresponses). \n(2) After about 6 months, the viral load is set at a levd \nthat remains relatively stable in any specific patient \n{the viral load \"set point\") but varies from patient to \npatient. \n(3) In the absence of ART, the set point predicts the \nrate of disease progression (higher viral loads are \nassociated with more rapid declines in CD411 \ncounts). \nc. Clinically latent period \n(1) Following primary infection, viral replication \ncontinues primarily within activated CD411, with \nprogressive destruction of the CD4TL pool. \n\n(2) Pe~istent general.W:d lymphadenopathy is often seen. \n(3) Progression to an AIDS-defining illness is more \ncommon in patients with higher viral loads and \nlower CD4TL counts. \n(4) Progressive depletion of CD4TI renders patients \nincreasingly susceptible to Ols and malignancies: \nAIDS is predominantly a T-a:ll immunodeficiency. \nHowever, multiple other immune responses are \nabnormal: for example, HIV-infected patients often \nhave polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and fail \nto mount antibody responses to either Streptococcus \npneumoniae infection or the administration of the \n23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharidc vaccine. \nd. Early symptomatic HN infection: At relatively high \nCD4TI counts (200-350 cclls/mcL) HN infection is \nassociated with an increased risk of infections by virulent \npathogens, especially pneumococcal pneumonia and TB. \ne. AIDS \n(1) Advanced HN disease is accompanied by \nsevere CD4TI depletion (belo200 cclls/mcL) \nand infection with less virulent, opportunistic \npathogens. \n(2) Specific opportunistic pathogens arc mostly \nencountered when the CD4TL count falls beloa \ncritical level. \n(a) CD4TL count< 200 cells/mcL: PJP, oral \ncandidiasis \n(b) CD4TL count < 100 cells/mcL: \nToxoplasma gondii brain abscesses, Canditia \nesophagitis, C neoformans meningitis, \ndisseminated histoplasmosis, and meningeal \ncoccidioidomycosis \n(c) CD4TL count < 50 cclls/mcL: Cytomcgalovir\n(CMV) retinitis and Mycobacterium aviuml \nintrllce//ula\" (MAI); the latter is also called \ndisseminated M avium complex (MAC) \n(3) AIDS diagnostic criteria \n(a) CD4TI count < 200 cells/mcL (immunologic \nAIDS) \n(b) AIDS indicator conditions (clinical AIDS): \n(i) AIDS-defining malignancies: PCL, non-\nHodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and \ninvasive cervical cancer \n(ii) Ols: PJP, TB, disseminated MAC, recurrent \nbacterial pneumonia, esophagcal candidiasis, \ncryptococcosis, progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML}, toxoplasmosis, \nand cryptosporidiosis \n(iii) Other AIDS indicator conditions: HIV-\nassociated dementia and AIDS wasting \nsyndrome (\"slim disease\") \n(c) Advanced HN infection is defined as CD4TL \ncount < 50 cells/mcL. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nSimilar to any other diagnosis, the positive predictive value is \ndetermined by 3 features: the pretest probability of disease, the \nsensitivity of the test, and the specificity of the test. Each feature \nmwt be carefully evaluated to interpret HN results properly. \nA. Estimating pretest probability ofHN infection \n1. Risk facto~ include MSM, IOU, and multiple sexual partne~. \n2. The prevalence of HIV varies from 0.3% in the general US \npopulation to > 50% in very high-risk groups. \nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 75 \nB. Diagnosis ofHN: the 3-step HIV screening sequence \n1. The diagnosis ofHN infection utilizes antibodies to HN \nand tests for HIV RNA and HN p24 antigen. \na. HN RNA and p24 antigen are present prior to HN \nantibodies and allofor the diagnosis of early HIV \ninfection prior to the presence of HIV antibodies \n(Figure 5-1). \nb. The CDC has recently recommended a 3-step HIV \nscreening sequence to improve the sensitivity of early \nHN diagnosis without increasing the rate of false-\npositive diagnosis (Figure 5-2). \n(1) The first step is the fourth-generation HN-1/2 \nantigen/antibody combination immunoassay: it \ndetects both HIV 1/2 antibody (Ah) and HIV-1 \np 24 antigen (Ag). Adding the p24 Ag to this test \nallows for recognition of early HN infection before \nAh is detectable. \n(2) When the first step is positive, the second step of \nthe sequence is the HIV-1/HN-2 Ah differentiation \nimmunoassay. This confirmatory test detects and \ndifferentiates Ab to HN-1 and to HN-2. The \nresult is reported as HN-1 Ah detected, HIV-2 Ah \ndetected, non-differentiated HN Ah detected, or \nno Ah detected. \n(3) When the result of the second step does not confirm \nHIV (HN-1 Ab is negative or indeterminate and \nHIV-2 Ah is negative), a third step is required, \nwhich is an HIV-1 nucleic acid test, usually the \nHIV-1 quantitative RNA viral load. A positive \nHIV-1 RNA viral load confirms HN-1 infection. \nA negative HN-1 RNA viral load rules out HN \ninfection. \n(4) In summary, HN-1 in~ction is only confirmed \nwhen 2 steps of the HIV screening sequence are \n~itive. \n2. Specificity and sensitivity of the 3-step HIV sequence \na. When both the first and either the second or the \nthird tests are positive, the sensitivity > 99% and the \nspecificity of the 2-stcp test is about 99.6%. \nb. Very recent HIV infection prior to the appearance of \np24 Ag will be negative on the HN screening sequence. \nBecause p24 Ag appears around 14 days after infection, \nonly feprimary cases of HIV arc missed. Still, these \npatients may have poor outcomes and cawe further \nHN infections. \nPrevention and Treatment \nA. Prevention \n1. As noted above, male and female condoms are about \n95% effective in preventing HIV sexual transmission, but \nadherence is poor in many high-risk situations. \n2. Blood product screening has virtually eliminated transfusion-\nassociated HN transmission in the United States. \n3. Effective ART results in a very loviral load, decreasing \nthe risk of transmission by about 95%. The \"treatment as \nprevention\" strategy aims to identify HIV infection early \nand start effective therapy, reducing the spread of HIV. \n4. Preexposurc prophylaxis (PrcP) \na. A highly effective strategy of treating a seronegative \npe~on with a daily combination tablet that includes \n2 antiretroviral drugs, tcnofovir disoproxyl fumarate \nand emtricitabine to prevent HN infection. \n\n76 I CHAPTER 5 \n-\nHIV RNA (plasma) \nHIV Antibody \n\\ \nHIV-1 p24 Antigen \nHIV Infection \ni \n10 \n30 \n50 \n70 \nBO \n360 \n720 \nt \nt \nt \nt\noays \n~----+----4-----1----------1---------------------------------\nEclipse \n: \nI \nb \nI \nEstablished HIV Infection --------\nPeriod \n!

Should be offered to HIV sero-discordant c:ouples and \nindividuals at high risk for HIV infec:tion. \nc. To improve implementation, preexposure prophylaxis \nshould be initiated and monitored by all primary c:are \nproviders and not restricted to infectious disease and \nHIV specialists. \nd. The cost of the preexposure prophylaxis combination is \nwell c:overed by healthc:arc plans. \n5. Needle-exchange programs are effective in preventing the \nspread of HIV in IDUs. \n6. Mother-to-child-transmission \na. Most c:ases oc:c:ur at term (intrapartum) and with \nbreastfeeding, but there is a signiflc:ant risk during \npregnanc:y. \nb. HIV-infec:ted pregnant women are treated as soon as \npossible with ART so the viral load is undetec:table \nduring pregnanc:y and at the time of delivery. \nc. Postpartum, mothers are told not to breastfeed and the \nneonates receive postexposure ART prophylaxis. \nd. Women who do not reac:h a loviral load at \nterm {viral load< 1000 copies/ml) are offered \nan elective c:esarcan section to decrease the risk of \nmother-to-child-transmission. \ne.

Suc:h patients are often very ill and severely immuno-\ncompromised, and are at high risk for poor outcome. \nb. Even if they do well on ART, most only partially recover \ntheir immune function. \n3. Selec:tive high-risk screening is inefficient \na. Although most HIV-infected patients have increased \nrisk factors, clinicians do not consistently ask about risk \nfactors and may not even consistently screen patients \nwho present with another sexually transmitted or blood \nborne infection (\"missed opportunities\" for HIV testing). \nb. Patients may not report risk factors accurately especially \nif they fear the clinician may be judgmcntal. \nc. Not all HIV-infected patients have identifiable risk \nfactors, especially if HIV prevalence is higher in the \ngeneral population. \nd. Therefore, selective HIV sc:rcening of high-risk \nindividuals is very inefficient. \n4, Universal HIV screening recommended \na. CDC recommends routine HIV screening for patients \naged 13--64 years evaluated in all healthc:are settings \nunless the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infec:tion had \nbeen documented to be belo0.1 %. \nb. The United States Preventive Services Task Force \nrec:ommends universal voluntary HIV sc:reening of \nadolescents and adults (2012). \nc. Universal HIV screening has therefore become the \nrec:ognized standard of c:are in the United States. \nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 77 \nC. Treatment \n1. The first enc:ounter: the role of the primary c:are clinician \na. The first enc:ounter is essential in establishing a good \nclinician/ patient relationship. \nb. Patients who have just found out they have HIV tend to \nbe distraught and confused even if they are not totally \nsurprised by the diagnosis. \nc. Often patients do not believe that the diagnosis is \nc:orrec:t (HIV denial). \nd. Patients may believe wrongly that their life is over \nbec:ause they perc:eive that they will die soon from HIV, \nwill he unable to live a produc:tive and fulfilling life, will \nface severe drug adverse cffec:ts, or might infec:t their \nhousehold contacts. Suc:h misconceptions also enhance \nthe stigma associated with HIV. \ne. The primary care clinician should take the required \ntime necessary to reassure the patient that HIV c:an be \nmanaged well on a simple ART regimen with ac:ceptable \nside effec:ts in most people, and clarify the diagnosis, \ntransmission, and natural history. \n Providing ample time to answer questions and deal \nwith anxiety, depression, addiction, housing issues, \nhealthc:are insurance coverage, and partner notification \nis important. \ng. Referral to an infectious disease specialist {or internist \nwith specialized HIV practice) is required, hut the \nprimary c:are clinician should strongly c:onsider \ncontinuing to provide primary c:are to his or her \nHIV-infected patients. \n2. The role of the HIV specialist \na. The HIV specialist works with nurses, social workers, \nc:ase managers, HIV support groups, AIDS legal support \ngroups, addiction specialists, and psychiatrists to ensure \neffective HIV care and maximize adherence to ART. \nb. HIV-infected patients who adhere to ART are highly \nlikely to ac:hieve an undetectable HIV viral load and do \nwell over many years. \nc. HIV-infected patients who do not take their ART as \nprescribed progress to AIDS and their virus may acquire \nresistanc:e mutations to multiple agents. \n3. Laboratory testing \na. Assessment of current immunocompetence: absolute \nCD4TL count and CD4/CD3 perc:entage \nb. Test the HIV isolate: baseline HIV viral load and HIV \ngenotype to look for transmitted resistance-associated \nmutations before any ART is introduced \nc. Test for common coinfections \n(1) Patients should be screened for syphilis, hepatitis B, \nhepatitis C, T gom:lii (IgG), C trachomatis and \nNeisseria gono\"hoeae infection (in women and \nMSM) and human papillomavirus-related \nc:arcinomas {cervical c:ancer in women and anal \nc:ancer in MSM). \n(2) Latent TB infec:tion \n(a) The purified protein derivative (PPD) is the \nintradermal injection of tuberculin. In HIV \nand other immunocompromiscd patients, \nPPD is c:onsidercd positive if there is > 5 mm \nof induration at 48-72 hours. The test has \nsignific:ant limitations: \n(i) First, patients have to return for the reading \n48-72 hours later. \n\n78 I CHAPTER 5 \n(ii) Second, the test is not specific:: false positive \nPPD frequently oc:c:urs due to prior exposure \nto nontuberc:ulous myc:obac:teria or prior \nadministration of Bacille Calmette-Guerin \n(BCG). \n(iii) Third, PPD can be falsely negative when \na patient infected with HIV is unable to \nmount a delayed-type hypersensitivity \nresponse, usually due to a loCD4 count. \n(b) An interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) is \nfrequently preferred to PPD in HIV patients. \n(i) First, IGRA is much more specific: for \nlatent TB infection and is not affected \nby prior BCG vaccination, although it \ncan be positive with prior exposure to \nMycobacterium luznsasii or Mycobacterium \nmarinum. \n(ii) Second, when the patient is unable \nto mount an immune response to the \nM tuberculosis Ag included, IGRA will be \nindeterminate rather than negative. An \nindeterminate IGRA test is inconclusive and \ndoes not increase the probability ofTB or \nlatent TB infection. \nA positive PPD or IGRA never proves active \nTB, and a negative PPD or IGRA never rules \nout active TB. \nd. Baseline labs: CBC, comprehensive metabolic: panel, \nlipid panel; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) \nlevel, in case dapsone or primaquine required for PJP \n4. Immunizations \na. The response to vac:c:ines often is suboptimal unless \nthe CD4TL count is> 200 cells/mcL. The response to \nconjugated vac:c:ines is better so the tetanus/diphtheria/ \nacellular pertussis (TDAP) vaccine and the 13-valent \nconjugated pneumococ:c:al vaccine (Prevnar 13) are \nlikely to be effective even at lower CD4 count. \nb. Since ART often leads to significant immune \nreconstitution, delaying or repeating immunizations \nmay be useful. \nc. The recommendations for vaccinations in HIV-infected \npersons is summarized in Table 5-1. \nS. ART \na. ART has revolutionized HIV care. AIDS-defining \nillnesses, mortality, and hospitalizations have decreased \n60-80% since the introduction of ART. \nb. Effective ART requires complete suppression of viral \nreplication to prevent the emergence of mutations \nassociated with drug resistance. \nc. The cornerstone of therapy is the simultaneous and \nuninterrupttd use of generally 3 antiretroviral drugs to \nwhich the virus is susceptible. A fourth drug may be \nadded to boost the level of one of the active drugs. Often, \nit is possible to select a combination tablet that includes \nall required drugs, allowing a 1 pill once a day regimen. \nd. Complete suppression is realistic in most patients, \nprevents the worsening of immune deficiency and \nresults in at least partial immune reconstitution. \ne. Lifetime ART is necessary to prevent viral rebound \ndue to non-replicating, latent HIV in the reservoirs \n(including macrophages, resting CD4TL, memory c:ells \nand stem c:ells). \nTable 5-1.

Even in patients with a so-called \"undetectable viral \nload,\" there is a \"residual HIV viremia\" (1-5 copies/mL), \nwhich can only be assessed with advanced research \ntechniques. When ART is interrupted, the residual \nviremia re-infects activated CD4TL, leading to a relapse. \nHIV is not curable with ART alone. \n~-. Lifelong ART is required for all HIV infected \ny \npersons \ng. Indications for ART \n(l) ART is indicated all HIV-infected patients, \nincluding those with acute HIV infection and \nchronic symptomatic or asymptomatic infection \n(2) With Ols that involve the brain, ART is delayed \nto prevent immune-reconstitution-inflammatory \nsyndrome (IRIS) and cerebral edema associated \ncomplications. \n(3) Treating an infected patient prevents transmission \n{epidemiologic benefit) \n(a) Treating HIV-infected pregnant women \nprevents mother-to-child-transmission. \n(b) Treating infected persons decreases transmission \nto sex partners. \nh. Antiretroviral agents \n(1) Antiretroviral drugs belong to 5 classes \n(a) Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors \nblock reverse transcription of viral RNA into \nDNA by incorporation in the elongating chain \n{chain terminators). \n\n(b) Nonnudeoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors \n(NNRTis) block reverse transcription of \nviral RNA into DNA by binding to the \n\"NNRTI pocket\" in the p66 subunit of \nreverse transcriptase. \n(c) Integrase inhibitors prevent the integration of \nHIV DNA into the cdlular DNA \n(d) Protease inhibitors inhibit the HN protease, \nresulting in lack of cleavage of a viral \npolyprotein precursor. \n(e) Entry inhibitors \n(i) Ibalizumab, a recently approved anti-CD4 \nreceptor monoclonal Ab binds to the D2 \ndomain of the CD4 receptor, leading \nto conformational changes to the CD4 \nreceptor and HIV surface protein complex, \nwhich prevents further steps required for \nviral entry. \n(ii) Maraviroc prevents HN cell entry by \nblocking the CCR5 chemokine receptor, a \nco-receptor for HN surface protein. CCR5 \nreceptor inhibitors are effective only if HIV \nis exclusively CCR5-tropic, and does not \nuse CXCR4 at all. The use of the CXCR4 \nco-receptor increases in advanced HIY. The \nco-receptor tropism assay detects whether \nHIV is CCR5-tropic, CXCR4-tropic, or \ndual-tropic. \n(iii) Enfuvirtide, an oligopeptide, blocks the \nfusion of the HN envelope with the cell \nmembrane (fusion inhibitor) by binding to \nthe transmembrane glycoprotein gp4 l. \nL Adherence \n(1) Patient adherence is key. The regimen should be \neasy to take and well tolerated. Most patients are \nable to take a single tablet once a day that combines \n3 antiretroviral drugs with limited adverse effects. \n(2) Adherence of90-95% is required to maintain viral \ncontrol and prevent resistance. \n(3) High adherence has been shown to decrease \nmorbidity and mortality. \n(4) Moderatdy poor adherence (50-90%) still has \nstill significant clinical benefits but promotes viral \nresistance, leading to eventual failure of therapy. \n(5) Very poor adherence (belo50%) does not prevent \nprogression to AIDS (nor sdect for resistance). \n(6) Predictors of poor adherence include substance \nabuse, mental illness, lack of access to medical care \nor medications, lack of patient education, and poor \ntrust between patient and clinician. \nj. Testing for viral resistance \n(1) Performed at basdine to detect transmitted \nresistance and whenever the patient fails to achieve \nor maintain an undetectable viral load on ART \n(2) Both genotype and phenotype are available, but \nthe genotype is preferred because it provides faster \nresults, costs less, and is as clinically useful as the \nphenotype. \n(3) Decisions are complex and require expen guidance. \nDatabases of resistance-associated mutations hdp \ndecision-making. Stanford University HN-DB is a \nvery useful tool that is free and readily available on \nthe Internet. \nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 79 \nk. Monitoring: \n(1) Guiddines recommend monitoring viral load every \n3 months and CD4TL count at intervals. \n(2) Goal of therapy: undetectable viral load ( < 20/mcL) \nby 4-6 months \n(3) Failure to achieve viral suppression usually is \nsecondary to patient nonadherence, HN drug \nresistance, or both. Occasionally other factors \nare involved: malabsorption, drug interactions, \nselection of a suboptimal regimen with lower \npotency, and greater volume of distribution in \nlate pregnancy. \n6. Primary and secondary OI prophylaxis \na. Primary prophylaxis prevents the initial 0 I. \nb. Secondary prophylaxis prevents subsequent symptomatic \nepisodes after the initial OI (may not eradicate the \ninfection but can prevent illness). \nc. Primary or prophylaxis \n(1) The CD4TL cell count is the best predictor of \nsusceptibility to ors. \n(2) ART raises CD4TL count in most but not all \npatients, and markedly decreases the risk of Ols. \n(3) Susceptibility is determined by the current CD4TL \ncount rather than the nadir CD4TL count. \n(a) CD4TL < 200/mcL: PJP prophylaxis \nrecommended \n(b) CD4TL < 100/mcL: Toxoplasmosis prophylaxis \nrecommended if Toxoplasma IgG is positive \n(c) Isoniazid therapy for latent TB infection is \nrecommended if PPD causes at least 5 mm of \ninduration or the IGRA is positive. \nd. Primary or secondary OI prophylaxis may be \nstopped in patients in whom ART restores the \nCD4TL count above the level recommended for \nprimary prophylaxis. \n7. Major socioeconomic barriers to diagnosis and treatment \na. Lack of timdy access to high-quality healthcare \nb. Only partial drug cost coverage \nc. Poor support for treatment of drug addiction and \npsychiatric conditions \nd. Entrenched homelessness \ne. Poor care of some patients in jail \n HN-associated stigma remains an issue although \nsignificant progress has been achieved. \n8. The HN Care Continuum and HN Elimination \na. One important goal of treatment as prevention is the \nprevention of neHN infections. Patients on ART \nwho achieve and maintain undetectable viral loads do \nnot transmit HN. \nb. A second goal of treatment is to achieve the UNAIDS \n90-90-90% targets: by 2020, 90% of the HN-positive \npopulation diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed individuals \non ART, and 90% of patients on ART virologically \nsuppressed. Currently in the United States, of all \npersons infected with HIV, 86% are diagnosed, 63% \nare in care, 49% are retained in care, and 51 % have a \nsuppressed viral load (Figure 5-3). \nc. HN elimination would require that the reproductive \nrate of HIV infection be kept bdoone neinfection \nper 100 infected patients per year, which leads to a \ndecrease of prevalence over time. \n\n80 I CHAPTER 5 \n> \ni: \n:iii! 100 \n:c \n!?' \nBO \n~ \nCl) \ng. \n8. 40 \n(ii 20 \n'5 \nc: I \n86 \nDiagnosed \n49 \nReceipt \nRetained \nViral \nOf Care \nIn Care \nSuppression \nFigure 5-3. The HIV Care Continuum. (Reproduced with \npermission from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nUnderstanding the HIV Care Continuum.) \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nAli noted above, 3 factors determine the positive predictive value of \nthe test: the pretest probability, the sensitivity, and the specificity. \nMr. A is asymptomatic and denies high-risk behaviors. However, \nhe may not truly be at a lorisk of HIY, since he had a prior sex-\nually transmitted infection and did not always use a condom with \nhis 4 sex partners. His history of alcohol binges may also point to \nforgotten prior high-risk behaviors. The history of simultaneous \nsexual partners is also a risk factor. His pretest probability of HN \ninfection is therefore significantly higher than he believes. \n\nA \nfourth-generation \nHIV-1/2 \nAg/Ab \ncombination \nimmunoassay is positive. The HlV-1/HlV-2 Ab differentia-\ntion immunoassay confirmatory test detects HIV-1 Ab. \nconfirming HIV-1 infection. Because of the excellent spec-\nificity of the combined tests. his posttest probability of \nHIV Infection is > 99%. The CD4 TL count Is 150 cells/mcL \n(Immunologic AIDS) and the HIV viral load Is 00,000 copies/ \nmcL (high). Toxoplasma lgG Is negative. IGRA (q,uantlferon) Is \nnegative. \nHave you croesed a diagnostic threshold for \nthe leading hYPothe&le, HIV1 Are other teete \nnHded to fJXclude the altematlve diagnoses? \nCASE RESOLUTION \nMr. A is infected with HN-1 and his CD4TL count is diagnostic \nof immunologic AIDS. At this point, primary prophylaxis with \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is indicated to pre-\nvent PJP because the CD4TL count is < 200 cells/mcL. Prophy-\nlaxis for toxoplasmosis is not necessary since he is seronegative for \nT gondii. He does not need isoniazid since his IGRA is negative. \nThe patient should undergo blood testing for CBC with plate-\nlets, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, HBsAg, HBsAb, \nHBc total Ah, HCV Ab with reflex HCV viral load, G6PD level, \nand syphilis testing (using the reverse sequence syphilis algo-\nrithm). Urine nucleic ac:id test for Chlamydia and N gonorrho~ae \nis recommended. He should receive the influenza vacc:ine as well \nas two conjugate vacc:ines: TDAP and the conjugated 13-valent \npneumococcal vaccine (Prenar-13), which are both highly \nimmunogenic. Two months later he can receive the polysaccha-\nride 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax 23), but it \nis best to wait until the CD4 has increased > 200 cells/ mcL to \nimprove immunogenic:ity. Hepatitis B and hepatitis A combined \nvaccine series should also be offered after the CD4 has increased \nabove 200 cells/mcL. \nHe is in a monogamous sexual relationship with an HIV sero-\nnegative, uninfected female partner. To decrease her risk of acquiring \nHIY, they should use barrier precautions (male or female condoms \nare 95% effective), and he should start ART to lower his HN viral \nload to belothe level of detection (treatment as prevention> 95% \neffective). Ifhe is adherent to ART and his viral load is kept belo\n20 copies/mL, there is virtually no risk of transmission. However, the \nuse of barrier precautions is a safety feature in case he developed a \ndetectable viral load due to imperfect adherence to ART. Another \napproach if barrier precautions are not acceptable or adhered to is \nto provide preexposure prophylaxis with the combination of teno-\nfovir disoproxyl fumarate and emtricitabine daily to his girlfriend. \nThe tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine combination is not yet \napproved for preexposure prophylaxis but the DISCOVER trial is \nexpected to provide this information by 2019. If effective, it would \nbe associated with less nephrotoxicity and osteoporosis. \nI have an HIV-positive patient who complains of \nheadache. Hodo I determine the cause? \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr.Sis a 46-year-old man with AIDS and a CD4TL of 80 \ncells/mcL. He arrives at the hospital complaining of having \na headache for 2 weeks and low-grade fever for 5 days. \nHe denies confusion, focal weakness. or seizures. He is \nfebrile to 38.8C. His neck is supple. The neurologic exam \nIs nonfocal. \n~ \nWhat ie the differential diagnoeis of headac:he \n1\\,!1\"' In HIV-poeltlve patlente1 Howould you frame \nthe differential? \n\nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThree pivotal considerations help frame the differential diagnosis \nin HN-infected persons with neurologic complaints: (1) the acuity \nof the symptoms, (2) the degree ofimmunosuppression (CD4TL), \nand (3) whether the patient has focal neurologic signs and/or a \nfocal abnormality on neuroimaging. \nThe first pivotal step in evaluating the HN-positive patient \nwith headache is to determine the acuity of the presentation. Most \nOis have a subacute onset. In HN-infected patients with an acute \nonset of headache and fever (< 3 dayi;), virulent pathogens must \nbe considered including bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis, \nmost commonly herpes simplex-I (HSV-1) and West Nile virus \nencephalitis. \nThe second pivotal issue is to assess the degree of immunosup-\nprmion. HN-positive patients with intact immunity and CD4TL \n> 200 cells/mcL are at markedly diminished risk of Ols. The \ndifferential diagnosis of such headaches is therefore similar to \npatients without HN infection; however, HN itself can cause \naseptic meningitis or encephalopathy in acute HN with high viral \nloads. As the immunosuppression worsens and the CD4TL falls \n< 200 cells/mcL, the differential diagnosis broadens to include \nOls and PCL. \nThe third pivotal issue is to determine whether or not the \npatient has focal neurologic signs typically associated with a \nfocal abnormality on neuroimaging (mass lesion or focal white \nmatter disease). The most common diagnoses in HIV-infected \npatients with loCD4TL who have focal neurologic signs or \nmass lesions on neuroimaging are toxoplasmosis and PCL, as \nwell as PML (plaques of demyelination). The most common \ndiagnoses in HIV-infected patients with loCD4TL who have \na nonfocal neurologic presentation and without focal findings \non neuroimaging are cryptococcal meningitis, other fungal \nmeningitis (coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis), TB men-\ningitis, and syphilis. Both CNS imaging (CT and MRI) and \nlumbar puncture (LP) are frequently required to confirm the \ndiagnosis. In clinical practice, a CT scan is usually performed \nprior to LP because it rapidly rules out a large mass lesion that \nmay cause post LP herniation. Platelet count, prothrombin \ntime, and panial thromboplastin time should be checked to \nensure the patient is not at an increased risk for developing \na spinal epidural hemorrhage from the LP. An MRI is often \nperformed subsequently due to its substantially increased sen-\nsitivity for several diagnoses. A diagnostic algorithm for the \nevaluation of headache in HIV-positive patients is summarized \nin Figure 5-4. \nDifferential Diagnosis of Headache \nin Patient with HIV \nA. Acute neurologic presentation \n1. Bacterial meningitis due to Nrisseria meningitidis, \nS pneumoniae, or Listeria monocytogenes \n2.

Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with \nHN infection \nB. Neurologic presentation with subacute meningitis \n1. Cryptococcal meningitis \n2. Coccidioidomycosis (southwestern United States) \n3.

Nonfocal neurologic presentation with diffuse, chronic brain \ninvolvement \n1. HN encephalopathy in advanced AIDS \n2. CMV encephalitis \n3. Neurosyphilis with general paresis and dementia \nD. Mass lesions or focal demydination \n1. Toxoplasmosis (rim-enhancing mass lesions) \n2. PCL (diffusely-enhancing mass lesions) \n3. PML (focal areas of demyelination without enhancement \nor mass effect) \n4. Uncommon mass lesions: tuberculoma, cryptococcoma, \nNocardia brain abscess, bacterial or fungal brain abscess \n\nMr. S reports that his headache began 14 days ~o. The \nheadache is described as frontal, unrelenting, and pound-\ning. He complains of subj ective fevers. sweats, and chills. \nHe admit s to mlld photophobla. Persistent vomit ing has \ndeveloped over the last 6 days. He denies any history of \nconfusion or seizures. \nPast medical history ls remarkable for a long his-\ntory of IDU. His last reported IDU was 2 years ago. HIV \nwas diagnosed 9 years ~o. He has not been adherent \nwith ART or PJP prophylaxis with daily TMP-SMX. He \ntakes no medications. A CD4 TL count 1 year ago was \n2 cells/mcl. \nAt this polnt, what Is the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altematlves, and Is \nthere a must not miss diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests should 176 \nordsred? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe first pivotal consideration is that Mr. S has had a headache \nfor 2 weeks (subacute). This suggests a relatively less virulent 01 \nrather than a virulent bacterial meningitis or HSV-1 encephalitis. \nSecond, his prior CD4TL indicates profound immunosup-\npression. Therefore, he is at risk for all the serious Ols listed \nabove. The third pivotal issue is whether there is a mass lesion. \nUltimately, this will be confirmed or excluded on neuroimaging, \nbut his photophobia suggests some form of meningoencephalitis. \nCryptococcal meningitis is the most common meningitis seen \nin AIDS and is the leading hypothesis. Less common causes of \nmeningoencephalitis include neurosyphilis, TB meningitis, and \nother fungal meningitis (coccidioidomycosis in the southwest-\nern United States, and histoplasmosis and blastomycosis in the \nMidwest). HN aseptic meningitis may present with headache. \nShould neuroimaging confirm a focal abnormality, common \ncauses include toxoplasmosis, PML, and PCL. Since Mr. S has \nnot taken TMP-SMX prophylaxis, he is at increased risk for toxo-\nplasmosis, the most common CNS mass lesion in AIDS patients. \nFinally, given his history of IDU, he is also at risk for a brain \nabscess secondary to Staphy/.ococcus aureus.

Cryptococcus is the most common. However, \na brain MRI is more sensitive for mass lesions and demyelinating \nlesions and should be performed. \nLeading Hypothesis: Cryptococcal \nMeningoencephalitis \nTenbook Presentation \nPatients typically have a subacute headache, malaise, and fever that \ndevelop over days to weeks. Mental status changes may be seen. \nImportantly, meningismus is often absent due to the host's inabil-\nity to mount an inflammatory reaction. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Most common cause of meningoencephalitis in AIDS \nB. Encapsulated fungus acquired via inhalation \nC. CNS infection due to dissemination of primary infection \nD. Usually in patients with CD4TL < 100 cells/mcL \nE. Subacute onset over 2-4 weeks \nF. Basilar meningitis or meningoencephalitis: classic meningeal \nsymptoms and signs (neck stiffness, photophobia) present in a \nminority of patients (25-30%) \nG. 70% of patients have increased intracranial pressure: > 20 cm \nHp in lateral decubitus position. \nI. Elevated intracranial pressure associated with increased risk \nof death \n2. Patients with elevated intracranial pressure have worse \nsymptoms (headaches, clouded sensorium). \nH. Meningovascular presentation (cerebrovascular accident from \narteritis) and cryptococcoma (mass lesion) may be seen. \nI. Mortality 6-12% \nEvidence--Based Diagnosis \nA. History \nI. Fever: 65-95% \n2. Headache: 73-100% \n3. Median duration of symptoms: 31 days (1-120 days) \nB. Physical exam \n1. Stiff neck: 22-27% \n2. Photophobia: 18-22% \n\n84 I CHAPTER 5 \n3. Mental status changes: 22% \n4. Focal neurologic signs or seizures: 10% \n5. No CNS signs or symptoms: 14% \nCryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients is \noften indolent. Only a minority of patients \nexhibit meningismus or photophobia. Some \npatients have only low-grade fever and malaise. \nA supple neck does not rule out the diagnosis, \nand a high index of suspicion is required. \nC. Laboratory findings \n1. Blood tests \na. Blood cultures positive in 55% in AIDS, much higher \nthan in other populations with cryptococcal meningitis \nb. Serum cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) \n(1) 95-100% sensitive, 96% specific \n(2) LR+, 24; LR-, 0.05 \n2. LP \n(3) Negative serum CRAG makes cryptococcal \nmeningitis unlikdy. \n(4) A positive serum CRAG may precede clinical \ncryptococcal meningitis by weeks to months. \na. Neuroimaging required before LP to rule out mass \neffect. Mass lesions are often due to concomitant \ntoxoplasmosis or PCL, and only rardy due to \ncryptococcoma. \nb. A platdet count, prothrombin time, and partial \nthromboplastin time are performed before LP to rule \nout a bleeding diathesis, with its risk of spinal epidural \nhem a to ma. \nc. LP is required in patients with suspected cryptococcal \nmeningoencephalitis regardless of serum CRAG results. \n(1) In patients with positive serum CRAG, LP is \nnecessary to confirm cryptococcal meningitis, \nmeasure opening pressure, manage high intracranial \npressure, and exclude other diagnoses. \n(2) In patients with negative serum CRAG, LP is \nnecessary to evaluate other diagnoses. \nd. Routine CSP findings are often normal or minimally \nabnormal in patients with cryptococcal meningitis. \n(1) Normal glucose, protein, and WBC: 19-30% \n(2) Glucose < 50 mg/dL: 64% \n(3) Protein> 40 mg/dL: 64% \n(4) CSF WBCs > 5 cells/mcL: 35% \n(5) Increased opening pressure: 50-75% \nRoutine CSF findings in patients with cryp-\ntococcal meningitis may be normal. Specific \nstudies (fungal culture, cryptococcal antigen) \nmust be obtained. \ne. Special CSF studies \n(1) CSF CRAG: 91-100% sensitive, 93-98% specific \n(2) CSF fungal culture: 95-100% sensitive, 100% \nspecific \n(3) CSF Gram stain may be positive, and India ink \ndetects encapsulated yeast in 60-80% of cases but \nis no longer performed routindy. \n(4) Cryptococcus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may \nbe included as part of a CSF multi-target PCR \npand used for the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis \n{see bdow). \nTreatment \nA. Monality is increased in patients with abnormal mental \nstatus, an increased opening pressure on LP, and those with a \nmarkedly devated CSF CRAG (> I: I 024). Loglycorrachia \nand normal CSF cell counts also predict poor outcomes. \nB. Induction therapy relies on the combination of IV liposomal \namphotericin B (3-4 mg/kg) and oral flucytosine (100 mg/kg) \nfor at least 2 weeks, and at least until clinical improvement \nand sterilization of CSF culrures. \nC. After successful induction therapy, high-dose fluconazole \n(400 mg/day) is substiruted for an additional 8-10 weeks. \nD. Maintenance therapy should then be continued with lower-\ndose fluconazole (200 mg/day) for a minimum of I year. \nUsually fluconazole is then stopped in patients with an \nexcellent response to ART and CD4TL > 100 cells/mcL. \nE. In patients with high intracranial pressure, serial LPs are per-\nformed to lower opening pressure to< 20 cm H 20 or by 50%; \npatients with hydrocephalus may require ventricular shunts. \nF. Optimal timing of starting ART is controversial in crypto-\ncoccal meningitis. Clearly, ART-associated IRIS can result in \nworsening intracranial pressure and neurologic starus. It is \nreasonable to dday initiation of ART for at least 4 weeks or \neven longer if intracranial pressure remains elevated. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nBlood cultures and serum CRAG are ordered. A toxicol-\noqy screen is positive fur opioids and cocaine. CBC reveals \nWBC of 3700 cells/mcL (8% lymphocytes). HGT of 36.6 \nand platelet count of 240,000 cells/mcl. PT and P1T are \nnonnal. Serum Treponema pallldum enzyme Immunoassay \n(TP-EIA) is n~ative, ruling out syphilis. \nLP reveals opening pressure of 30 cm Hp, glucose \n26 mg/dL (versus serum of 127 mg/dL), and protein \n68 mg/dL (nonnal 15-45 mg/dL). CSF cell count \nhas 20 WBC/mcL and CSF Gram stain shows numerous \nyeast forms. CSF VDRL Is negative. \nHave you cro55ed a diagnostic threshold \nfor the leat.:ling hYfJOthHie, cryptococcal \nmeningitis? Have you ruled out the active \nalternative&? Do other test& need to 1'e done \nto exclude the alternative diagnoeee? \nThe CSF findings strongly suggest cryptococcal meningitis. Posi-\ntive CRAG or fungal culture will confirm the diagnosis. However, \npatients with AIDS may have simultaneous infi:ctions and you revie\nother diagnoses on the differential. There is no travel history to the \nsouthwestem United States that would increase the probability of \ncoccidioidomycosis. Neurosyphilis is highly unlikdy because of the \nnegative CSF venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and serum \nTP-EIA. An MRI is more sensitive in the detection of CNS mass \nlesions than a contrast CT and is indicated to confidently exclude \nalternative diagnoses associated with masses or demyelination. \n\nOf note, multiplex (multi-target) PCR testing is available for \nCNS infections. For example, the BioFire FilmArray meningitis/ \nencephalitis panel detects 14 targets including one fungal target \n(C tuofarmans/gattii), 6 bacterial targets (S pneumonbu, N men-\ningitidis, L monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenr,ae, Eschtrichia \ncoli Kl, and Streptococcus agalactiM) and 7 viral targets (CMY, \nenterovirus, parechovirus, HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6, and VZV). \nThe sensitivity of this test to detect Cryptococcus is reported high \n(96%) in untreated cryptococcal meningitis. With treatment, the \nPCR becomes negative rapidly, whereas the CSF CRAG remains \ndetectable for months. When using a nediagnostic test like a \nmultiplex PCR test for meningoencephalitis, it is essential to \nconsider reported sensitivity and specificity as preliminary because \nlater data may identify unrecognized test limitations {resulting in \nmore false-positive and/or false-negative test results). \nAlternative Diagnosis: Toxoplasmic Encephalitis \nTextbook Presentation \nToxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) in AIDS patients typically presents \nsubacutely over 1-2 weeks. Focal neurologic manifestations are \ncommon. Confusion and mental status changes may dominate the \nclinical picture. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Seroprevalence of asymptomatic Toxoplasma infection (positive \nT gonJii IgG) is around 11 % in the US population versus \n40-80% in some European, African, and Asian countries. \nB. Primary infection is acquired after eating undercooked meat \nwith tissue bradyzoites (tissue cysts) or ingesting OOC}'lits shed \nin cat feces and matured in the environment for > 24 hours. \nIn the United States, eating raoysters, clams, and mussels \nhas recently been identified as a risk factor. \nC. TE usually causes focal abscess with headache, confusion, \nmotor weakness, and fever. Focal neurologic findings may be \npresent. Seizures and altered mental status may develop in \nuntreated patients. CT scan and MRI of the brain often sho\nmultiple ring-enhancing mass lesions with significant sur-\nrounding edema, located in the gray matter of the cortex and \nbasal ganglia. TE is the most common etiology of CNS mass \nlesion in AIDS patients. \nD. TE is secondary to reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis in \nbrain tissue C}'lits: > 95% of patients have positive IgG titers, \nbut IgM is not usually identified. False-negative IgG may be \nseen even with reactivation. \nE. CD4TL < 100 cells/ mcL in 80% of patients; CD4TI.. \n< 50 cells/mcL increases the risk further \nF. Before ART, the 12-month probability of developing TE was \n33% in AIDS patients with CD4TL counts< 100 cells/mcL \nand positive toxoplasmosis serology if not receiving prophy-\nlaxis for TE. ART has decreased the incidence of TE. \nG. TE may be the initial manifestation or a subsequent \nmanifestation of HIV infection. \nH. 27% mortality despite treatment \nI. Other concurrent CNS infections common \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \n1. Headache (often frontal and bilateral): 49-73% \n2. Seizures: 15-31 % \n3. Hallucinations: 8% \n4. Fever: 4-68% \nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 85 \nB. Physical exam \n1. Focal findings {weakness, abnormal gait, or other): \n73--88% \n2. Mental status changes: 50--67% \n3. Mental status changes dominating clinical picture: 40% \n4. Cognitive impairment (with normal arousal): 66% \n5. Stiff neck: 0% \nMeningismus is distinctly uncommon in TE \nand suggests an alternate or additional disease \nprocess. \nC. Laboratory findings \n1. Serology \na. Toxoplasma lgG: = 97% sensitive but does not confirm \nactive TE \n~ \nTE unlikely in patients with negative \ny \nToxoplasma IgG \nb. Toxoplasma IgM: insensitive (15%} because disease is \nusually secondary to reactivation. \nc. Probability ofTE in seropositive patients with mass \neffect markedly reduced in patients receiving TMP-\nSMX prophylaxis (from 87% to 59%) \n2. CSF analysis \na. Standard CSF analysis may be normal or nonspecifically \nelevated. \nb. Percentage of patients with abnormal findings \n(1) WBC > 5 cells/mcL: 50% \n(2) Protein> 40 mg/dL: 81 % \n(3) Loglucose: 14% \nc. CSF PCR insensitive for CNS toxoplasmosis but highly \nspecific \n(1) 54% sensitive, 99% specific \n(2) LR+, 54; LR-, 0.46 \n3. Neuroimaging \na. MRI is test of choice. \n(1) Superior to contrast CT, affecting course in 40% of \npatients \n(2) One or more ring-enhancing lesions with mass \neffect and cdema (Figure 5-5} \n(3) Lesions may be located in gray matter of basal \nganglia, thalamus, and cortex. \n(4) Single lesion in 14% of patients, multiple lesions in \n86% \n(5) Single lesion on MRI makes TE less likely and \nincreases likelihood of PCL. \nb. CT scan with contrast abnormal in 87-96% \n(1) Single ring-enhancing lesion: 35% \n(2) ~ 2 ring-enhancing lesions: 62% \n(3) Hypodense lesions: 13% \n(4) Moderate to severe cerebral edema: 48% \n(5) 75% oflesions located in cerebral hemispheres \n(6) MRI is recommended in patients with normal \ncontrast CT scan or a single enhancing lesion. \n\n86 I CHAPTER 5 \nDleeue \nKey \nFeaturee \nMullfple ring enhancing lesions \nDiffuse scalloped white matter l96lons \nSingle or multiple enhancing ma88(es) \nFigure 5-5.

Sensitivity of standard hematoxylin & eosin staining \nonly 50-66%. Immunoperoxidasc staining improves \nscnsjtivity. \nc. Brain biopsy is associated with 0.5-3.1 % mortality and \nhigh morbidity. \nd. Brain biopsy is not done routinely due to complications \nand imperfect sensitMty. \nTreatment \nA. Empiric treatment fur TE instituted in patients with all \nof the following criteria: multiple mass lesions, CD4TI \n< 100 cellsfmcL, positive serum T(#()p/mma IgG, and patient \nnot already taking toxoplasmosis prophylaxis (Figure 5..()). \nBiopsy is reserved fur atypical cases (ie, ne~tive serology or \nnonresponders within 7-10 days). \nB. Pyrimetlwnine plus sulfadiazine (pyrimethamine plus high \ndose clindamycin if allergy or intolerance to sulfona.mides) \nC. Folinic acid also administered to patients taking \npyrimethamine to decrease coxicity \nD. TMP-SMX is a te.ss effective alternative therapy. \nE.

After induction therapy for 6 weeks, suppre.ssive therapy with \nlower doses is used. Suppressive therapy can be discontinued \nin asymptomatic patients in whom ART has restored CD4TL \nto > 200 cells/mc.L for ~ 6 months. \nH. Corticosteroids are only indicated for patients with cerebral \ned.ema 1tnJ midline shift, or clinical deterioration within first \n48 hours of therapy. Corticosteroids complicate interpretation \nof response to therapy since they reduce edema and the size of \nPCL lesions. \nI.

Empiric therapy for CNS toxoplasmosls In AIDS \npatients. \n\nIRIS associated with TE is not as common (about 5%) and \ncan be managed well with corticosteroids. \nJ. Prevention \n1. HIV-positive patients with CD4TL < 200 cells/mcL \nand positive serum Toxoplllsma IgG should receive daily \nTMP-SMX as primary prophylaxis. \n2. If patients are allergic to sulfu, they may instead receive \natovaquone (also effective in preventing Pneumocystis \npneumonia) or dapsone plus pyrimeth.amine. \n3. The risk ofTE is lounless the CD4TC count is \n< 100 cells/mcL. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Progressive \nMultifocal Leukoencephalopathy \nTextbook Presentation \nPML typically presents with progressive neurologic deficits, in par-\nticular weakness or gait disorders, over weeks to months. PML may \nalso present with visual problems, headache, alterations in mental \nstatus, or dementia with focal signs. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Etiologic agent is JC virus, a polyomavirus (not to be confused \nwith Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a prion-related illness). \nB. Primary JC virus infection is common in childhood and usually \nasymptomatic, with seroprevalence of 39-69% among adults. \nC. PML is much more common in AIDS than in non-\nHIV-infected immunosuppressed persons: before ART, PML \ndeveloped in 3-7% of persons with AIDS. Profound immu-\nnosuppression allows latent JC virus in reticuloendothelial \nsystem and kidney to gain access to CNS and replicate. \nD. Subsequent infection and lysis of the myelin-producing \noligodendrocytes results in PML. Astrocytes may be infected. \nE. Multifocal or unifocal white matter lesions seen, forming large \nplaques distributed asymmetrically. \nF. Mean CD4TL count 84-104 cells/mcL: 25% of patients have \nCD4TL count > 200 cells/mcL \nG. ART is the mainstay of treatment: 63% of patients started \non ART because of PML survive > 2 years. A majority of \nthem have either improvement or stabilization of neurologic \nfunction. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam \n1. Limb weakness: 50-70% \n2. Gait disorder: 26--64% \n3. Speech disorder: 31-51% \n4. Visual impairment (hemianopsia): 21-50% \nS. Seizures: 5-23% \n6. Headaches: 23% \n7. Cognitive abnormalities/mental status changes: 25-65% \n8. Cranial nerve palsies: 31 % \nB. Laboratory findings \n1. Serum antibodies to JC virus are not useful due to high \nprevalence of infection. \n2. CSF \na. Routine studies may be normal or nonspecifically \nelevated. \nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 81 \nb. CSF PCR for JC virus DNA: \n(1) 70-90% sensitive, 98% specific \n(2) LR+ (average), 40; LR-, 0.20 \n(3) Some tests are more sensitive (detect lolevel of \nJC virus) and repeat analysis increases sensitivity \nto 90%. \n(4) Sensitivity is diminished in patients receiving ART. \n3. CNS imaging \na. Typically shows extensive multifocal patchy white \nmatter demyelination with sparing of the cortical \ngray matter \nb. MRI more sensitive than CT scanning (CT 63% sensitive) \n(See Figure 5-5) \nc. Lesions hypodense on CT scanning, lointensity on \nTI-weighted MRI, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI \ncl On imaging, lesions are restricted to the subcortical \nwhite matter, respecting the gray-white junction of the \ncerebrum. \ne. There is overlap in the MRI features ofTE, PCL, and \nPML. However, cenain features suggest PML: \n(1) Lack of enhancement (except peri-plaque \nenhancement after starting ART, consistent \nwith IRIS) \n(2) Lack of mass effect \n(3) Less well-circumscribed lesions \nf. MRI typically shows scalloping at gray-white matter \ninterfuce (see Figure 5~5). \ng. CT scanning typically demonstrates white matter \nhypodense lesions. \nh. Brain biopsy: 100% speciflc but sensitivities only 64% \nto 96% due to sampling error \nTreatment \nMRI is markedly superior to CT for diagnosis \nofPML. \nA. ART is associated with improvement or cure in some patients. \n1. Survival pre-ART averaged 4-6 months. Survival has \nimproved to 60% since the introduction of ART. \n2. 80% of survivors have significant residual neurologic deficits \n3. Some patients receiving ART develop IRIS with worsening \nof symptoms and enhancement around the PML plaques \non MRI; this is managed with corticosteroids. \nB. Initiation of ART occasionally results in PML in previously \nasymptomatic patients due to increased inflammation \nassociated with IRIS (unmasking IRIS). \nAlternative Diagnosis: Primary CNS \nLymphoma (PCL) \nTextbook Presentation \nTypically, PCL develops in patients with advanced AIDS. While \npatients may present with focal signs such as weakness, many \npatients present with altered mental status or seizures. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Biologically distinct from PCL in other immunocompromised \nstates \n\n88 I CHAPTER 5 \nB. Diffuse, high-grade, B 1:ell, non-Hodgkin lymphoma arising \nand oonfined to the CNS (not due to CNS involvement by \nsystemic lymphoma} \nC. CD4TL usually < 50 1:ells/m1:L \nD. Consistently associated with EBY (early EBY RNA trans1:ripts \ndete1:ted in 100% of biopsies) \nE. Pathogenesis likely involves activation of latent EBY genes due \nto immunodeficiency. The relative immunologic sancmary of \nthe CNS from immune surveillance may facilitate growth of \nthese tumors at this location. \nF. Rapidly progressive with a short interval from symptoms to \ndiagnosis (1.8 months) \nG. Median survival without treatment is about 1 month. \nH. Supratentorial location 3 times more common than \ninfratentorial. \nI. Most common cause of death in patients with PCL is \nother 01. \nJ. Marked reduction in PCL incidence {about 90%} from \n1995 to 2000 because of the introduction of ART \nEvidence--Based Diagnosil \nA. History and physical exam \nI. B symptoms (weight loss > 10% body weight, unexplained \ntemperarures > 38.0\"C, drenching sweats): present in 80% \n2. Focal neurologk deficits: 51 % \n3. Mental status changes: 53% \n4. Seizures: 27% \nB. Laboratory findings \nI. CSF EBYPCR: \na. 87% sensitive, 98% specific \nb. LR+, 43; LR-, 0.13 \n2. Positive CSF cytology only 15-23% sensitive. Spel:ial srudies \nare required to distinguish monoclonal proliferations from \nreactive T 1:ell populations. \nC. Radiologic studies \nI. CT scanning \na. 90% sensitive \nb. Usually reveals contrast enhancement (90%}, \ncharacteristically diffuse rather than ring enhancement \nc. 48% single lesion, 52% multiple lesions \nd. Usually associated with mass effect (as in toxoplasmosis \nbut not seen in PML) \n2. MRI more sensitive than CT scanning (see Figure 5-5) \n3. SPECT thallium imaging \na. PCL usually demonstrates early uptake and retention \n(compared with decreased uptake in necrotic centers of \ntoxoplasmosis}. \n(1) 86-100% sensitive, 77-100% specific (higher \nspecificity if retention index measured). \n(2) In1:reased uptake is noted in 15% of patients with \nTE not re1:eiving ART but up to 50% of patients \nwith TE receiving ART, making this test less useful \nwhen on ART. \nD. Biopsy \nI. Positive CSF EBY PCR makes biopsy unnecessary if \nimaging is typical. \n2. Biopsy is useful when CSF EBY PCR is negative. \n3. Lympholytic effect of corticosteroids may render biopsy \nnondiagnostic. \nTreatment \nCortioosteroids should generally not be \nadministered before brain biopsy in patients \nwith suspected PCL unless the patient is at an \nincreased risk for herniation. \nA. AIDS-related PCL is a complication of end-stage AIDS, and \nprognosis is grave without therapy, with a median survival of \n3 months. \nB. Options for treatment include whole-brain radiation therapy \nand high-dose methouexate-based chemotherapy. \nI. Whole-brain radiation therapy is no longer considered first-\nline therapy, since it is associated with irreversible cognitive \ndysfunction and does not improve survival. \n2. Adding ART to high-dose methotrexate-based \nchemotherapy improves the prognosis. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. S's LP reveals t hat CSF CRAG is positive at a t iter \nof 1 :512. Both 1:71ood and CSF cultures are positive for \nC neoformans. A 1:7raln MRI confirmed the al:7sence of a \nCNS mass. Sul:7sequent CSF AFB cultures and VDRL were \nnegative. \nMr. S's CSF culture confirms cryptococcal meningitis. The sub-\namte oourse and lack of meningeal findings are common features \nof this disease. CSF analysis did not suggest oonoomitant myco-\nbacterial infection or neurosyphilis, and the MRI did not suggest \ntoxoplasmosis, PML or PCL. \n\nMr. S received com l:71natlon Induction therapy with llposomal \namphoterlcin Band flucytosine, and initially underwent daily \nLPs until intracranial pressure normalized. After complet-\ning induction therapy for 2 weeks, he was switched to oral \nfluconazole (4 00mg/day), 1:7ecause he had excellent cllnlcal \nImprovement and repeat LP fungal culture was negative \nand was discharged to follow-up wit h t he Infectious dis-\nease clinic. ART was delayed for a total of6 weeks to avoid \nIRIS-associated complicatlons. After 8 weeks, fluconazole \nwas decreased to 200 mg/day, which he cont inued for \n10 more months. It was discontinued at that time, as his \nCD4 TL had Increased al:7ove 20 0 cells/mcL for 6 mont hs. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nHIV Encephalopathy (HIV-associated Dementia) \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with severe HIV encephalopathy typically have advanced \nAIDS with a slowly progressive dementia eventually accompanied \nby motor symptoms. \n\nDisease Higb.lights \nA. Subconical dementia characterized by cognitive, behavioral, \nand psychomotor slowing \nB. Prevalence 15-20% in AIDS prior to introduction of ART \nC. 40-50% decrease in incidence since the introduction of ART. \nHowever, prevalence is rising due to increasing survival. \nD. Severe form of HIV encephalopathy effectively eliminated if \ntreated with ART \nE. Milder deficits still commonly detected by neuropsychological \ntesting \nF. Principal target of HIV virus is perivascular CNS macrophages. \nAstrocytes may also become infected. \nG. Severe HN encephalopathy develops late with CD41L typically \n< 200 cells/mcL. \nH. Two-fold increased risk in patients aged~ 50 years. \nI. Neurotoxicity ofHN may be synergistic with that of cocaine \nor methamphetamine. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam \n1. Memory complaints: 70% \n2. Cognitive slowing: 25-30% \n3. Gait difficulty: 45% \n4. Behavioral changes: 10-20% \n5. Seizures: 5-10% \n6. Focal findings uncommon \nB. Laboratory findings \n1. MRI: T2 images with hyperintensities in the deep white \nmatter and basal ganglia without contrast enhancement \nand/or atrophy; the distribution of lesions is symmetrical \nin contrast to PML lesions. \n2. CSF \na. Useful to rule out other infectlons \nb. Mild CSF leukocytosis and protein devations may be seen. \nc. CSF HN RNA levels are not useful because they do not \ncorrdate with the severity of HIV encephalopathy. \nd. Cannot diagnose HN encephalopathy with cenainty \n3. Neuropsychological testing useful in evaluating the severity \nand response to ART \nTreatment \nHN encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. \nDiagnostic evaluations serve to exclude other \nOls, malignancy, or substance abuse. \nA. Most patients treated with ART shoonly partial reversal of \nneurologic deficits. Early therapy is therefore important. \nB. Elevated levds of CSF beta-microglobulin (suggesting ongoing \ninflammation) predicted better neurologic recovery with ART. \nNeurosyphilis in HIV-Positive Patients \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with neurosyphilis may be asymptomatic or have a number \nof clinical presentations, including aseptic meningitis, stroke-like \nsymptoms, visual impairment, hearing loss, dementia, and various \nfocal deficits. \nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 89 \nDiseue Higb.lights \nA. Caused by the spirochete T pallidum \nB. High-risk groups: MSMs, ID Us, and patrons of sex workers \nC. Association of HN and syphilis infection \n1. Studies document a high HN coinfection rate in patients \nwith syphilis: CDC repons that in 2016 among primary \nand secondary syphilis cases with known HN-status, \n47.0% of cases among MSM were HIV-positive, compared \nwith 10.7% of cases among men who have sex with \nwomen, and 4.1 % of cases among women. \n~ \nHIV infection in patients with syphilis is \ny \ncommon, especially in MSMs. \n2. Neurosyphilis in HIV-infected less frequent (1 %) \nD. Syphilis commonly infects the CNS early in the course of \ndisease in both HN-infected and non-HN-infected persons \n(25-33%). \nE. The CNS infection is more often progressive in HIV-infected \npersons, increasing the need for detection in this group. \nF. Infections devdop in characteristic stages. \n1. Primary syphilis: syphilitic chancre \na. Characterized by chancre: a 0.5- to 2-cm painless, \nindurated, wdl-circumscribed ulceration at the site of \nprimary inoculation approximatdy 2-3 weeks after \ncontact (Figure 5-7) \nb. Atypical presentations are common. Multiple chancres \nmay be seen more often in HN-infected patients. \nc. Lesion resolves with or without therapy. \n2. Secondary syphilis \na. Symptoms usually start with a rash that is usually not \nitchy and may appear as the chancre is healing or up to \nseveral weeks later. \nb. The secondary syphilis rash is macular or \nmaculopapular, and often involves the palms and/or \nsoles, but may have an atypical aspect or be completdy \nunnoticed (faint rash or darker skin) (Figure 5-8). \nSecondary syphilis should always be considered \nin ~e di~erential diagnosis of rash in sexually \nactive pattents. \nc. Other skin findings may be present: \n(1) Mucosal patches are superficial erosions in the \nmouth and genital areas. \n(2) Condyloma lata are large, moist, pink to gray/ \nwhite raised lesions seen in perianal area, vulva, \nor scrotum. \nd. Other symptoms include fever, myalgias, sore throat, \nlymphadenopathy, headaches, and hair loss. \n3. Latent syphilis: 60-70% of untreated patients have no \ndisease progression. \na. Early latent syphilis: < 1 year duration \nb. Late latent syphilis: > 1 year duration \nc. Latent syphilis of unknown duration: no prior negative \nserology to determine duration \n4.

Serologic diagnosis of syphilis \n1. Types of syphilis tests \na. Nontreponemal tests serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) \nandCSFVDRL \n(1) Detect antibodies to cardiolipin \n(2) Not specific fur treponemal infection (false-positive \nin 1-2% of the US population) \n(3) Decrease in titer and may become negative after \nappropriate treatment of syphilis \n(4) May be falsdy negative in long-standing latent infection \nb. Treponemal tests: fluorescent treponemal antibody \nabsorbed {FTA-ABS), T paliidum enzyme immunoassay \n(TP-EIA), T pat/idum particle agglutination (TP-PA), \nand T pallidum microhemagglutination (MHA-TP) \n(1) Detect specific treponemal antibodies \n(2) May remain positive for life even after appropriate \ntreatment \n(3) Cannot distinguish between treated and untreated \ninfections \n2. Classic algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis \na. Nontreponemal test (RPR) is performed first \nb. If RPR is positive, a confirmatory treponemal test is \nperformed (FTA-ABS) \nc. If RPR is positive, the lab determines the quantitative \nRPR titer (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ... ), useful to follotreatment \nresponses. \ncl If both RPR and FTA-ABS are positive, syphilis is \nconfirmed. Prior syphilis history and current symptoms \nare taken into account to decide whether and hoto \ntreat the patient. \ne. IfRPR is positive and FTA-ABS is negative, the results \nare presumed to be a false positive. \n3. Reverse algorithm fur diagnosis of syphilis (Figure S-9) \na. Larger labs use the reverse sequence syphilis algorithm \nbecause it is much less time-consuming for a large \nnumber of screenings. \nb. An initial treponemal test easily automated (TP-EIA) is \nperformed first. \nc. IfTP-EIA is negative, syphilis is ruled out. \ncl IfTP-EIA is positive, a nontreponemal test (RPR) is \nperformed. If RPR is positive, the lab determines the \nquantitative RPR titer. \ne. If RPR is negative, a second treponemal test ( T pa/JiJum \nparticle agglutination) is performed. \n If only the initial TP-EIA is positive, it is most likely a \nfalse-positive. \ng. If two tests are positive (TP-EIA plus either RPR or \nT pallidum particle agglutination), the patient has \nevidence of either current or past syphilis.

His chief \ncomplaints are cough and fever lasting for 4 days. \n~ \nWhat f& the differential dlagnoele of cough \n1~JI\"' and fever fn HIV-positive patients? Howould \nyou frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe most common pneumonias in HN-infected patients are \nbacterial pneumonia, PJP, and pulmonary TB. Taken together, \nthey account for 91 % of pulmonary infections in HN-positive \npatients. Three pivotal features aid in the diagnosis of these com-\nmon pneumonias in HIV-infected persons. First, the CD4TL \ncount gauges the level of immunocompromise. Virulent infec-\ntions, such as pulmonary TB or bacterial pneumonia, may occur \nin patients with any CD4TL count. On the other hand, less viru-\nlent infections, such as PJP, are seen almost exclusively in patients \nwith CD4TL < 200 cells/mcL. \nThe second pivotal feature is that certain diseases present acutely \n(bacterial pneumonia}. but other diseases present subacutely or \nchronically (pulmonary TB or PJP). \nThe final pivotal feature that aids in the diagnosis of these com-\nplaints is the pattern on chest radiograph. Lobar infiltrates suggest \nbacterial pneumonia, whereas diffuse or interstitial infiltrates are \nseen in PJP and TB. Patterns that suggest pulmonary TB include \napical or cavitary infiltrates (if CD4TL > 200 cells/mcL}, hilar \nlymphadenopathy, or nodular infiltrates. The chest radiographic \npattern in pulmonary TB varies depending on the patient's degree \nof immunosuppression. Table 5-4 summarizes the typical CD4TL \ncount, acuity, and chest radiographic pattern and approach to \npulmonary infection in HN-positive patients. \nTumors may also cause pulmonary complaints. Not surpris-\ningly, aggressive neoplasms, such as lung cancer, may occur at any \nCD4TL count, whereas pulmonary lymphoma usually develops in \npatients with CD4TL counts< 500 cells/mcL, and Kaposi sarcoma \nusually develops in patients with CD4TL < 200 cells/mcL. \nAs noted above, the most common pneumonias in HN-infected \npatients are bacterial pneumonia, PJP and pulmonary TB. PJP is \nreviewed in Chapter 10 and will be mentioned here only briefly. \nThere are a large number of less common causes of pneumonia \nin HIV-infected patients that will not be reviewed here including \nendemic or geographically limited fungi (blastomycosis, coccid-\nioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis), opportunistic fungi (crypto-\ncoccosis and, in late AIDS, aspergillosis}, uncommon bacterial \npathogens (Nocardia, Rhodococcus equi, M kanasii') and CMV. \nThe remainder of this section will focus on bacterial pneumonia, \npulmonary TB, and M avium infection in HN-infected patients. \nDifferential Diagnosis of Pulmonary \nProcesses in Patients with HIV \nA.

Fungal infections (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, \ncryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and aspergillosis) \n2. CMV: when found in bronchoalveolar lavage culrurc, it \nusually reflects asymptomatic reactivation rather than the \netiology of pneumonia, although CMV is occasionally \nresponsible for pneumonia in advanced AIDS. \n3. Nonruberculous mycobacteria, especially MAI and \nM kansasii \n4. Kaposi sarcoma \nPATIENT \nMr. L reports that he was feeli~ well until 4 days ~o when \nhe developed the sudden onset of fever 38.8\"C, cough pro-\nductive of green sputum. and right-sided chest pain with \nInspiration. He feels moderately short of tJreath with exer-\ntion. Medical history is remarkal:7le for sexually acquired HIV \ninfection diagnosed 2 years ago. His last CD4TL cell count \n1 month ago was 400 cells/mcL. At that time, his viral load \nwas undetectal:11e. He Is compliant with ART. \n~ \nAt this point, what is the leading hypothesis, \n1~r what al'fJ the active altematlve9, and 19 \nthere a must not miss diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential dlagno9l9, what teets ehould '7e \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThere are 2 key features to Mr. L's presentation. The first pivotal \nfeature is that his CD4TL count is only moderately reduced. \nThis makes a variety of Ols unlikely (PJP, MAI, CMV, and \ncryptococcosis). On the other hand, pulmonary TB, bacte-\nrial pneumonia, and blastomycosis are sufficiently virulent to \npresent in patients with normal or mildly impaired immune sys-\ntems. The second pivotal feature is the rapid development of the \npulmonary process, which strongly favors bacterial pneumonia \nover pulmonary TB. The differential diagnosis is summarized \nin Table 5-5. \nPATIENT \nPhysical exam reveals temperature, 38.6\"C; BP. 120/75 mm \nHg; HR. 110 bpm: RR. 18 breaths per minute.

Bacterial infection is the most common cause of pneumonia \nassociated with HIV and AIDS. HIV should therefore be \nconsidered in any patient with severe or recurrent community-\nacquired pneumonia. \nB. Recurrent bacterial pneumonia (> 2 episodes within 1 year) is \nan AIDS-deflning condition. \nC. May occur at any time during course of HIV infection \nD. Risk of bacterial pneumonia increases as CD4TL count falls. \nID U further increases the risk. \n1. CD4U count \na. Rate of bacterial pneumonia in HIV-negative patients: \n0.9%/year \nb. Rate of bacterial pneumonia in HIV-positive patients \n(1) CD4TL > 500 cells/mcL: 2.3%/year \n(2) C04TL 200-500 cells/mcL: 6.8%/year \n(3) CD4TL < 200 cells/mcL: 10.8%/year \n(4) Two-thirds of cases in HIV-infected patients \ndeveloped in those with CD4U < 200 cells/mcL. \n2. IOU \na. Pneumonia incidence in HIV-infected patients who are \nIDUs is twice that in HIV-infected patients who are not \nID Us. \nb. Increased rate of septic emboli from infective endocarditis \ncontribute to the increased risk of pneumonia. \nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 95 \n3. ART significantly reduces the risk of bacterial pneumonia \n(45%). \nE. Etiology \n1. S pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial \npneumonia. Other common bacterial etiologies are \nH influem;ae; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Legionella; S auma, \nincluding community-acquired methiciJlin-resistant \nS aumu; and Pseud!Jmonas aeruginosa. \n2. S pneumoniae is associated with higher WBC than \nP aeruginosa (12,400/mcL vs 5000/mcL) and higher \naverage CD4TL count (106 cells/mcL vs 19 cells/mcL). \n3. P aeruginosa is the reported causative pathogen in up to \n38% of hospital-acquired pneumonias and 3-25% of \ncommunity-acquired pneumonias; it is associated with \n33% in-hospital mortality rate. \n4. Concomitant PJP is present in 13% of patients with \nbacterial pneumonia. \nF. Complications and prognosis \n1. Bacterial pneumonia progresses more rapidly and is more \noften complicated in HIV-infected persons than in Non-\nHIV infected persons. \n2. 30% of bacterial pneumonias are associated with bacteremia; \nbacteremia is more common with S pneumoniae. \n3. Among hospitalized patients, overall mortality is 9.3--27%. \na. 6-13 times higher mortality than general US population \n(and 1.2-2.4 times higher than population > 65 years) \nb. 5 predictors of mortality include septic shock, CD4TL \ncount< 100 cells/mcL, significant pleural effusion \n(extending beyond costophrenic angle), cavities and \nmultilobar infiltrates. Mortality is proportional to \nnumber of risk factors (Table 5-6). \nc. Mortality increases during influenza season. Influenza \ninfection may result in either severe influenza virus \npneumonia or bacterial pneumonia, most often due to \nS pneumoniae or S aureus. \nG. Pyogenic bacterial bronchitis with productive cough, fever, and \nabsence of infiltrates is more common in HIV-infected patients. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Initial evaluation \n1. Should include a chest radiogtaph, blood and sputum \ncultures, sputum Gram stain, and WBC \n2. Urinary pneumococcal and Legionella pneumophila \nserogtoup 1 Ag testing is performed routinely and often \nhelpful. \nTable 5-6. Mortality among HIV-positive patients with \nbacterial pneumonia. \nNa. Predictors' \nMortality [%) \n1.3 \n------- ----------------------\n7.5 \n------- ----------------------\n8.7 \n------- ----------------------\n34.5 \n------- ----------------------\n42.8 \n'Predictors: septic shock, CD41L count < 100/mcl., significant pleural effusion (extending \nbeyond costophrenic angle), cavities, and multilobar infiltrates. \n\n96 I CHAPTER 5 \nB. Airborne precautions should be followed in all HIV-infected \npatients with pneumonia. \n1. They should be placed in a negative-pressure isolation room. \n2. 3 sputum acid-fast stains should be done to rule out \npulmonary TB. \nC. Toxic appearance is uncommon but suggests bacterial \npneumonia over PJP or pulmonary TB (sensitivity, 10.6%; \nspecificity, 97.8%; LR+, 4.8) \nD. Pneumococcal pneumonia \n1. Common symptoms include cough (93%), subjective fever \n(90%), pleural pain (52-91%), and chills (74%); 51 % of \npatients have hemoptysis and 63% have temperature > 38C. \n2. The median duration of symptoms is 4 days. \n3. Sputum Gram stain is 58% sensitive and more frequently \npositive if collected within 24 hours of antibiotics. \n4. Sputum culture is 56% sensitive: the real pathogen is \nmore often isolated if sputum culture is performed before \nstarting antibiotics. When sputum culture is delayed \n> 24 hours after starting antibiotic, respiratory colonizers \nare more often isolated; for example, a respiratory sample \nobtained from a person with severe pneumonia caused \nby S pneumonuu who has been intubated in the ICU \nfor 48 hours may groP aeruginosa that colonizes the \nventilator tubing without causing pneumonia. \n5. Blood cultures are positive in 31-95%. \n6. Pneumococcal urinary Ag: =79% sensitive and 94% \nspecific (LR+, 13; LR-, 0.2). The test may be also be \npositive due to colonization or upper respiratory infections \nwith S pneumoniae. \nAntibacterial coverage should not be limited \nto S pneumoniae in HIV-infected patients \nwith pneumonia and a positive pneumococcal \nurinary Ag. \nE. Legionella pneumonia \n1. One srudy reported that certain findings were more \ncommon in patients with Legionella pneumonia than \nS pneumoniae, including extra-respiratory symptoms \n(57% vs 24%), hyponatrernia (57% vs 13%), and \ndevated creatine phosphokinase (57% vs 17%). \n2. Respiratory failure is more common with Legionella than \nS pneumoniae (33% vs 2%). \nF. M pneumoniae is usually diagnosed by IgM ELISA, 4-fold \nchange in IgG, or the presence of cold agglutination. \nG. Chest radiograph \n1. Standard imaging includes posteroanterior plus lateral chest \nradiograph. \n2. Typically demonstrates lobar or multifocal consolidation. \n3. Lobar consolidation is not always seen but strongly suggests \nbacterial pneumonia over PJP or pulmonary TB (sensitivity, \n54%; specificity, 90%; LR+, 5.6; LR-, 0.51). \n4. Lobar infiltrates in patients with fever for < 1 week strongly \nsuggests bacterial pneumonia (sensitivity, 48%; specificity, \n94%; LR+, 8.0; LR-, 0.55). \n5. Chest radiographic patterns did not distinguish \nS pneumoniae from P aeruginosa or Legionell.a infection. \n6. One report found that 82% of HIV-infected persons with \npulmonary complaints had abnormalities, including pleural \neffusions, cavities and abscess, on high-resolution CT scans \nthat were not detected on chest radiograph. \nHigh-resolution CT scanning should be \nconsidered for HIV-infected patients who do \nnot respond to therapy and for ill patients with \nrespiratory symptoms or signs but an unexpect-\nedly normal chest radiograph. \nH. Bronchoscopy \n1. Indicated in patients who do not respond to therapy or \nwhen concomitant infection is likely. \n2. Sensitivity of bronchoalveolar lavage for bacterial \npneumonia: 70% (if performed early) \nTreatment \nA. Prevention \nI. TMP-SMX PJP prophylaxis in patients with a CD4TL \ncount < 200 cdls/mcL also decreases the incidence of \nbacterial pneumonia by 67%. \n2. Pneumococcal vaccines \na. Two pneumococcal vaccines are recommended in \nHIV-infected persons: the 13-valent conjugated \npneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar-13) and the 23-valent \npolysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax). \nBoth decrease pneumococcal disease significantly, but \nthe combination is superior. \nb. The 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine \ncovers 86% of scrotypes but is not as immunogcnic as \nthe 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine. \nc. CDC recommends pneumococcal vaccine use as early \nas possible in HIV infection. \n(1) Vaccination should be ddayed 4 weeks in \nindividuals initiating ART to allofor immune \nreconstitution. \n(2) Usually, the more immunogenic conjugated \npneumococcal vaccine is administered first, and \nthe less immunogcnic polysaccharide vaccine \nis administered 2 months later, although it \nmay be preferable to wait for the latter until \nCD4 > 200 cells/ mcL. \nd. A polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine booster is \nrecommended every 5 years. A booster may also be useful \nin patients whose initial CD4TI is< 200 cells/mcL after \nsignificant immune reconstitution occurs (an increase of \nCD4TL > 100 cells/mcL). \n3. Therapy for typical bacterial pneumonia is usually initiated \nempirically. \n4. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with \nmarkedly increased monality in patients with shock. \n(85.7% compared with 25% with appropriate therapy). \n5. Antibiotics must cover common pathogens (S pneumoniae, \nS aureus, H influenzae, M pneumoniae, and P aeruginosa). \nLocal resistance patterns should be considered. \n6. A common strategy includes azithromycin and ceftriaxone. \n7. There should be a lothreshold for including anti-\nmethicillin-resistant S aureus coverage, particularly in \npatients with a history oflDU; patients undergoing \nhemodialysis; MSMs; and patients with severe, presumably \nbacterial, pneumonia during influenza season. \n8. Pseudomonas infection \n\na. Should be considered when the CD4TL is low. \nb. Treat with an antipseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotic \n(1) Piperacillin/cazobactam, ccfcpime, ccftazidime, \nmeropenem \n(2) Ceftazidime/avibactam or ceftolozane/cazobactam \nfor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa isolates \nc. An aminoglycoside (usually tobramycin) may be added \ninitially pending susceptibility data, but there is no \nbenefit of continuing tobramycin if Pseudomonas is \nsusceptible to the antipseudomonal beta-lactam. \n9. Patients with uncomplicated pneumonia have a time course \nof clinical and radiologic response to therapy similar to \nnon-HIV-infected persons. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nSerial sputum samples are sent for acid-fast bac!lli (AFB) \nsmear and culture. All AFB stains are negative. \n~ \nHave you c:ros66d a diagnostic: threshold for \n1~r ths leading hYf>OthHie, bac:tsrlal pnsumonla1 \nHave you ruled out the active alternatlvee1 \nDo other teete need to be done to exclude the \naltlllrnatlve dlagnoeee1 \nA critical decision at this point in the evaluation of an HIV-infected \npatient with pulmonary complaints is whether the patient needs \nbronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to establish the caus-\native pathogen. In HIV-positive patients with infiltrates, bron-\nchoalveolar lavage is highly sensitive (86%) if performed within \n24 hours of starting antibiotics. Transbronchial biopsy increases the \nsensitivity further but is rarely performed. Due to the large number \nof potential pathogens, empiric treatment for community-acquired \nbacterial pneumonia is often inappropriate except in the cases in \nwhich bacterial pneumonia is strongly suspected. Acute onset and \nfocal infiltrates suggest bacterial pneumonia whereas subacute/ \nchronic progression, diffuse infiltrates, and cavitary lesions sug-\ngest other etiologies. Bronchoscopy is often necessary in such cases \nunless sputum analysis is diagnostic {positive AFB or rarely positive \nsilver stain). Mr. L's acute illness, and focal findings on the chest \nradiograph strongly suggest bacterial pneumonia. You wonder if \npulmonary TB would present similarly in an HIV positive patient \nwith this CD4TL count. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Pulmonary \nTB in AIDS Patients1 \nTatbook Presentation \nPulmonary TB typically presents subacutdy with cough and fever \nthat have gone on for over a week (and often much longer) and sys-\ntemic symptoms of night sweats and weight loss are common. In \npatients with CD4TL > 200 cells/mcL, the chest radiographic pat-\ntern is similar to the one seen in non-HIV-infected patients--that is, \nwith apical, cavitary, or nodular infiltrates. In patients with CD4TL \n< 200 cells/mcL, the pattern on chest radiograph is often atypical: \nlower lobe infiltrates, miliary infiltrates, and lymphadenopathy are \nmore common. ExtrapulmonaryTB is also more common in AIDS. \n1TB in che non-HIV-infected patients is covered in Chapter 9, Cough, \nFever, and Respiratory Infections. \nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 97 \nDiseue Highlights \nA. There are currently more worldwide cases ofTB than at any \ntime in human history: per CDC data, in 2017, there were an \nestimated 10.0 million people with neTB and 1.3 million \nTB-related deaths worldwide. Latent TB infection affects a \nquarter of the world population. \nB. HIV-infected persons are at highest risk for TB (170 times \nhigher incidence). \n1. Risk increases further in patients from endemic areas and \namonglDUs. \n2. 9000 TB cases were reported in 2017 in the United States, \na 1.6% decrease from 2016. \nC. TB in tum increases both HIV replication and the risk of \ndeath. \nD. Worldwide, TB accounts for 30% of HIV-related deaths. \nE. Epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia \nF. 50% of cases secondary to recent infection (progressive \nprimary TB) \nG. TB may be the first manifestation of HIV infection and is an \nAIDS-defining illness. \n~ \nAll pti<nU with TB dtould h< t<t<d fot Hl\\T. \nH. Clinical characteristics \n1. Early HIV infection: pulmonary TB is fairly typical. \n2. Advanced HIV infection \na. Extrapulmonary TB more frequent \n(1) More common in the AIDS population (30%) than \nin patients without AIDS (15%) \n(2) Most common sites of c:xtrapulmonary TB include \nblood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, genitourinary \ntract, CNS, and liver. 19% of patients had cervical \nor supraclavicular lymph node involvement. \n(3) Other syndromes seen in these patients include \nweight loss, fever of unknown origin, and TB \nmeningitis. \nb. Chest radiographic pattern more frequently atypical \n(see below). \nExtrapulmonary TB is common in HIV-\ninfected patients and ex:trapulmonary sites of \ninfections may provide a target for diagnostic \nprocedures. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Prolonged fever (> 7 da}'ll) is more common in HIV-infected \npersons with pulmonary TB than in PJP or bacterial \npneumonia {sensitivity, 56%; specificity, 78%; LR+, 2.5; \nLR-, 0.57). \nB. Weight loss is also more common with pulmonary TB than \nwith PJP or bacterial pneumonia {sensitivity, 67%; specificity, \n68%; LR+, 2.1; LR-, 0.49). \nC. Standard tests in patients with suspected pulmonary TB \nshould include chest radiograph (with posteroanterior and lat-\neral views), 3 sputum AFB stains and cultures, PPD or IGRA, \nand blood and urine cultures. \n\n98 I CHAPTER 5 \nD. Chest radiography \n1. Certain radiographic findings, including cavitary lesions, \nhilar lymphadenopathy, and nodular lesions, are infrequent \nbut suggestive of pulmonary TB (Table 5-7). \nThe chest radiograph in HN-infected patients \nwith pulmonary TB may be typical or atypical. \nPulmonary TB should be considered in patients \nwith apical or cavitary disease, nodular infil-\ntrates, or lymphadenopathy. \n2. However, the radiographic manifestations of pulmonary \nTB vary with degree of immunosuppression (Table 5-8). \na. Early HN infection (CD4TI > 200 cells/mcL}: chest \nradiograph usually shows the typical reactivation \npattern: upper lobe disease or apical segment of lower \nlobe with or without cavitation. \nb. Advanced HN infection (CD4TI count < 200 cells/mcL): \n(1) Middle and lower lobe consolidation, lymph node \nenlargement, pleural effusions, and miliary patterns \nmore often seen. \n(2) Pleural involvement more common \n(a) Often accompanied by fever (85%), cough \n(77%), and chest pain (36%). Weight loss is \ncommon (74%). \n(b) Unilateral exudative effusion \n(c) Concomitant lower lobe parenchymal infiltrate \npresent in 44-73% \n~ \nPleural effusions without an infiltrat~ can be a \ny \nmanifestation ofTB in HN-infected patients. \n3. Cavitary lesions with night sweats or prolonged fever \n(> 7 days) not sensitive for pulmonary TB but highly \npredictive (sensitivity, 8-11 %; LR+, oo). \n4. Hilar lymphadenopathy with weight loss or with prolonged \ncough (> 7 days) was not sensitive fur pulmonary TB but \nhighly suggestive (sensitivity, 8%; LR+, 8--oo). \nTable 5-7.

Chest radiograph is normal in 10-21 % of patients with \npulmonary TB and advanced disease. \nPulmonary TB can be present despite a normal \nchest radiograph and should be considered \nin HN-positive patients with CD4TL \n< 200 cells/mcL and pulmonary symptoms. \nSuch patients require isolation in a negative-\npressure room. \nE. PPD and IGRA: sensitivity depends on the degree of \nimmunosuppression. \n1. CD4TL > 300 cells/mcL: 90% sensitive \n2. CD4TL < 100 cells/mcL: \na. PPD (~ 5 mm) 0% sensitive. \nb. IGRA test interpretation is complex in patients CD4TI \n< 100 cells/mcL. Most such patients have indeterminate \nIGRA results, which are not diagnostic. However, a \nnegative result makes the diagnosis ofTB less likely. \nF. Sputum analysis \n1. AFB smear results \na. Poor sensitivity (29-60%) is often due to the patient's \ninability to produce adequate sputum. Sensitivity is \n67% in patients able to produce adequate sputum. \nb. Specificity falls at lower CD4TL counts due to \nincreasing incidence of MAI but remains remarkably \nhigh in this group (92%). \n2. AFB culture: Sensitivity ranges from 43% to 100%. \nSensitivity approaches 100% in patients able to produce \nadequate sputum. \nG. Mycobacterium tubm:ul.osis PCR testing of sputum \n1. Helps distinguish pulmonary TB from MAI, M kansasii, \nor colonizing/contaminating nontuberculous mycobacteria \n(often Mycobactmum gordonae) \n2. Primarily used when AFB stains positive \n3. Particularly useful if suspicion of pulmonary TB is lo\na. Positive rapid tests help confirm pulmonary TB, \nnegative tests make pulmonary TB less likely \nb. 95% sensitive and specific in this situation \n4. Also useful when clinical suspicion is high and smear \nnegative \na. Rapid tests reported 53% sensitive, 93% specific. \nb. Positive tests suggest pulmonary TB \nc. Cultures still required to test drug susceptibility \n5. A diagnostic algorithm is shown in Figure 5-10. \nH. Blood culture fur mycobacteria \n1. Blood cultures are positive in 26--42% of HIV-positive \npatients with TB. \n2. Sensitivity increases to 49% in patients with CD4TL \n< 100 cells/mcL. \nI. Bronchoscopy \n1. Smear sensitivity: 50-57%; specificity: 99% in endemic \narea \n2. Culture sensitivity: nearly 100% \n3. Some studies report similar sensitivities to induced sputum. \n4. Bronchoscopy associated with increased transmission of \nM tuberculosis to medical personnel. Risk is minimal if \nbronchoscopy is performed in a negative-pressure room. \n\nAIDS/HIV INFECTION I 99 \nBlood culture, sputum AFB smear and culture, urine culture, PPD, chest radiograph \nHigh clinical suspicion \nLoclinical suspicion \n(+) \n(-) \n(+) \n(+) \nCulture and treat '-------'__;___--< \n(-) \nCulture and wait \nConsider \nbronchoscopy \nAFB, acid-fast bacillus; PPD, purified protein derivative; TB, tuberculosis. \nFigure 5-10.

Ifbronchoscopy is performed for suspected miliaryTB, \ntransbronchial biopsy is recommended. \nJ. Pleural evaluation \n1. Pleural fluid smear positive in 15% \n2. Culture of pleural fluid positive in 33-90% \n3. Sputum smear or culture in patients with pleural TB is \npositive in 33-50%. Sputum may be positive in patients \nwithout parenchymal infiltrate. \nObtain sputum for AFB stain and culture in \nHN-infected patients with pleural effusions, \neven in those without infiltrates \n4. Effusion is unilateral and exudative with lymphocyte \npredominance. \n5. Pleural biopsy \na. Positive smear: 44--69% \nb. Positive pathology (granuloma): 88% \nTreatment \nA. Chemoprophylaxis \n1. Indicated for HN-infected patients who have either a \npositive PPD (induration ~ 5 mm) or a positive IGRA; \nalso indicated for HIV-infected patients who have had a \nrecent and significant exposure to persons with infectious \npulmonary TB regardless of PPD/IGRA results \n2. A chest radiograph should be performed and the \npatient evaluated to rule out active TB (pulmonary or \ne:xtrapulmonary). In addition, even in patients with a \nnormal chest radiograph but CD4TL < 200 cells/mcL, \nsputum AFB stain and culture should be obtained. \n3. Isoniazid prophylaxis for 9 months decreases the rate of \nprogression from latent to active TB from 7.4% to 2.6% \nin HN-infected patients. \n4. Patients should be evaluated monthly to monitor adherence \nand side effects of therapy. \n5. lsoniazid liver toxicity \na. Elevation of transaminases in 10-20% of patients, but \nsymptomatic hepatitis much less common \n\n100 I CHAPTER 5 \nb. Isoniazid should be stopped if transaminase elevation \nexceeds 5x the upper limit of normal, even if the patient \nis asymptomatic. \nc. Patients with alcohol abuse, chronic liver disease, or \ncoinfection with hepatitis B or C virus should have \nmonthly liver biochemical tests to rule out isoniazid-\ninduced hepatitis. All HIV-infected patients are at \nhigher risk for hepatotoxicity (NASH, drug adverse \neffects) and should receive monthly liver biochemical \ntests. \n6. Rifampin prophylaxis for 4 months is an alternative when \nisoniazid cannot be used or to shorten the duration of \nprophylaxis; however, drug interactions have to be carefully \nreviewed. Adverse effects include hepatitis, blood dyscrasias, \nrash, and hypersensitivity. \n7. Recently rifapentine plus isoniazid weekly for 12 weeks has \nbecome an acceptable alternative for HN-infected patients \nwith latent TB infection. \nB. ActiveTB \n1. Active TB is usually treated with rifabutin, isoniazid, \npyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE). If the isolate \nis susceptible to rifampin and isoniazid, ethambutol is \nstopped. After 2 months of therapy, pyrazinamide \nis stopped. Rifabutin and isoniazid are continued to \ncomplete 6 months of therapy. \n2. Treating TB in HIV is complicated by clinically \nimportant drug interactions; consultation is \nrecommended. Rifampin is rarely used in HIV-\ninfected patients in the United States because rifabutin \ninteractions are easier to manage. Unfortunately, \nrifabutin is expensive and not used extensively in \nlow-income countries. \n3. Directly-observed therapy is recommended for all patients \nwith active TB, including HN-positive patients. \na. Decreases relapse rate from 20% to 5% \nb. Decreases development of multidrug-resistant TB from \n6% to 1% \n4. Monthly follow-up sputum cultures are obtained: if the \n2-month culture remains positive, treatment is extended \nfrom 6 to 9 months. \n5. Multidrug resistance is a major health problem. \na. Definitions \n(1) Drug-resistant TB is resistant to any of the flrst-\nline drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, or \nethambutol). \n(2) Multidrug-resistant TB is defined as resistance to \nboth rifampin and isoniazid. \n(3) Extensively drug-resistant TB is defined as \nresistance to rifampin, isoniazid, fluoroquinolones \n(ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin) and one \nof the injectable second-line antituberculous drugs \n(capreomycin and aminoglycosides). \n(4) Drug-resistant TB is more common in HN \npatients, but multidrug-resistant TB is uncommon \nin the United States. \nb. Drug-resistant TB arises in nonadherent patients. \nc. Suspect drug-resistant TB in patients with prior \nTB treatment, contact with known multidrug-\nresistant TB, or immigrants from countries where \nmultidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant TB \nis prevalent. \nd. Case fatality rate is high in patients with multidrug \nresistant or extensively drug-resistant TB and HIV. \ne. Multidrug-resistant TB typically requires 5 to 6 drugs, \nincluding 3 drugs to which TB is susceptible. Expertise \nin treating multidrug-resistant TB is required. Therapy \nis recommended for at least 2 years. Surgical resection \nof localized disease is required in some patients. \nC. IRIS and pulmonary TB \n1. Infiltrates worsen in 36% of patients upon institution of \nART due to immunologically mediated reactions (ie, IRIS). \n2. Increasing fever, infiltrates, and adenopathy may be seen. \n3. A second OI, poor adherence, drug resistance, or lo\npotency ofTB regimen needs to be excluded. \n4. IRIS is usually self-limited with pulmonary TB, but more \nsevere reactions benefit &om corticosteroids. \nD. BCG \n1. BCG is a live-attenuated Mycohacterium bovis strain with \nlimited efficacy: it may prevent TB meningitis and miliary \nTB, but does not prevent the more common presentations \nof primary or reactivation TB. \n2. BCG is contraindicated in HN-positive patients due to \nincreased incidence of active infection or dissemination of \nthe BCG strain. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. L's acute presentation and chest radl09raph SL.19gest \nbacterial pneumonia. PJP and MAC are unllkely given his \nhigh CD4TL count. Similarly, pulmonary TB would be unlikely \nwith such an acute presentation. Furthermore. at t his \nCD4 TL level, pulmonary TB would be expected to present \nmore typically (ie, wit h upper lobe or apical segment of lower \nlobe disease). The LR+ of bacterial pneumonia given the \nacuity of symptoms and lobar Infilt rate Is 8.0. Therefore, \nempiric therapy for bacterial pneumonia would be appropri-\nate. Bronchoscopy should be performed if Mr. L does not \nrespond promptly to antibiot ic therapy to rule out an alter-\nnative diagnosis like blastomycosls. \nMr. L is given ce~riaxone (a third-generation cepha-\nlosporin) and azithromycin.

This chapter fucuses \non the approach to isolated anemia, although a brief list of causes of \npancytopenia appears in Figure 6-1. The first step in determining the \ncause of anemia is to identify the general mechanism of the anemia \nand organize the mechanisms using a pathophysiologic framework; \nA. Aatte blood lou: this is generally clinically obvious. \nB. Underproduction of RBCs by the bone marrow; chronic \nblood loss is included in this category because it leads to iron \ndeficiency, which ultimately results in underproduction. \nC. Increased destruction of RBCs, called hemolysia. \n~ \nPatients should always be assessed for signs and \ny \nsymptoms of acute blood loss. \nA. Signs of acute blood loss \n1. Hypotcnsion \n2. Tachycardia \n3. Large ecchymoses \nB. Symptoms of acute blood loss \n1. Hematemesis \n2. Melena \n3. Rectal bleeding \n4. Hematuria \nS. Vaginal bleeding \n6. Hemoptysis \nAfter excluding acute blood loss, the next pivotal step is to dis-\ntinguish underproduction from hemolysis by checking the rcticu-\nlocytc count: \nA. Loor normal rcticulocytc counts arc seen in underproduc-\ntion ancmias. \nB. High reticulocyte counts occur when the bone marrois \nresponding normally to blood loss; hemolysis; or replacement \nof iron, vitamin B12, or fulatc. \nC. Rcticulocytc measures include: \n1. The .reticulocyte count: the percentage of circulating \nRBCs that arc reticulocytes (normally 0.5-1.5%). \n2. The absolute reticulocytc count; the number of \nreticulocytes actually circulating, normally 25,000-75,000/ \nmcL (multiply the percentage of reticulocytes by the total \nnumber ofRBCs). \n3. The .reticulocyte production inda (RPI) \na. Corrects the reticulocytc count fur the degree of anemia \nand for the prolonged peripheral maturation of \nreticulocytes that occurs in ancmia. \n(I) Normally, the first 3-3.5 days of reticulocytc \nmaturation occurs in the bone marroand the last \n24 hours in the peripheral blood. \n(2) When the bone marrois stimulated, reticulocytes \narc rdeascd prematurdy, leading to longer maruration \ntimes in the periphery, and larger numbers of \nreticulocytes arc present at any given time. \n(3) For an HCT of25%, the peripheral blood \nmaturation time is 2 days, and for an HCT of 15%, \nit is 2.5 days; the value of2 is generally used in the \nRPI calculation. \nb. RPI = observed rellclioc/l8% x (Patient HCT /45) \nper1pheral blood matnllon lime kl days \nc. The normal RPI is about 1.0. \nd. However, in patients with ancmia, RPI < 2.0 indicates \nunderproduction; RPI > 2.0 indicates hemolysis or an \nadequate bone marroresponse to acute blood loss or \nreplacement of iron or vitamins. \nThe first steps in evaluating anemia are looking \nfur acute blood loss and checking the RPI in \npatients who are not acutely bleeding. \nAfter determining the general mechanism, the next step in diag-\nnosing the cause of anemia is to determine the cause of the under-\nproduction or increased destruction. Traditionally, the differential \ndiagnosis fur underproduction ancmia is framed using the cell size. \nWhile this is a useful way to organize the differential, and may at \ntimes provide useful clues, it is important to keep in mind that the \nmean corpuscular volume (MCV) is not specific and should not be \nused to rule in or rule out a specific cause of anemia. \n~ \nUse the MCV to organize your thinking, not \ny \nto diagnose the cause of an ancmia. \n\n106 I CHAPTER 6 \nAnemla \nCheck WBC, platelet count, smear \nPancytopenia \nYes \nBone marrodysfunction: \n.erl.marx (aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, \nmyeloflbrosls, leukemla, lymphoma) \n.----------1~ 5econdaey (aplastic anemia, malignant \nInfiltration, hypersplenlsm, B12 deficiency, \nacute alcohol Intoxication, tuberculosis, \nsarcoidosis, SLE, overwhelming infection) \nAnemia+ \nth rombocytopenia \nMicroangiopathic (DIC, TTP, HUS, HELLP, \nAPLS, medicstions, mechanical valves, \nmalignant hypertension) \nAutoimmune (Idiopathic, SLE, \nlymphoproliferative disorders) \nHypersplenlsm \nHIV \n(1) Check the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) \ntest to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic \nanemia \n<2 \nIncreased \n1---------- destruction 1-------1~ \nhemolysis \n(2) Look for schistocytes on the smear to \ndiagnose macro- or microangiopathic \nhemolytic anemia \n(3) If both negative, consider other causes \nof hemolytlc anemla: \nHeredltacy \nUnderproduction \nSickle cell, spherocytosis, G6PD \nAcquired \nHypersplenism \nDrug-induced \nInfection, Toxin \nMCV<80 mcm3 \nMCV >100 mcm3 \nAbnormality \nidentified \nTreat \nLoferritin, \n% saturation \nIron deficiency: \ntreat and \ndetermine source \nMCV 80-100 mcm3 \n(1) Ask about exposures \nNondiagnostic \nto lead, zinc, copper \n>------=----~ (2) Look for diseases \nfrom the macrocytic, \nnormocytic lists \nFerritin normaVhigh, MCV < 75 mcm3, \nHb > 1 O gldL, RBC normaVhigh \nThalassemla \nLoferritin, \n% saturation \nIron deficiency: \ntreat and detennine \nsource \nB12, folate \ndeficiency \n~ \nNo abnormalities \nfound \nLook for iron deficiency, \ndiseases from the \nnormocytlc list \nInitial tests \nnondiagnostic \nB12 borderline lo\n.___ _ __.

Symptoms in chronic anemia are due to decreased oxygen \ndelivery to the tissues. \n1. Fatigue is a common but not very specific symptom. \n2. Dyspnea on exertion often occurs. \n3. Exertional chest pain occurs most often in patients with \nunderlying coronary artery disease or severe anernia or both. \n4. Palpitations or tachycardia can occur. \n5. Edema is sometlmes seen. \na. It is due to decreased renal blood floleading to \nneurohormonal activation and salt and water retention, \nsimilar to that seen in heart failure. \nb. However, in contrast to the locardiac output seen in \npatients with heart failure, the cardiac output in patients \nwith anemia is high. \n6. Mild anemia is often asymptomatic. \nB.

Palmar crease pallor has an LR+ of7.9. \nE. Pallor dsewhere (facial, nail bed) is not as useful, with LR+ < 5. \nF. No physical sign rules out anemia. \nG. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the physical exam for \nanemia is about 70%. \nOrder a CBC if patients have symptoms that \nsuggest anemia, even without physical exam \nsigns, or if you observe conjunctiva! rim or pal-\nmar crease pallor. \n\n108 I CHAPTER 6 \n\nMr5. f'i5 inttial laborator)' te5t re5ult5 5hoa WBC of \n7100/mcl, RBC of 2.6 mlllion/mcl, Hl:10f 6.7 g/dl, HCT of \n23.3%, and MCV of 76 mcm3  Her platelet count i5 normal. \nA CBC 6 month5 ago 5howed an Hb of 12 g/dl. HGT of 36%. \nand MCV of 82 mcm3 . \nAt this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the aGtlve altematlvee, and Is \nttwsre a must not mlH diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnosis, what teete should 17e \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe first step is to determine the mechanism of Mrs. Ifs anemia. \nMrs. A is not having any symptoms or signs of acute blood loss. \nShe does have diseases associated with chronic blood loss: reflux \npossibly causing esophagitis and occasional menorrhagia. However, \nit is not possible to distinguish underproduction from hemolysis \nbased on the history. Although the change in her CBC tdls you a \nneprocess is going on, it also does not distinguish between these \n2 mechanisms. The first pivotal point will be her reticulocyte count. \n\nAlways look at previous CBC results to see if \nthe anemia is new, old, or progressive. \nMr5. f'i5 reticulocyte count i5 1.5%, which i5 an ab5olute \nretlculocyte count of 54,000/mcl, and an RPI of 0.39. \nNothat you have found that Mre. A has an \nunderproduGtion a nemia, what ie the leading \nhypotheele, what are the active altematfvee, \nand Is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given \nthle differential dlagnoels, what teets ehould \nl7e ordered? \nMrs. Ks MCV is 76 mcm3, so you should consider the differ-\nential diagnosis for microcytic anemia. However, it is important to \nkeep in mind that the MCV is not specific and should not be used \nto rule in or rule out a specific cause of anemia. \nA. In one study, normal MCVs were found in 50% of patients \nwith abnormal serum vitamin B12, folate, or iron studies. \n1. 5% of patients with iron deficiency had high MCVs \n2. 12% of patients with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency had \nlowMCVs \nB. What about the rest of the CBC? Do the other indices hdp? \nI. Other red cd1 indices (mean corpuscular hemoglobin \n[MCH] and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration \n[MCHC]) tend to trend with the MCV and are not \npartic:ularly sensitive or specific. \n2. The red cell distribution width (RDW) is also not sensitive \nor specific in identifying the cause of an anemia. \nDespite this caveat about the MCV, in a patient with a micro-\ncytic anemia and symptoms suggesting possible chronic blood \nloss, iron deficiency is by far the most likely cause, with a pretest \nprobability of 80%. Therefore, the leading hypothesis for Mrs. A \nis iron deficiency anemia. Anemia of inflammation, by virtue of \nTable6-1. Diagnostic hypotheses for Mrs. A. \nDiagnostic \nHypotheses \nDemographics, Risk \nFactors, Symptoms \nand Signs \nLeading Hypothesis \n-----------------------------------\nIron deficiency \nPica \nBlood loss (menorrhagfa, \nmelena, hematochezia, \nNSAIDuse) \n-----------------------------------\nActln Altematln-Most Common \n--------------------------------\nAnemia \nof chronic \ninflammation \nHistory of kidney or liver \ndisease, inflammation, \ninfection, malignancies \n--------------------------------\nOther Hypotheses \n-----------------------------------\nThalassemia \nEthnic background \n-----------------------------------\nLead poisoning \nExposure to lead \n-----------------------------------\nB12 deficiency \nDiet (especlal ly vegan) \nOther autoimmune \ndiseases \nElderly \nNeurologic symptoms \nFolate deficiency \nPregnancy \nSickle cell anemia \nAlcohol abuse \nStarvation \nImportant Tests \nSerum ferritin \nTransferrln \nsaturation \n---------------- \nIron, TIBC, ferritin, \ncreatinine. \ntransaminases, \nESR,CRP \nHb electrophoresis, \nDNA testing \nLead level \n812 level \nHomocystelne level \nMMA \nFolate level \nHomocysteine level \nCAP.

Sideroblastic anemia and \nlead exposure are other hypotheses. Thalassemia is excluded by \nthe recently normal CBC. Because the MCV lacks specificity, \nthe causes of normocytic and macrocytic anemia also need to be \nkept in mind as other hypotheses. Table 6-1 lists the differential \ndiagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: Iron Deficiency Anemia \nTatbook Presentation \nThe most classic presentation would be a young, menstruating \nwoman who has fatigue and a craving for ice. Typical presentations \ninclude fatigue, dyspnea, and sometimes edema. \nDisease Hi.ghligb.ts \nA. The CBC varies with the degree of severity of the iron deficiency. \nI. In very early iron deficiency, the CBC is normal, although \nthe ferritin is already decreasing. \n2. A mild anemia then develops, with an Hb of9-12 g/dL, \nand normal or slightly hypochromic RBCs. \n3. As the iron deficiency progtesses, the Hb continues to \ndecrease, and hypochromia and microcytosis develop. \nB. Causes of iron deficiency \nI. Blood loss, most commonly menstrual or GI \n\n2. Malabsorption \na. May be seen in patients with celiac disease, Helicobacter \npylori infection, or inflammatory bowel disease \nb. May occur after some bariatric surgery procedures \nc. May also occur in patients taking proton pump \ninhibitors or H 2-blockers \n3. Inadequate intake, typically found in resource-poor settings \nor in people on restricted diets \na. Males need 1 mg/day (need to consume 15 mg/day; \nabsorption rate 6%). \nb. Females need 1.4 mg/day (need to consume 11 mg/day; \nabsorption rate 12%). \nc. Iron is more bioavailable from meat than vegetables. \n4. Increased demand, seen with pregnancy, infancy, \nadolescence, erythropoietin therapy \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Bone marroexam for absence of iron stores is the gold stan-\ndard but is rarely necessary. \nB. The serum fcrritin is the best serum test. \n1. The LR+ for a decreased serum ferritin is very high, with \nreports ranging from LR+ of 51 for a ferritin < 15 nglmL \nto a LR+ of 46 for a fcrritin < 30 ng/mL. \n2. Thus, a loferritin rules in iron deficiency anemia. \n3. In general populations, the LR- for a serum ferritin \n> 100 ng/mL is very lo(0.08). \n4. Thus, in general populations, a ferritin > 100 ng/mL \ngreatly reduces the probability the patient has iron deficiency. \n5. However, because ferritin is an acute phase reactant that \nincreases in inflammatory states, interpreting it in the \npresence of such illnesses is difficult. \na. There is a wide range of reported LRs, with many \nstudies finding ferritin is not helpful in diagnosing iron \ndeficiency in the presence of chronic illness. \nb. The level at which the serum ferritin suggests iron \ndeficiency is probably much higher in patients with \nchronic illness, but the level may vary depending on \nthe underlying illness. \nc. In chronic kidney disease, iron abnormalities are defined \nusing the transferrin saturation {serum iron/total iron-\nbinding capacity [Fe/TIBC]) and ferritin. \n(1) Absolute iron deficiency, due to dietary deficiency, \npoor absorption, GI or other bleeding: transfcrrin \nsaturation< 20%, ferritin < 100 ng/mL \n(2) Functional iron deficiency, due to impaired iron \ntransport to erythroblasts and inhibited intestinal \nabsorption: transferrin saturation < 20%, ferritin \n~ 100 nglmL \nC. Other tests \n1. The serum iron, MCV, transfcrrin saturation, red cell \nprotoporphyrin, red cell fcrritin, and RDW all are less \nsensitive and specific than ferritin. \n2. The best of these is transferrin saturation s 5%, with an \nLR+ of 10.46. \n3. Response to a therapeutic trial of iron replacement can also \nbe used to confirm the diagnosis in unclear cases. \nIn patients without chronic inflammatory dis-\neases, the scrum ferritin is the best single test to \ndiagnose iron deficiency anemia. \nANEMIA I 109 \nTreatment \nA. Iron deficiency anemia is generally treated with oral iron \nreplacement, with N iron therapy reserved for patients who \ndemonstrate malabsorption or who are unable to tolerate oral \niron. \nB. Transfusion is necessary only if the patient is hypotensive or \nactively bleeding; has angina, dizziness, syncope, severe dysp-\nnea or severe fatigue; or a very lohemoglobin < 7 g/dL. \nC. The best-absorbed oral iron is ferrous sulfate; the optimal dose \nis unclear but ranges from 15-150 mg of elemental iron every \n1-2 days (325 mg of iron sulfate contains 65 mg of elemental \niron). \nD. There can be significant GI side effects, including nausea, \nabdominal pain, and constipation; these can be reduced by \ntaking the iron with food, reducing the dose, or increasing the \ndosing interval; switching to N iron may be necessary. \nE. There should be an increase in reticulocytes 7-10 days after \nstarting therapy and an increase in Hb and HCT by 14 days. \nF. If there is no response, reconsider the diagnosis, keeping in \nmind that adherence with iron therapy is often low. \nG. It is necessary to take iron for 6 months in order to replete \niron stores, though Hb levels may return to normal by \n6-8 weeks. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nSince Mrs. A does not have any chronic, inflammatory diseases, \nthe most useful test at this point is a serum ferritin. Serum iron \nand TIBC are often ordered simultaneously but are not necessary \nat this point. \n\nYou reviethe history, looking for symptoms of bleeding \nor chronic Illness. She has no kidney or liver disease and no \nsymptoms of infection. Her ethnic background is Sea ndina-\nvian, making t halassemia unl!kely. You order a serum ferrltln, \nwhich is 5 ng/mL. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nWith a pretest probability of 80% and an LR+ of 51 for \nthis level of ferritin, Mrs. A is clearly iron deficient . It is not \nnecessary to test for any other causes of anemla, but It ls \nnecessary to determine why she Is iron deficient. \nAlways look for a source of blood loss in iron \ndeficiency ancmia. Be alert for occult GI \nmalignancies. \nIron deficiency is almost always due to chronic blood loss and \nrarely due to poor iron intake or malabsorption of iron; menstrual \nand GI blood loss are the most common sources. Because GI blood \nloss can be occult, many patients need GI evaluations. \nA. Which patients with iron deficiency need a GI workup? (also \nsee Chapter 19, GI Bleeding) \n1, All men, all women without menorrhagia, and women over \nage 50 even with menorrhagia. \n\n110 I CHAPTER 6 \n2. Women under age 50 with menorrhagia do not need \nfurther GI evaluation, unless they have GI symptoms or a \nfamily history of early colon cancer or adenomatous polyps. \n3. Always ask carefully about minimal GI symptoms in young \nwomen, since celiac disease often causes iron deficiency \ndue to malabsorption, and the symptoms can easily be \nattributed to irritable bowel syndrome. \nIt is unclear from Mrs. Ns history whether the menorrhagia is \nsufficient to cause this degree of iron deficiency anemia. In addition, \nshe has upper GI symptoms of anorexia and reflux. Therefore, you \norder an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which shows severe \nreflux esophagitis and also gastritis. Further history reveals she has \nbeen using several hundred milligrams of ibuprofen daily for several \nweeks because of a back. strain. The severe esophagitis and gastritis \nare sufficient to explain her anemia. Although she has no lower GI \nsymptoms or family history of colorectal cancer, the American Gas-\ntroenterological Association recommends performing a colonoscopy. \nFOLLOW-UP OF MRS. A \n\nMrs. A stopped the 11:7uprofen, sul:15tltuted a proton pump \ninhibitor for the H2 -blocker, anc:I completed 6 months of \niron therapy. She folt fine. A follow-up CBC showed an Hb of \n13 g/dL. an HGT of 39%, and a s~nif!cantly elevated MCV \nof122 mcm3. \nAt th'9 point, what le the leac:llng hypatheele, \nwhat are the active alternatives, and Is \nthere a muet not mf99 diagnoele? Given thfe \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests should be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAlthough Mrs. A is not anemic now, she has a marked macro-\ncytosis. The approach to isolated macrocytosis is the same as the \napproach to macrocytic anemia. The degree of macrocytosis is \nnot a reliable predictor of the cause, but in general, the higher the \nMCV. the more likely the patient has a vitamin B1z or folate defi-\nciency. The pretest probability of vitamin deficiency with an MCV \nof 115-129 mcm3 is 50%, and nearly all patients with an MCV \n> 130 mcm3 will have a vitamin deficiency. \nB1z deficiency is seen more often than folate deficiency in oth-\nerwise healthy people, and so is the leading hypothesis, with folate \ndeficiency being the active alternative. Use of antirnetabolite drugs \nis excluded by history. Causes of nonmegaloblastic anemias need \nto be considered next. Hypothyroidism would be the most lik.ely \nother hypothesis, with liver disease and alcohol abuse less lik.ely \nbased on her lack. of a previous history of either. Hemolysis causing \nreticulocytosis is unlikely since she is not anemic. Table 6-2 lists the \ndifferential diagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: 812 Deficiency \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is an elderly woman with marked anemia \nand neurologic symptoms such as paresthesias, sensory loss (espe-\ncially vibration and position), and ataxia. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. It takes years to develop this deficiency because of extensive \nstores of vitamin B12 in the liver. \nTable 6-2.

Anemia and macrocytosis are not always present. \n1. In 1 study, 28% of patients with neurologic symptoms due \nto B1z deficiency had no anemia or macrocytosis; another \nstudy found that up to 84% of patients with B1z deficiency \nmay be missed if B12 levels are checked only in patients \nwith macrocytosis. \n2. In another study, the following clinical characteristics were \nfound in patients with B1z deficiency: \na. 28% were not anemic \nb. 17% had a normal MCV \nc. 17% had leukopenia, 35% thrombocytopenia, 12.5% \npancytopenia \nd. 25% of patients had glossitis \nc. 36% had neuropsychiatric symptoms \n(1) Paresthesias occur initially, followed by ataxia with \nloss of vibration and position sense. \n(2) Neuropsychiatric symptoms can progress ro severe \nweakness, spasticity, clonus, paraplegia, fecal and \nurinary incontinence. \n(3) Delirium and dementia can occur. \n~ \nTho CBC \"\"ho norm.I in B., ddlcionoy. \nC. Intramedullary hemolysis can occur, leading to an increased \nlactate dehydrogenase (LD) and decreased haptoglobin. \nD. B1z absorption requires normal gastric and intestinal function. \n1. Dietary B12 is protein bound and is released by acid peptic \ndigestion in the stomach. \n2. Although intrinsic factor is made by the parietal cells of the \ngastric body and fundus, it does not bind to B12 until both \nreach the jejunum. \n3. The B12-intrinsic factor complex binds to receptors in the \nterminal ileum, where B12 is absorbed. \n\nE. The most common c:auses of B12 deficiency are food-cobalamin \nmalabsorption, lack of intrinsic factor, and dietary ddkienc:y; \nother c:auses of malabsorption are less common. \n1. Dietary deficiency is rare unless the patient follows a vegan \ndiet. \n2. Food-cobalamin malabsorption occurs when B1 is not \nreleased from food proteins due to impaired acid. peptic \ndigestion. \na. The B deficiency in this condition is often subclinical \nand attects up to 20% of older adults. \nb. It is c:aused by atrophic gastritis and ac:hlorhydria, which \nc:an be seen with chronic: H pylori infection, gastric: surgery, \nand long-term use of acid-suppressing drugs. \n3. Laclc of intrinsic factor is c:aused by \na. Gastrectomy (all patients with total gastrectomy and \n5% of patients with partial gastrectomy will become B12 \ndeficient) \nb. Pernicious anemia \n(1) An immunologically mediated gastric atrophy that \nleads to loss of parietal cells and a marked reduction \nin secretion of intrinsic: factor \n(2) Uncommon before age 30 \n(3) Seen most often in patients over age 50, with a \nmedian age at diagnosis of70-80 years \n(4) 25% of patients have a family history of pernicious \nanemia and 10% have autoimmune thyroid disease. \n4. B12 deficiency can also be c:aused by malabsorption in the \nterminal ileum due to surgical removal or bypass, Crohn \ndisease, celiac disease, or bacterial overgrowth \nS. Sometimes drugs interfere with B12 absorption, most notably \nmetformin, proton pump inhibitors, colc:hicine, ethanol, \nand neomycin. \n6. Blind loop syndrome c:an c:ause B12 deficiency due to \nutilization ofB12 by the bacteria. \n7. Malabsorption may rarely be due to congenital disorders, \nsuch as transcobalamin II deficiency. \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Determining whether a patient is B12 deficient is more compli-\ncated than it seems. \n1. B12 levels c:an be falsely loin folate deficiency, pregnancy, \nand oral contraceptive use. \n2. B12 levels can be falsely normal in myeloproliferative \ndisorders, liver disease, and bacterial overgrowth syndromes. \n3. The sensitivity of a B12 level< 200 pg/mL for proven clinical \nB12 deficiency is 65-95%; the spedflcity is 60-80%. \nB. B12 is a cofactor in the conversion of homot:y5teine to methi-\nonine, and of methmalonyl CoA (MMA) to succinyl CoA. \n1. Consequently, in B12 defkiency, the levels of homot:y5teine \nand MMA increase. \n2. Therefore, another way to diagnosis B1.2 deficiency is to \nmeasure homot:y5teine and MMA levels. \na. In addition to B1f deficiency, MMA can be elevated in \nchronic kidney disease and hypovolemia. \nb. The sensitivity of MMA > 400 nmol/L for the diagnosis \nof B12 deficiency is 98%; modest elevations in the \n300-700 nmol/L range can be seen in chronic kidney \ndisease. MMA > 1 OOO nmol/L is highly specific for B12 \ndeficiency. \nANEMIA I 111 \nc. Homot:y5teine can be elevated in folate or pyridoxine \ndeficiency, chronic kidney disease, hypovolemia, and \nhypothyroidism. \ncl. The sensitivity ofhomocysteine ranges from 85% to \n96%; an elevated homocysteine is less specific than an \nelevated MMA. \nC. Response to therapy is another way to establish the presence of \nB12 deficiency. \n1. MMA and homocysteine normalize 7-14 days after the \nstart of replacement therapy. \n2. The reticulocyte count increases in 7-10 days, and the \nhemoglobin increases in 30 days. \nD. An algorithm for diagnosing B12 deficiency in patients with \nmacrocytic anemia \n1. B12 level < 100 pg/mL: deficiency present \n2. B12 level 100-350 pg/mL: c:heck MMA and homocysteine \nlevels \na. If both normal, deficiency unlikely \nb. If both elevated, deficiency present \nc. If MMA alone elevated, deficiency present \ncl. If homocysteine alone elevated, possible deficiency \n3. B12 > 350 pg/mL: deficiency unlikely \nTreatment \nVery loor very high B12 levels are usually \ndiagnostic. \nPatients with neurologic symptoms consistent \nwith B12 deficiency should have MMA and \nhomocysteine levels checked even if the B12 \nlevel is lonormal. \nA. IM cobalamin, 1 OOO mcg weekly for 6-8 weeks, and then \nmonthly \nB. Can also use oral cobalamin, 1000-2000 mcg daily \n1. Oral cobalamin is absorbed by a second, nonintrinsic \nfactor-dependent mechanism that is relatively inefficient. \n2. Patients with dietary deficiency and food-cobalamin \nmalabsorption can be treated with lower doses of oral B12 \n3. Randomized trials have shown that oral and intramuscular \nreplacement are equally effective, even in patients with \npernicious anemia or gastrectomies. \nC. Sublingual and intranasal formulations are available but have \nnot been extensively studied. \nD. Lifelong treatment is needed, unless the c:ause of deficiency \ncan be corrected. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr5. l\\5 B 12 level 15 21 P9/mL. with a 5en.Jm folate af 8.0 ng/mL \n(normal 4.0-26.0 ng/mL). \nHave you cros5Bd a dlagnoetlc threshold for \nthe leadlng hypothBSle, 512 de&lency1 Have \nyou ruled out the active alternatives? Do \nother teete need to be done to e>eelude the \nalternative diagnoeee1 \n\n112 I CHAPTER6 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Folate Deficiency \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is an alcoholic patient with malnutrition \nand anemia. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Anemia and macrocytosis are the most common manifesta-\ntions; whether neurologic symptoms can occur is controversial. \nB. Most often caused by inadequate intake {especially in alco-\nholic patients) or increased demand due to pregnancy, chronic \nhemolysis, leukemia. \nC. Since absorption occurs in the jejunum, malabsorption is rare \nin the absence of bariatric surgery, short bowel syndrome, or \nbacterial overgrowth syndromes. \nD. Some drugs can cause folate deficiency, including methot:rexate, \nphenytoin, sulfualazine, and alcohol. \nE. Along with B12, folate is a cofactor for the conversion of \nhomocysteine to methionine, so homocysteine levels {but not \nMMA levds) increase in folate deficiency. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The sensitivity and specificity of scrum folate measurements \nfor the diagnosis of folate deficiency are not clear. \nB. Levels can decrease within a fedays of dietary folate restric-\ntion, or with alcohol use, even though tissue stores can be \nnormal; levels increase with feeding. \nC. Recent evidence suggests that RBC folate is not superior to \nserum folate for diagnosis of folate deficiency. \n~ \nDo not order red cd1 (RBC) folate to evaluate \n,,... folate deficiency. \nD. Elevated homocysteine is about 80% sensitive for the diagno-\nsis of folate deficiency; the specificity is unknown. \nE. A positive response to therapy is diagnostic. \nF. A patient with a normal scrum folate and no response to folate \nreplacement does not have folate deficiency. \nTreatment \nA. In patients with an acute deficiency, treat with 1 mg of folic \nacid daily for 1-4 months, or until there is complete hemato-\nlogic recovery. \n1. Never treat folate deficiency without determining whether \nthe patient is B12 deficient. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. L i5 a 70-year-old woman with a history of squa-\nmous cell carcinoma of the larynx, succes5fully treated \nwith surgery and radiation therapy 10 years ~o. She has \na tracheo5tomy and a jejunostomy tube. One week ago. \nshe fell and fractured her rl<:jht humeral head. On routine \npreoperative laboratory tests, her CBC was unexpectedly \n2. Folate replacement can correct hematologic abnormalities \nwhile worsening the neurologic symptoms specific to B12 \ndeficiency. \n~ \nAlways check for B12 deficiency in a patient with \n,,... folate deficiency. \nB. Patients with long-term increased demand, such as those \nwith sickle cd1 anemia, should take 1 mg of folk acid daily \nindefinitdy. \nC. Women who are trying to conceive and pregnant women \nshould take a prenatal vitamin containing at least 0.4 mg of \nfolic acid daily to prevent anencephaly. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. A'.s B12 level is diagnostic of B12 deficiency. She has \nno conditions associated with folate deficiency, so even \nthough the test characteristics of the serum folate are \nunclear, Jn this case, the normal level ls sufficient to rule out \nfolate deficiency. \nThe next step is to determine the cause of the B12 deficiency. \nA. Test for pernicious anemia by sending anti-intrinsic factor \nantibodies. \n1. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies have a sensitivity of \n95-100% and specificity of92-100% for the diagnosis of \npernicious anemia. \n2. LR+, 12; LR-, 0.05 \nB. Reviehistory for other symptoms of malabsorption suggest-\ning small bowel disease. \nC. Ask if the patient follows a vegan diet \nD. In older patients without other symptoms, negative anti-\nbodies, and adequate intake, consider food-cobalamin \nmalabsorption. \nE. The Schilling test is no longer considered helpful in diagnos-\ning the cause ofB12 deficiency. \nIt is not always possible to determine the site \nof malabsorption, and it is acceptable to treat \nsuch patients empirically with B12 replacement. \nabnonnal: WBC 11, 100/mcL (65% polymorphonuclear leu-\nkocytes, 12% bands, 4% monocytes, 19% lymphocytes). \nHb 8.7 g/dL, HCT 26.3%, MCV 85 mcm'; t he platelet count \nis nonnal.

Glvsn this dlffisrentlal \ndiagnosis, what tests should be orderet.11 \n\nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe relatively acute drop in HCT is a pivotal point that suggests \neither bleeding or hemolysis; these are also the \"must not miss\" \ndiagnoses. The usual causes of normocytic anemia need to be \nconsidered next. Anemia of inflammation (also called anemia of \nchronic disease) is a common cause of normocytic anemia, with \nbone marroinfiltration, and red cell aplasia being less common. \nYou should also consider the causes of microcytic and macrocytic ane-\nmia in your list of other hypotheses. Anemia is common in elderly \npatients, occurring in 10% of community-dwelling older adults. \nIn one study of patients over 65 referred to a hematology clinic \nfor evaluation of anemia, 25% had iron deficiency, 10% anemia \nof inflammation, 7.5% hematologic malignancies (including mye-\nlodysplastic syndrome), 4.6% thalassemia, 3.4% chronic kidney \ndisease, and 5.7% miscellaneous causes (including hypothyroid-\nism, B11 deficiency, hemolysis, alcohol, medication). A specific \ncause could not be identified in 44% of the patients. However, \nsince her anemia is acute, it is unlikely to be related solely to her \nage. Table 6-3 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nShe has felt feverish. with a coL.19 h prod uctlve of brown spu-\ntum. She has had no nausea or vomiting, no melena, and no \nhematochezla. She has been postmenopausal for a long \ntime and has had no vaginal bleeding. The orthopedic sur-\ngeon confirms it is un Ii kely that she has slg nificant bleeding \nat the fracture site. Her rectal exam shows brown, hemoc-\ncult-negatlve stool. Her chest radl09raph shows a neleft \nlower lobe pneumonia. \n~~ Is tha cllnlcal Information 5Ufflclent to make a \n,~r dlagnoels1 If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nThere are no symptoms or signs suggesting that she is having \nan active, acute episode of bleeding. The next steps are to look for \nhemolysis and, if hemolysis is not present, to then explore cause of \nnormocytic anemia. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nFurther laboratory testing shows a reticulocyte count of \n1.4% (RPI = 0.8). Her serum ferrltln Is 200 ng/mL. TSH. \nB, 2, and fola.te levels are all normal. \nHave you cros56d a diagnostic threshold for \nthe leading hypothHH, Iron deficiency and \nhemolysle1 Have you ruled out the active \naltemativse1 Do othar tsete need to l:Je done \nto exclude ths altsmatlvs dlagnOHe1 \nThe loRPI points toward an underproduction anemia, not \nhemolysis. The elevated serum ferritin substantially reduces the \nlikelihood that she is having occult blood loss leading to iron defi-\nciency, especially since she has no history of chronic inflamma-\ntory diseases. She does not have hypothyroidism, B11 deficiency, or \nfolate deficiency. She does not have pancytopenia, so bone marro\ninfiltration is unlikely. \nANEMIA I 113 \nTable 6-3.

Occurs in patients with acute or chronic immune activation \nB. Cytokines (interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor) \ninduce changes in iron homeostasis. \n1. Dysregulation of iron homeostasis \na. Increased uptake and retention of iron in \nreticuloendothdial system cells \nb. Limited availability of iron for erythropoiesis \n2. Impaired proliferation and differentiation of erythroid \nprogenitor cdls \n3. Blunted erythropoietin response \na. Production of erythropoietin inadequate for degree of \nanemia \nb. Progenitor cells do not respond normally \n4. Increased erythrophagocytosis leads to decreased RBC \nhalf-life \nC. Underlying causes of anemia of inflammation include \n1. Chronic kidney disease \na. In patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo \ndialysis, the anemia is due to lack of erythropoietin and \nmarked inflammation. \nb. In patients with lesser degrees of chronic kidney disease, \nthe anemia is caused primarily by lack of erythropoietin \nand anti-proliferative effects of uremic toxins. \n2. Autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus \nerythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, \nand inflammatory bawd disease \n3. Acute infections caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, \nor parasites \na. Can occur within 24-48 hours in acute bacterial \ninfections, with Hb usually in the 10-12 g/clL range \nb. Occurs in as many as 90% ofICU patients, accompanied \nby inappropriately mild devations of serum erythropoietin \nlevels and blunted bone marroresponse to endogenous \nerythropoietin, sometimes called \"anemia of critical \nillness\" \n4. Chronic infections caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, \nor parasites \n5. Cancer, either hematologic or solid tumor \nD. Some noninflammatory chronic diseases can also cause \nanemias. \n1. Endocrinopathies, such as Addison disease, thyroid disease, \nand panhypopituitarism can lead to mild chronic anemia. \n2. Liver disease can cause anemia. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. There is not a single test that proves or disproves a patient's \nanemia is from anemia of inflammation. \nB. Instead, there are several diagnostic tests that can possi-\nbly be done, sometimes simultaneously and sometimes \nsequentially. \nAn Hb of< 8 glclL suggests there is an addi-\ntional cause for the anemia, beyond the anemia \nof inflammation. \n1. Even in the presence of a disease known to cause anemia, it \nis important to rule out iron, B12, and folate deficiencies. \n2. The typical pattern of iron studies in anemia of \ninflammation is a loserum iron, loTIBC, lonormal \nto normal transferrin saturation, and elevated serum ferritin. \n3. MCV is usually normal but can be mildly microcytic. \n4, Erythropoietin levels will be loin chronic kidney disease \nand not appropriately elevated for the degree of anemia \nin inflammatory conditions; interpretation is difficult and \nmeasurement of the erythropoietin level is generally not \nuseful diagnostically. \n5. Pancytopenia suggests there is bone marroinfiltration or \na disease that suppresses the production of all cell lines. \n6. When you see pancytopenia, think about bone marro\ninfiltration, B12 deficiency, viral infection, drug toxicity, \nhypersplenism, overwhelming infection, systemic: lupus \nerythematosus, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute alcohol \nintoxication. \nTreatment \nBone marroexamination is necessary to \nestablish the diagnosis when pancytopenia is \npresent, serum tests are not diagnostic:, the ane-\nmia progresses, or there is not an appropriate \nresponse to empiric: therapy. \nA. Treat the underlying chronic disease, if possible. \nB. Indications for erythropoietin therapy and appropriate target \nHb levds are evolving; iron should be given to all patients \nbeing treated with erythropoietin. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nMrs. L has normal liver biochemical tests and a normal cre-\natlnfne. Her Iron studies shoa serum Iron of 25 mcg/dL, \nwith a TIBC of 140 mcg/dL (%saturation= 18%). \nMrs. L has a very loRPI, ruling out hemolysls. She has \nno signs of bleeding, and Iron st udies are consistent with \nan anemla of inflammation. In addition, she has no pancy-\ntopenia to suggest bone marroinfiltration or diffuse \nmarrosuppression, and no evidence of vitamin deficiency. \nShe has a disease (acute bacterial pneumonia) known to be \nassociated with acute anemla of Inflammation. Thus, t he \ndiagnosis is acute anemia of inflammation. Her pneumonia \nis treated with oral antibiotics, and her CBC returns back \nto her baseline when checked 6 weeks later. \n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. J is a 77-year-old African American man with a his-\ntory of an aortic valve replacement about 2 years ago. He \nbrought In results of tests done at another hospltal: Hb, \n9.0 g/dl; HCT, 27.4%; MCV, 90 mcm11; reticulocyte count, \n7%; The RPI Is 2.1. \n~ \nAt thle point. what 15 the leading hypothe51s, \n,~r what are the active alternatives, and le there a \nmust not mlu diagnosis? Given this differential \ndiagnosis, what tBete ehould be ord61'1Sd7 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe leading hypothesis is hemolysis, with the pivotal point being \nthe elevated reticulocyte count and RPI. The only potential active \nalternative would be active bleeding, which is also associated with \nan elevated RPI; however, that diagnosis should be clinically obvi-\nous. The pretest probability of hemolysis is high, and so all other \ncauses of anemia are alternative diagnoses to be considered only \nif the diagnosis of hemolysis is not supported by further testing. \nTable 6-4 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nMr. J has no history of hematemesls, melena, hematochezla, \nor abdominal pain. His abdominal exam is normal, and rectal \nexam shows brown. hemoccult-negative stool. \n~ \nIs the c::llnlc:al lnfomiatlon &Ufflc::fent to make a \n,~r diagnoeie7 If n~. what ~hsr information do \nyou nesd7 \nLeading Hypothesis: Hemolysis \nTatbook Presentation \nA classic presentation of hemolytic anemia is a previously healthy \npatient presenting with relatively acute onset of mild jaundice asso-\nciated with fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and dizziness, and a moder-\nate to severe degree of anemia. \nTable 6-4.

In macroangiopathic and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia \nand some complement-induced lysis, RBCs are destroyed in \nthe inttavascular space. \n1. Completely destroyed cells release free Hb into the plasma, \nwhich then binds to baptoglobin, reducing the plasma \nhaptoglobin levd. \n2. Some Hb is filtered by the glomerulus, causing \nhcmoglobinuria, which darkens the urine. \n3. Some filtered Hb is taken up by renal tubular cells, stored \nas hemosiderin; hemoslderinuria occurs about a week \nlater, when the tubular cells are sloughed into the urine. \n4. Damaged but incompletely hemolyzed cells are destroyed \nin the spleen. \nB. Deformed RBCs and those coated with complement are usually \ndestroyed in the ettravuc:ular space, in the liver or spleen. \n1. Most of the Hb is degraded into biliverdin, iron, and \ncarbon monoxide. \n2. Biliverdin is converted to unconjugated bilirubin and \nrdeased into the plasma, increasing the unconjugated \nbilirubin level. \n3. Some free Hb is rdeased, which then binds to haptoglobin, \nagain reducing the plasma haptoglobin level. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The reticulocyte count is usually at least 4-5%; in 1 study of \nautoimmune hemolytic anemia, the median was 9%. \nB. The serum haptoglobin should be< 25 mg/d.L. \n1. Sensitivity = 83%, specificity = 96% for hemolysis; \nLR+ = 21, LR- = 0.18 \n2. Haptoglobin is an acute phase reactant. \nC. The LD is often increased. \n1. Finding an increased ill and a decreased haptoglobin is \n90% specific for the diagnosis of hemolysis. \n2. Finding a normal LD and a normal serum haptoglobin \n(> 25 mgldL) is 92% sensitive for the absence ofhemolysis. \nD. The unconjugated bilirubin may be increased. \nE. Plasma and urine Hb should be elevated if the hemolysis is \nintravascular. \nTreatment \nTreatment depends on the underlying cause. In an autoimmune \ncondition, immunosuppressive therapy, especially prednisone, is \nused. Rituximab and splenectomy are options in refractory cases. \nIf hemolysis is associated with TTP and HUS, the treatment is \nplasmapheresis and immunosuppressive therapy. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr. J's serum haptoglobin is< 20 mg/dl, his serum bilirubin \nIs normal, and his LD Is elevated at 359 unlts/L. \nHaws you croeeed a dlagnoetlc thrsehold \nfor the leading hypothesis, hemolysls7 Have \nyou ruled out the active alternatives? Do \n~her tests need to be done to exclude the \nalternative diagnoeee7 \n\n116 I CHAPTER 6 \nThe combination of the high pretest probability and the large LR+ \nfur this level of haptoglobin confirms the diagnosis of hemolysis. \nActive bleeding has been ruled out by history and physical exam. \nAt this point, any further testing should be aimed at determining \nthe cause of the hemolysis. \nA. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), also known as the Coombs \ntest, should be done in all patients to distinguish immune-\nmediated from non-immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. \nI. Detects antibody or complement on the surface of the RBC \na. The DAT is positive fur IgG in patients with warm \nautoimmune hemolytic anemia. \nb. The DAT is positive for complement in patients with \ncold autoimmune hemolytic anemia. \nc. It is also positive in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, \ntransfusion-related hemolytic anemia, and some drug-\ninduced hemolytic anemias. \n2. The indirect Coombs test detects antibodies to RBC antigens \nin the patient's serwn and is sometimes positive in drug-\ninduced hemolytic anemias. \nB. The smear should be examined for schistocytes, seen in mac-\nroangiopathic and microangiopathic hemolytic anemias. \n1. Concomitant thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy are seen \nin DIC (See Chapter 8, Bleeding Disorders). \n2. Concomitant thrombocytopenia, chronic kidney disease, \nor neurologic symptoms are seen in TTP and HUS \n(See Chapter 8, Bleeding Disorders). \nC. Look fur other causes of hemolytic anemia through history \nand physical exam and test selectively. \n1. Does the patient have a mechanical valve? \n2. Has the patient uaveled to an area where malaria is endemic? \n3. Has the patient been exposed to a toxin? \n4. Does the: patient have: splenomegaly on exam or ultrasound? \n5. Is there an undiagnosed hereditary cause (especially G6PD \ndeficiency)? \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nHis WBC and platelet count as well as his kidney function \nare all normal; the Coombs test is negative. He does have \na feschlstocytes on his peripheral smear. Thi!: negative \nCoombs tests make autoimmune etlolO!:jles unlikely and \nthe schlstocytes suooest mlcroanglopathlc or macroan-\ngiopathic hemolysis. Given his history, the most likely \netiolO!:jy is hemolysis due to his mechanical valve. Since he is \nasymptomatic, it is not necessary to consider the removal \nof the valve. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nSickle Cell Anemia \nTextbook Presentation \nSickle cell anemia is often identified at birth through screening. \nAdult patients generally seek medical attention fur pain or some: of \nthe complications. Occasionally, patients have very mild disease, \nand sickle cell is diagnosed late in life when evidence of a specific \ncomplication, such as sickle cell retinopathy, is identified. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Epidemiology \n1. There: arc: 5 haplotypes, 4 African, and 1 Asian \n(Arab-Indian). \n2. Common genotypes include \na. Sickle cell anemia (homozygous HbS gene:) \nb. SC disease (HbS + HbC genes) \nc. HbS-beta-thalassc:mia {HbS + bc:ta0 or beta thalassemia \ngene) \nd. HbSO Arabia (HbS + HbO Arabia genes) \ne. HbSD Los Angeles [Punjab] (HbS + HbD genes) \n3. In African Americans, the gene frequency of HbS is 4%, \nofHbC is 1.5%, and ofbc:ta-thalassemia is 4%; the: \nincidence of sickle cell anemia is about I in 600, with the \nincidence of all sickle cell disease genotypes approaching \n1in300. \n4. In non-Hispanic white births, the: gene: frequency for sickle: \ncell or thalassemia is 0.17%. \nB. Pathophysiology (Figure 6-2) of sickle cell disease: \n1. Vaso-occlusion with ischemia-reperfusion injury \na. Vascular obstruction is caused by precapillary \nobstruction by sickled cells and inflammatory triggers. \nb. Episodic microvascular occlusion and ischemia is \nfollowed by restoration of blood flow, leading to further \ninjury during reperfusion as oxidases, cytokines, and \nother inflammatory mediators are activated. \n2. Hemolysis \na. Contributes to progressive vasculopathy \nb. Patients with high hemolytic rates are more anemic \nand have more cholelithiasis, leg ulcerations, priapism, \nand pulmonary hypertension than patients with lower \nhemolytic rates. \nc. Patients with lower hemolytic rates tend to have \nmore: episodes of acute: pain and possibly acute chest \nsyndrome:. \nC. Prognosis \n1. Median age at death is 42 for men and 48 fur women. \n2. Genetic factors can affect prognosis. \na. Higher levels of fetal hemoglobin are associated with \nincreased life expectancy, fewer acute pain episodes, and \nfewer leg ulcers; levels range from 1 % to 30%. \nb. Coexistent alpha-thalassemia (30% of patients of \nAfrican origin, 50% of patients of Arabian or Indian \norigin) leads to decreased rates of hemolysis and \nincreased hc:moglobin levels; pain frequency is not \nreduced, but the rates of stroke, gallstones, leg ulcers, \nand priapism are lower. \nD. Clinical manifestations of sickle: cell anc:mia \n1. Hematologic \na. HCT usually 20-30%, with rcticulocyte count of \n3-15%; patients with HbSC disease and HbS-beta+-\nthalassemia tend to be less anemic. \nb. Hb levels decrease slightly during acute pain episodes \nand episodes of acute chest syndrome; acute, marked \ndecreases can occur due to transient aplasia from \nparvovirus B 19 infections or sudden sequestration by \nthe liver or spleen. \nc. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LD, and \nlohaptoglobin are present. \n\nOxygenated erythrocyte containing HbS \nDeoxygenatsd erythrocyte wtth polymertzallon of HbS \n~ \nDehydrated slckled erythrocyte \nInfarction \nANEMIA I 117 \nAcute pain \nAcute chest syndrome \nCVA \nHypersplenlsm \nOsteonecro&is \nNephropathy \nlnftemmatlon \nIncreased expression of \n------------------- VCAM-1 and other \nHemolysls \n~ \n0 00 o \no \nFree plasma \nadhesion molecules \nHypercoagulabilily \n0 o 0 \no 0 hemoglobln, lnactlvadng \nf ~ ~ \nAM ~m \n.... : .. \nls-~c_~_~ISl_-_ng--o-\n_\n_: \n..... o \nN~o::=~:-\n\\ J \nJ \nFunctional NO deficiency \nPulmonary hypertension \nPrlaplsm \nLsg ulcers \nCerebrovascular disease \nVasculopathy and endothelial dysfunction \nCVA, carebrovasculer accident; HbS, sickle hemoglobin; NO, nitric oxide; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule. \nFigure 6-2. Pathophyslology of sickle cell disease. The roles of HbS polymertzatlon, hypervlscoslty, vaso-occluston, hemolysis, and \nendothelial dysfunction are shown. Deoxygenatlon causes HbS to polymerrze, leading to sickled erythrocytes. vaso-occluslon results from \nthe interaction of sickled erythrocytes with leukocytes and the vascular endothelium. Vaso-occluslon then leads to infarction, hemolysis, \nand Inflammation; Inflammation enhances the expression of adhesion molecules, further increasing tne tendency of sickled erythrocytes \nto adhere to the vascular endotnelium to worsen vaso-occluslon. Reperfusion of the lschemlc tissue generates free radicals and oxidative \ndamage. The damaged erythrocytes release free hemoglobin into the plasma, which strongly bind to nitric oxide, causing functional nitric \noxide deficiency and contributing to the development ofvasculopathy.

Sickle cell chronic lung disease \n(1) 35--60% of patients with sickle cell disease have \nreactive airways. \n(2) About 20% have restrictive lung disease, and \nanother 20% have mixed obstructive/restrictive \nabnormalities. \n(3) Up to 30% have pulmonary hypertension, with a \nvery high risk of death compared to patients without \npulmonary hypertension. Echocardiographic \nscreening of adults should be performed in patients \nwith symptoms or signs of pulmonary hypertension. \n3. Genitourinary \na. Renal \n(1) Inability to concentrate urine (hyposthenuria), with \nmaximum urinary osmolality of 400-450 mOsm/kg \n(2) Type 4 renal tubular acidosis \n(3) Hematuria is usually secondary to papillary necrosis, \nbut renal medullary carcinoma has been reported. \n(4) Microalbuminuria is common in childhood, with \nup to 20% of adults devdoping nephrotic range \nproteinuria, so all patients above age 10 should \nbe screened annually for proteinuria; angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used \nif proteinuria is found without other cause. \n(5) Chronic kidney disease devdops in 30% of adults. \nb. Priapism \n(1) 30-40% of adult males with sickle cell disease report \nat least 1 episode. \n(2) Bimodal peak incidences in ages 5-13 and 21-29. \n(3) 75% of episodes occur during sleep; the mean \nduration is 125 minutes. \n(4) Treatment approaches include hydration, analgesia, \ntransfusion, and injection of alpha-adrenergic drugs. \n4. Neurologic \na. Highest incidence of first infarction is between the ages of \n2 and 5, followed by another peak in incidence between \nthe ages of 35 and 45. \nb. Hemorrhagic stroke can also occur. \nc. Recurrent infarction occurs in 67% of patients. \nd. Silent infarction is common (seen in 18-23% of \npatients by age 14); cognitive deficits also common. \ne. Patients between the ages of 2 and 16 should undergo \nannual transcranial Doppler screening to assess \nstroke risk. \n(1) Patients with devated transcranial Doppler velocities \n(> 200 emfs) are at high risk. \n(2) Regular transfusions to keep the HbS level bdo30% \nreduces the risk of stroke in such patients by 90% \n(10% stroke rate in control group, 1 % in treannent \ngroup, number needed to treat (NNT) = 11). \n5. Musculoskdetal \na. Bones and joints often the sites of vase-occlusive \nepisodes. \nb. Avascular necrosis of hips, shoulders, ankles, and spine \ncan cause chronic pain. \n(1) Often best detected by MRI \n(2) May require joint replacement \n6. Other \na. Retinopathy \n(1) More common in patients with HbSC disease than \nwith sickle cdl (SS) disease \n(2) Treated with photocoagulation \n(3) Patients should be screened by an ophthalmologist \nfor retinopathy every 1-2 years. \nb. Leg ulcers \n(1) Present in about 20% of patients \n(2) Mose commonly over the medial or lateral malleoli \nc. Cholelithiasis: nearly universal due to chronic hemolysis \nd. Splenic sequestration and autosplenecromy: seen in \nchildren; leads to increased risk of infection with \nencapsulated organisms and the need for antibiotic \nprophylaxis \ne. Liver disease: multifactorial, due to causes such as iron \noverload or viral hepatitis \nE. Sickle cdl trait \n1. 8% of African Americans have sickle cell trait \n2. Patients with sickle cell trait are not anemic, do not have \npain crises, and do not have increased mortality rates. \n3. Most cannot concentrate urine normally due to \nimpairment of free water reabsorption, but this is clinically \nimportant only if hydration is inadequate. \n4. Benign, sdf-limited hematuria due to papillary necrosis \nis common; however, renal medullary cancer, stones, \nglomerulonephritis, and infection should be ruled out. \n5. There is no need to routindy screen for sickle cdl trait \nprior to surgery. \n6. Patients with sickle cdl trait have a 2-fold increased risk for \nvenous thromboembolism. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Newborn screening \n1. Universal screening identifies many more patients than \nscreening targeted at high-risk groups. \n2. Homozygotes have an FS pattern on electrophoresis, which \nis predominantly Hb F. with some Hb S, and no Hb A \n\n3. The FS pattern is not sped.fie fur sickle cell disease, and \nthe diagnosis should be confirmed through family studies, \nDNA-based testing, or repeat Hb electrophoresis at \n3-4 months of age. \nB. Testing in older children and adults \n1. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis separates Hb S from \nother variants; however, S, G, and D all have the same \ndectrophoretic mobility. \n2. Only Hb S will precipitate in a solubility test such as the \nSickledex. \nTreatment \nA. General principles \n1. All pediatric patients should receive prophylactic penicillin \nto prevent streptococcal sepsis. \n2. Indications for transfusion (preoperative transfusions \nand those for stroke prevention are evidence-based; \nother indications are based on expert opinion or clinical \npractice) \na. Acute transfusions: acute exacerbation of anemia, \nacure chest syndrome, acute stroke, multlorgan failure, \npreoperative management, acute splenic sequestration \nwith severe anemia, intrahepatic cholestasis, aplastic \ncrisis; do not transfuse for uncomplicated painful crisis, \nasymptomatic anemia, or priapism \nb. Chronic regular transfusions: previous clinically overt \nstroke \nc. Patients should be monitored for iron overload and \ntreated as needed. \n3. Patients of all ages should be vaccinated against \nSmptococcus pneumoniae, due to functional hyposplenism. \n4. Hydro:x:yurea \na. In patients with moderate to severe sickle cell disease, \nhydroxyurea therapy reduces the rate of pain crises and \ndevelopment of acute chest syndrome by about 50%. \nb. Hydroxyurea use is associated with a lower mortality \nrate. \n5. Stem cell transplant is an experimental therapy. \nB. Management of vaso-ocdusive crises \n1. The general approach should be similar to that used in \npatients with other causes of severe pain, such as cancer. \na. Rapidly initiate analgesics, while ruling out other causes \nof pain. \nb. If patients have mild to moderate pain and report relief \nwith NSAIDs, continue NSAIDs provided there is no \ncontraindication. \nc. If patients have severe pain, start IV opioid analgesics, \ncombined with NSAIDs, with frequent reassessments \nand dose adjustments as needed. \nd. In this setting, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or \nscheduled dosing is preferred to as-needed dosing. \ne. Remember that patients who use opioids long-term \nbecome tolerant and often require high doses for acute \npain. \nf. A multidisciplinary approach to pain management \ninvolving nurses and social workers may help optimize \npain management. \n2. Oral hydration is preferable to N hydration. \n3. Oxygen is indicated only if the patient is hypoxemic. \nBeta-Thalassemia \nTextbook Presentation \nANEMIA I 119 \nBeta-thalassemia major {homozygotes) presents in infancy with \nsevere, transfusion-dependent anemia. Some homozygotes have \nresidual beta chain synthesis resulting in an intermediate pheno-\ntype called thalassemia intermedia.

Beta-thalassemia minor: heterozygotes with 1 normal beta globin \nallele and 1 beta thalassemic allele. \n1. Anemia is generally mild (Hb 9-10 g/dL), and microcytosis \nis severe (MCV 65-75 mcm3). \n2. In pregnancy, anemia can be more severe than usual. \n3. Asymptomatic splenomegaly occurs in 15-20% of patients. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Iron studies should be normal; ROW usually normal; target \ncells abundant; RBCs may be normal or high. \nB.

Hodo I \ndetermine the cause? \nDiane Altkom, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. Y is a 30-year-old man with loback pain that has \nlasted for 6 days. \n~~ \nWhat fe the differential dlagnoeie of loback \n~JI\"' pain? Howould you frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMost loback pain is caused by conditions that are troublesome \nbut not progressive or life-threatening. The primary task when \nevaluating patients with loback pain is to identify those who \nhave a serious cause of back pain that requires specific, and some-\ntimes rapid, diagnosis and treatment. In practice, this means dis-\ntinguishing serious back pain (pain due to a systemic or visceral \ndisease or pain with significant neurologic symptoms or signs) \nfrom non.specific back pain related to the musculoskeletal strucrures \nof the back, called mechanical back pain. The framework for the \ndifferential diagnosis reflects this task \nA. Back pain due to disorders of the musculmkeletal structures \n1. Nonspeciflc (mechanical) back pain: no definite \nrelationship between anatomic abnormalities seen on \nimaging and symptoms \n2. Specific musculoskeletal back pain: clear relationship \nbetween anatomic abnormalities and symptoms \na. Lumbar radiculopathy due to herniated disk, \nosteophyte, facet hypertrophy, or neuroforaminal \nnarrowing \nb. Spinal stenosis \nc. Cauda equina syndrome \nB. Back pain due to syatcmic disease affecting the spine \n1. Serious and emergent (requires specific and often rapid \ntreatment) \na. Neoplasia \n(1) Plasma cell myeloma (formerly multiple mydoma), \nmetastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia \n(2) Spinal cord tumors, primary venebral tumors \nb. Infection \n(1) Osteomyelitis \n(2) Septic diskitis \n(3) Paraspinal abscess \n(4) Epidural abscess \n2. Serious but nonemergent {requires specific treatment \nbut not urgently) \na. Osteoporotic compression fracture \nb. Inflammatory arthritis \n(1) Axial spondyloarthritis \n(a) With sacroiliitis on x-ray \n(b) Without sacroiliitis on x-ray (with sacroiliitis on \nMRI or HLA-B27 positive plus clinical criteria) \n(2) Peripheral spondyloarthritis \n(a) With psoriasis \n(b) With inflammatory bowel disease \n(c) With preceding infection \n(d) Without associated condition \nC. Back pain due to visceral di.tease (serious, requires specific \nand rapid diagnosis and treatment) \n1. Retroperitoneal \na. Aortic aneurysm \nb. Retroperitoneal adenopathy or mass \n2. Pelvic \na. Prostatitis \nb. Endometriosis \nc. Pelvic inflammatory disease \n3. Renal \na. Nephrolithiasis \nb. Pyelonephritis \nc. Perinephric abscess \n4. Gastrointestinal (GI) \na. Pancreatitis \nb. Cholecystitis \nc. Penetrating ulcer \nFigure 7-1 reorganizes the differential diagnosis using pivotal \npoints and outlines the diagnostic approach to loback pain. In \nevery patient with back pain, it is essential to systematically ask \nabout and look for the clinical clues and pivotal points associ-\nated with serious causes of back pain (Table 7-1). In patients with \npositive findings, the initial patient-specific differential becomes \nlimited to serious systemic causes of back pain or specific mus-\nculoskdetal back pain. Likelihood ratios (LRs) for these find-\nings, when available, will be discussed later in the chapter. It is \nalso essential to understand the clinical neuroanatomy of the \nlower extremity to properly examine patients with loback pain \n(Figures 7-2 and 7-3). \n\n122 I CHAPTER 7 \nLoback pain \nConservative therapy \nfor presumed spinal \nstenosls (MRI If no \nresponse); perform \nABls to look for PAD \nConservative \ntherapy for \npresumed spinal \nstenosis (MRI If no \nresponse) \nSymptom-related testing \nas indicated (see \nChapters 3, 16, and 21) \nYes, spinal \nstenos is \nYes \nNo further \nevaluation \nnecessary \nNo \nMechanical back \npain; treat \nconservatively \nYes \nYes \nYes \nYes \nImmediate MRI to rule \nout cauda equlna \nsyndrome \nMRI to look for spinal \nepidural abscess or \nvertebral osteomyelltls \nSpine flm or MRI to look \nfor vertebral metastasis \nSpine film to look for \nosteoporotic compression \nfracture \nYes, sciatica \nor abnormal \nneuro exam \nTreat \nconservatively for \nherniated disk or \nosteophytic lumbar \nradiculopathy \nNo further \nevaluation \nnecessary \nConsider MRI; \nconsider \ninflammatory \narthritis \nMRI to confirm \ndiagnosis; \nconsider epidural \ninjection \nAAA, abdominal aortic aneurysm; ABls, ankle-brachia! index; GI, gastrointestinal; GU, genitourinary; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; \nPAD, peripheral arterial disease. \n1 Abnormal neurologic exam means abnormalities consistent with lumbar radiculopathy.

Signs and \nsymptoms of neurologic or systemic disease are pivotal points in \nthe assessment of back pain. It is necessary to further explore the \ndifferential by looking for findings listed in Tables 7-1 and 7-2. \nTable 7-2 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nThe clinical clues (sometimes called \"red flags\") \nlisted in Table 7-1 should be assessed in all \npatients with back pain. \nMr. Y ha5 no hl5tory of other lllne5se5. He ha5 had no \ntrauma, weight loss, fever, chms. or recent Infections. He \ntakes no medications and does not smoke, drink, or use \ninjection drugs. The 1:7ack pain does not radiate to his legs. \nOn physical exam, he has mild tendemess across his lower \n1:7ack; lower extremity strengt h. 5en5atlon. and reflexe5 are \nnormal.

If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nThe exploration does not undercover nefindings suggestive of \nspecific or serious causes of back pain, limiting the differential at \nthis point to nonspecific, mechanical loback pain. \nLeading Hypothesis: Mechanical LoBack Pain \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is nonradiating pain and stiffness in the \nlower back, sometimes precipitated by heavy lifting or another \nmuscular stress. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Can also have pain and stiffness in the buttocks and hips \nB. Often occurs hours to days after a neor unusual exertion \nand improves when the patient is supine, but one-third of \npatients do not identify a specific precipitant \nC. Can rardy make a specific anatomic diagnosis \nD. Neneurologic abnormalities on history or physical exam \nshould prompt investigation of another diagnosis. \nE. Lifetime prevalence of mechanical loback pain is 84%. \nF. Prognosis \n1. 75-90% of patients improve within 1 month; of the subset \nwith pain at 3 months, only 40% recover by 12 months. \n2. 25-50% of patients have additional episodes over the next year \n3. Risk factors for persistent loback pain, which occurs in \n10-15% of patients, include \na. Maladaptive pain coping behaviors \nb. High level of baseline functional impairment \nc. Logeneral health status \ncl. Presence of psychiatric comorbidities \ne. Presence of \"nonorganic signs\" (signs suggesting a \nstrong psychological component to pain, such as \nsuperficial or nonanatomic tenderness, overreaction, \n\n124 I CHAPTER 7 \nPosterior \ncutaneous \nnerve of thigh \nArea supplied \nby the lateral cutaneous \nnerve of the thigh \nArea supplied by \nthe femoral nerve \nSaphenous branch \nof the femoral nerve \nL3 \nL4 \nCutaneous \nbranch of \nperoneal \nL5 \nCutaneous branch \nof the peroneal \n1 ioo~+---L4 \nnerve \nA \nArea supplied by \nthe cutaneous \nbranches of the \ntibial nerve \nB \nS1 \nL5 \n8 cia~~ \nNote: L5 supplies the \ndorsum and sole of \nthe foot \nFigure 7-2.

The absence of all red flags is 99% predictive of a nonserious \netiology of loback pain. \nB. Many asymptomatic patients will have anatomic abnormalities \non imaging studies. \n1. 20% of patients aged 14-25 have degenerative disks on \nplain radiographs. \n2. 20-75% of patients younger than 50 years have herniated \ndisks on MRI. \n3. 40-80% of patients have bulging disks on MRI. \n4. Over 90% of patients older than age 50 have degenerative \ndisks on MRI. \n5. 20-30% of patients over age 50 have spinal stenosis. \nC. Even in symptomatic patients, anatomic abnormalities are not \nnecessarily causative, and identifying them does not influence \ninitial treatment decisions. \nD. A speciflc pathoanatomic diagnosis cannot be made in 85% of \npatients with isolated loback pain. \nE. Imaging does not improve clinical outcomes, such as pain or \nfunctional status, especially in patients with acute(< 4 weeks) \nor subacute (4-12 weeks) pain. \nTreatment \nPatients who have none of the clinical clues \nshould not have any diagnostic imaging per-\nformed. If done, diagnostic imaging will often \nflnd clinically unimportant abnormalities. \nMultiple specialty societies recommend not \nimaging (spinal radiographs or MRI) in the \nabsence of clinical clues. \nA. Acute loback pain \n1. The American College of Physicians has recently published \nevidence-based guidelines fur the treatment of loback \npain. \n2. Most people with acute loback pain improve over time, \nregardless of treatment. \n3. There is moderate quality evidence that nonsteroidal antl-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or skeletal muscle rdaxants \nare effective for acute loback pain; acetaminophen is not \neffective in clinical trials. \n4. Heat and spinal manipulation have been shown to reduce \nacute loback pain; acupuncture and massage may also \nhelp. \nS. The best approach is NSAIDs and heat during the acute \nphase with activity as tolerated until the pain resolves, \nfollowed by specific daily back exercises. \n\nHipflexion \nlliopsoas (L2,3) \nDirect nerve supply and femoral twigs \nHip extension \nGlutei (L4,5) \nGluteal nerves \n* \nPlantar ftexlon \nDorslflexlon \nL4, LS \nPeroneal nerve \n(Tibialis anterior) \n(Long extensors) \n(Peroneus tertius) \n(Extensor digitorum \nbrevis) \n81, S2 \nTibial nerve \n(Gastrocnemii) \n(Tibialis posterior) \nKnaa extension \nQuadriceps (L2,3,4) femoral nerve \nKnaa flaxlon \nHamstrings (LS, S1) \nTibial nerve, peroneal nerve \nLateral head of biceps temoris only \nInversion of the foot \nEveralon of the foot \nSt \nPeroneal nerve \n(Peronei longus and \nbrevis) \n(long extensors assist) \n(Extensor digitorum \nbrevis) \nBACK PAIN I 125 \nJ \nHip abduction \nGlutei and tensor fascia lata (L4,5) \nHip adduction \nAdductor group (L2,3,4) \nObturator nerve \nTibial and peroneal nerves \n(Note: tibialis anterior, an anterior \ncompartment muscle, and tibialis posterior, \na posterior compartment muscle, work \ntogether) \nFigure 7-3.

There is moderate quality evidence that exercise, yoga, \nmultidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, and \nmindfulness-based stress reduction are effective for \nchronic loback pain. \n2. There is low-quality evidence that cognitive-behavioral \ntherapy, spinal manipulation, tai chi, progressive relaxation, \nand electromyography biofeedback, are effective for chronic \nloback pain. \n3. NSAIDs are first-line pharmacologic therapy; tramadol or \nduloxetine are second line. \n4. Opioids are an option for patients who have not responded \nto all other therapies after a discussion of risks and benefits. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nConsidering Mr. Y's history and physical exam, there is no need to con-\nsider other diagnoses at this point. Should he not respond to conserva-\ntive therapy; the alternative diagnoses would need to be reconsidered. \n\nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nYou reassure Mr. Y that his pain will resolve within another \n2-3 weeks. You recommend that he use ibuprofen as \nneeded and be as active as posslble within the llmlts of the \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. H, a 47-year-old woman, was well untll 2 days ago, \nwhen she started having loback pain after working Jn \nher garden and pulling weeds for several hours. The pain is \na constant, dull ache that radiates to her right buttock \nand hip. Yesterday, after sitting In a movie, the pain began \nradiating to the back of the right knee. She has taken \nsome acetaminophen and Ibuprofen without much rellef \nHer past medical history Is unremarkable, and she takes \nno medicines. She has no constitutional, bowel, or bladder \nsymptoms. \n~ \nAt this point. what is the leading hypothesis, \n1~Jll\"' what are the active altemativee, and ie \nthere a muet not miee dlagnoele1 Given thle \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests should .be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nSimilar to the patient discussed in the first case, Mrs. H's loback \npain developed after an unusual exertion, and she has no systemic \nsymptoms. However, her pain is worsened by sitting and radiates \ndown the back of her leg (a pain distribution that suggests radicular \npain in the L5-S 1 distribution, often called sciatica}. Both of these \npivotal features increase the probability that she has a herniated \ndisk. She has no findings that suggest a systemic cause of her back \npain, so the initial differential is limited. Table 7-3 lists the differ-\nential diagnosis. \nOn physical exam, Mrs.His clearly uncomfortable. She has \nno back tendemess and has full range of motion of both \nhips. When her right leg Is raised to about 60 degrees, pain \nshoots down the leg. When her left leg is raised, she has pain \nin her lower back. Her strength and sensation are normal, \nbut the right ankle reflex Is absent. \n~ \nle the clinical Information &ufficient to make a \n1~Jll\"' diagnosis? If not, what other information do \nyou need? \nBACK PAIN I 127 \npain. Rather than weight ll~in g, you suggest swimming or \nwalking for exercise untll his pain resolves. You also provide \na handout on proper llftlng technlr.iues and back exercises, \nto be started after t he pain resolves. He cancels a follow-up \nappointment 1 month later, leaving a message that his pa in \nis gone and he has resumed all of his usual activities. \nTable 7-3.

This type of pain is \ncalled sciatica, and it is classically precipitated by a sudden increase \nin pressure on the disk, such as after coughing or lifting. \nDisea5e Highlights \nA. Disk disease is frequently asymptomatic; pain occurs \nwhen direct contact of the disk with a nerve root provokes \ninflammation. \nB. 95% of clinically important disk herniations occur at L4-L5 \nand 15--S 1, so pain and paresthesias are most often seen in the \ndistributions of these nerves (Figures 7-2 and 7-3). \n1. Rad.icular pain is often described as sharp, shooting or \nburning but can also be described as throbbing, tingling, \nor dull. \n2. Neurologic abnormalities such as paresthesias/sensory loss \nand motor weakness are found variably and can occur in the \nabsence of pain. Table 7-4 describes the typical findings. \nC. Myofascial pain syndromes and hip and knee pathology can be \ndifficult ro distinguish from radiculopathy; many patients have \nboth radiculopathy and other musculoskeletal conditions. \n\n128 I CHAPTER 7 \nTable 7-4.

Coughing, sneezing, or prolonged sitting can aggravate \nradicular pain from a herniated disk. \nE. 36% of patients recover in 2 weeks, 70% in 6 weeks, and \n87% in 3 months; 25% will have recurrent symptoms within \n1 year. \nF. Occasionally, there are nonspinal causes of sciatica. \n1. Traumatic injury of the nerve in pelvic fracmre or \nhamstring injury \n2. Gynecologic and peripartum causes such as compression \nfrom ovarian cysts or the fetal head \n3. Compression of the nerve by the overlying piriformis \nmuscle (piriformis syndrome), characterized by focal \nmid-buttock pain, tenderness over the sciatic notch, \nincreased pain with sitting, and increased pain with \nexternal hip rotation. \nG. There are no bowel or bladder symptoms with unilateral \ndisk herniations. \nH. Large midline herniations can cause the c:auda. cquina \nsyndrome. \n1. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare condition caused by \ntumor or massive midline disk herniations. \n2. It is characterized by the following: \n~ \na. Urinary retention (sensitivity 90%, specificity 95%; \nLR+ = 18, LR- = 0.1) \nb. Urinary incontinence \nc. Decreased anal sphincter tone (80% of patients) \nd. Sensory loss in a saddle distribution (75% of patients) \ne. Bilateral sciatica \nf. Leg weakness \ng. The combination of measured urinary retention \n> 500 mL, and at least 2 of 3 typical symptoms \n(bilateral sciatica, subjective urinary retention, and \nrectal incontinence) is highly predictive of cauda \nequina syndrome on MRI. \nSuspected cauda equina syndrome is a medical \nemergency that requires immediate imaging \nand decompression. \nTable 7-5.

History and physical exam (Table 7-5) \n 1. Sciatica has an LR+ of7.9 for the diagnosis ofL4-5 or \nL5-S 1 herniated disk. \n2. Straight leg test is performed by holding the heel in 1 hand \nand slowly raising the leg, keeping the knee extended. \nL A positive test reproduces the patient's sciatica when the \nleg is elevated between 30 and 60 degrees. \nb. The patient should describe the pain induced by the \nmaneuver as shooting down the leg not just a pulling \nsensation in the hamstring muscle. \nc. Increased pain on dorsiflexion of the foot or large toe \nincreases sensitivity. \n3. Crossed straight leg test is performed by lifting the contralateral \nleg; a positive test reproduces the sciatica in the affected leg. \n~ \nA ~tr~ght le~ raise test that elicits just back \ny \npam is negative. \n4. Combinations of abnormal findings are presumably more \nspecific than isolated findings. \nB. Imaging \n1. Plain radiographs do not image the disks and are useless fur \ndiagnosing herniations. \n2. Noninfused CT and MRI scans have similar test \ncharacteristics fur diagnosing herniated disks. \nL CT: sensitivity, 62-90%; specificity, 70--87%; best \nLR+, 6.9; LR-, 0.11 \nb. MRI: sensitivity, 60-100%; specificity, 43--97%; best \nLR+, 33, LR-, O \nC. Electromyography (EMG) \n1. Primarily used to confirm lumbosacral radiculopathy and \nexclude other peripheral nerve abnormalities, particularly \nwhen physical exam abnormalities do not correlate with \nimaging abnormalities \n\n2. Also used to determine the severity and chronicity of \na radiculopathy, and the functional significance of an \nimaging abnormality \n3. Most useful for subacute abnormalities (3 weeks to \n3 months after the onset of symptoms} \n4. Sensitivity for detecting radiculopathy ranges from \n46% to 77%, with specificity of71-88%. \nTreatment \nA. In the absence of cauda equina syndrome or progressive \nneurologic dysfunction, conservative therapy should be cried \nfor 6 weeks. There is little evidence to guide clinicians. \n1. NSAIDs are the first choice. \n2. Gabapentin is often used but has not been well studied; \npregabalin was ineffective in a recent study. \n3. Tramadol and other opioids should be used only in patients \nwith severe pain and for short periods of time. \n4. Short courses of oral corticosteroids modestly improve \nacute pain; epidural corticosteroid injections may provide \ntemporary pain relief. \n5. Supervised exercise modestly reduces pain, and bed rest \nshould be avoided. \n6. Chiropractic manipulation has been shown to reduce pain \nin the short term. \nB. Surgery \n1. Indications include \na. Impairment ofbowel and bladder function \n(cauda equina syndrome) \nb. Gross motor weakness \nc. Progressive neurologic symptoms or signs \nd. No response after 6 weeks of conservative therapy. \n2. Surgery should not be done for painless herniations \nor when the herniation is at a different level than the \nsymptoms. \n3. In the absence of progressive neurologic symptoms, surgery \nis elective; patients with disk herniations and radicular pain \ngenerally recover with or without surgery. \na. Randomized trials of surgery versus conservative therapy \nfor symptomatic L4-5or15--Sl herniated disks found \nshort-term benefits for surgery. \n(1) Patients who received surgery had better pain and \nfunction scores at 12 weeks, but both groups had \nidentical scores at 52 weeks. \n(2) The median time to recovery was 4 weeks for the \nsurgery group and 12 weeks for the conservative \ntherapy group. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs.Pisa 75-year-old woman who was well until 2 days \nago when pain developed in the center of her lower back. \nThe pain is constant and becoming more severe. There \nIs no position or movement that changes the pain, \nand It Is not relieved with acetaminophen or Ibuprofen. \nBACK PAIN I 129 \nb. Patient preference should drive decision making with \nregard to surgery. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMrs. H has sciat ica, a pos~lve straight leg raise test, and \nan absent ankle reflex, a combination that st rongly sug-\ngests nerve root impingement at L5-S1. One option at \nthis point would be to order an MRI or CT scan to confirm a \nherniated disk. However. there are 2 questions to consider \nbefore ordering a scan: \n1. Will the ecan be dlagnostic1 Ram ember that \na elgnlflcant percentage of aeymptomatic: \npeople have hemlated disks on CT or MRI. \n2.

Mrs. H calls the next day, reporting that she \nwas una171eto sleep 1:1ecause of the pain. You then prescribe \ngabapentin, which provides good pain relief. Two weeks later, \nshe Is rarely using the gabapentln and Is only using Ibupro-\nfen 1 to 2 times a day. Two months later, she Is pain-free \nand back to her usual activities, although her ankle reflex \nis still absent-a common and not significant finding. She \nis fine until about a year later, when identical pain develops \nafter a bad bronchit is. Her pain resolves with a fedays of \nIbuprofen and gabapent ln. \nIt sometimes radiates In a belt like fashion across her \nlower back, extending around to t he abdomen. She has no \nfever or weight loss. Her past medical history is notable \nfor a radial fract ure after falling off her bicycle 15 years \nago, and breast cancer 2 years ago, t reated wit h lump-\nectomy and radiation t herapY. She current ly takes only \n1 medicat ion, letrozole. Her last mammogram was normal \n6 months ago. \n(continued) \n\n130 I CHAPTER 7 \nAt this point, what ie the leading hypotheeie, \nwhat are the active altemativee, and le \nthere a must not mle& diagnoeie1 Given this \ndifferential diagnoeie, what teete ehould be \nordensd1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMrs. P has several pivotal clinical findings that suggest her back \npain could be due to a more serious, systemic disease rather than \nbeing nonspecific, mechanical back pain. First, she is older and \nhas a history of cancer; both findings are associated with malig-\nnancy as a cause of back pain. Second, her age and history of a \nprevious fracture are established risk factors for osteoporosis. In \naddition, aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole increase bone loss \nand are associated with an increased risk of fractures (OR= 1.47). \nMetastatic breast cancer is more emergent than venebral compres-\nsion fracture and is therefore both the leading and must not miss \nhypothesis. Table 7-6 lists the differential diagnosis. \nOn physical exam, she Is in obvious pain. She is 5 ~ 2 in and \nweighs 115 lbs. There Is diffuse tenderness across her \nlower back, with no point tenderness of the vertebrae. There \nIs no rash as would be seen In herpes zoster, and abdominal \nexam is normal. Her reflexes, strength, and sensation are all \nnormal, and stra!eht leg raise is negative. \n~ \nle the clinical Information sufficient to make a \n1~Jll\"\"' diagnoeie1 If not, what other information do \nyou need1 \nLeading Hypothesis: Back Pain Due \nto Metastatic Cancer \nTextbook Presentatlon \nThe classic presentation is the development of constant, dull back \npain that is not rdieved by rest and is worse at night in a patient \nwith a known malignancy. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Bone metastases can be limited to the vertebral body or extend \ninto the epidural space, causing cord compression. \nB.

Malignancy causes < 1 % of back pain in general but is the \ncause in most patients with active cancer who have back pain. \nD. Most common sources are breast, lung. or prostate cancer. \nI. Renal and thyroid cancers also commonly metastasize \nto bone. \n2. Mydoma and lymphoma frequently involve the spine. \nE. Metastases are in the thoracic venebrae in 60% of cases, in the \nlumbar spine in 25%, and in the cervical spine in 15%. Up to \none-third of patients have multiple spine metastases. \nTable 7-6.

However, because of the \nsuboptimal LR- af about 0 .4, It will be necessary to perform \nadditional imaging if the plain radlographs are normal. \nThe lumbar spine films shoa vertebral compression \nfracture at L 1, which is newhen compared with films done \nseveral months ago. \nBACK PAIN I 131 \nHave you c::ro9&ed a diagn09tic thre9hold for \nthe leading h)'pothHie, metaBtatic:: c::anc::er7 \nHave you ruled out the active alternatlve57 \nDo other teet9 nl!IBd to be done to exclude \nthe alternative diagnoses? \nAlternative Diagnosis: Osteoporotic \nCompression Fracture \nTatbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is acute, severe pain that develops in an \nolder woman and radiates around the flank to the abdomen, occur-\nring either spontaneously or brought on by trivial activity such as \nminor lifting, bending, or jarring. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Fractures are usually in the mid to lower thoracic or lumbar \nregion. \nB. Fractures at T 4 or higher are more often due to malignancy \nthan osteoporosis. \nC. Pain is often increased by slight movements, such as turning \nover in bed. \nD. Can also be asymptomatic \nE. Pain usually improves within 1 week and resolves by \n4--6 weeks, but some patients have more chronic pain. \nF. Osteoporosis is usually related to menopause and aging. \nG. Can occur as a complication of a variety of diseases and \nmedications. \n1. Most common diseases include hyperthyroidism, primary \nhyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, hypogonadism, \nand malahsorption. \n2. Medications that can lead to osteoporosis include \ncorticosteroids (most common), anticonvulsants, \naromatase inhibitors, and long-term heparin therapy. \nH. Risk factors for osteoporosis include \n1. Age \na. Strongest risk factor \nb. Relative risk of almost 10 for women aged 70-74 \n(compared with women under 65), increasing to a \nrdative risk of22.5 for women over 80 \n2. Personal history of rib, spine, wrist, or hip fracture \n3. Current smoking or use of~ 3 units of alcohol daily \n4. White, Hispanic, or Asian ethnicity \n5. Weight < 132 lbs \n6. Parental history of hip fracture \nI. Bone density testing: The T score is defined as the number \nof standard deviations different the current bone density is \ncompared to a young adult reference population: a T score \n?; -1.0 is normal, < -1.0 and> -2.5 is osteopenia, and \ns -2.5 is osteoporosis. \n1. Over 1 S years, the absolute risk of vertebral fracture is \nabout 10% for women with T scores of 0 to -1.0 and \nabout 30% for women with T scores of-2.5 or worse. \n2. Women with a prevalent venehral fracture and a T score \n> -1. 0 have the same absolute risk of subsequent fracture \n(~25%) as women without prevalent fractures and T scores \ns -2.5. \n\n132 I CHAPTER 7 \n3. The FRAX score, used to estimate the 10-year probability \nof a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture, is \navailable at http://www.shef.ac. uk/FRAX/ \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA History and physical exam \n1. Not well studied \n2. Age> 70 has LR+ of5.5 \n~3. History of corticosteroid use has LR+ of 12.0 for diagnosis \nof osteoporotic compression fracture as a cause of back. pain. \n4. Patients with at least 3 typical risk factors (female sex, age \nover 70, trauma, and use of corticosteroids) have a very \nhigh likelihood of having an osteoporotic compression \nfracture. \nB. Imaging \n1. MRI is probably more sensitive and specific than \nradiographs, but data are not available; most compression \nfractures are diagnosed with radiographs, unless there is a \nconcern fur malignancy. \n2. MRI can distinguish between benign and malignant \nosteoporotic compression fractures, with sensitivity of \n88.5-100% and specificity of 89.5-93% (LR+ = 8-14, \nLR- = 0-0.12). \n3. Bone scan can be useful for determining acuity. \nTreatment \nMRI scan is the best way to distinguish \nmalignant from benign osteoporotic \ncompression fractures. \nA Osteoporosis \n1. Total calcium intake (dietary plus supplementation, if \nnecessary) should be 1200 mg daily for women over \n50 years of age; total vitamin D intake should be 600 \ninternational units daily for women up to age 70 and 800 \ninternational units daily for women over age 70. Excessive \nsupplementation may be harmful. \n2. Bisphosphonates both increase bone density and reduce \nfracture risk. \na. Alendronate and risedronate (oral, once per week) \nreduce vertebral, nonvenebral, and hip fractures. \nb. lbandronate (oral, once per month) reduces vertebral \nfractures. \nc. Zoledronic acid (intravenous, once per year) reduces \nvertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. F is a 65-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, hyper-\ntension. anc:i osteoarthritis who come5 Into your office \ncomplaining of several months of loback pain. Sometimes \nthe pain Is llmlted to his back, but It sometimes radiates to \nhis buttocks, hips. thi{:jhs. and calves when he walks. \n3. Raloxifene reduces risk of spine fractures but not hip fractures. \na. It reduces the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast \ncancer (relative risk= 0.56). \nb. It increases the risk of venous thromboembolism \n(relative risk about 3). \n4. Parathyroid hormone (teriparatide; subcutaneous, \ndaily) increases bone density and reduces vertebral and \nnonvenebral fractures. \n5. Denosurnab, a monoclonal antibody RANKL inhibitor that \nblocks osteoclast function, (subcutaneous, every 6 months) \nreduces vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures. \n6. Estrogen prevents fractures but is no longer recommended \nfur long-term therapy due to such adverse events as the \nfollowing: \na. Venous thromboembolism \nb. Breast cancer \nc. Myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents \n7. Calcitonin does not significantly increase bone density or \nprevent fractures. \nB. Compression fractures \n1. Calcitonin sometimes reduces the pain from an acute \nvertebral compression fracture. \n2. Vertebroplasty (percutaneous injection of bone cement \nunder fluoroscopic guidance into a collapsed vertebra) and \nkyphoplasty, (introduction of bone cement and inflatable \nbone tamps into the fractured vertebral body) have not been \nshown to reduce pain in well-done randomi7.ed controlled \ntrials using sham procedures in the control groups. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nBecause of her history of breast cancer, Mrs. P unc:iergoes \nan MRI scan; the scan confirms the diagnosis of osteopo-\nrotic compression fracture. She is treated with opioids, and \nher pain resolve5 over 3-4 weeks. Her bone c:ienslty results \nshoa spl ne T score of -2.1, anc:i a hip T score of -2.6. Her \nosteoporosis Is due to a combination of postmenopausal \nosteoporosis and exposure to an aromatase inhibitor. \nTreatment with alendronate is started. \nRegardless of Mrs. P's bone density results, the presence of a ver-\ntebral compression fracture mandates treatment fur osteoporosis. \nReviewing her history, she had several risk factors for osteoporosis, \nincluding her age, weight, and history of a wrist fracture. \nAlthough generally achy in character. he sometimes feels \nnumbness In both t hi{:j hs.

He does \nnot have pivotal systemic symptoms suggesting that infection \nshould be included in the initial differential diagnosis. Exploring \nhis history, there are 2 historical findings suongly suggesting spinal \nstenosis: the sensation of numbness with exertion (neurogenic or \n\"pseudoclaudication,,). and the improvement in the pain when he \nbends forward to push a grocery cart. Although the absence of noc-\nturnal pain reduces the probability of metastatic cancer, that is still \na possibility because of his age. Another pivotal clue is that he has \nrisk factors for vascular disease, and so peripheral arterial disease \n(PAD) must be considered as an explanation for the achy, exer-\ntional leg pain. Mechanical loback pain, although common, is \nvery unlikely given the pivotal clue of neurologic symptoms (thigh \nnumbness). Disk herniation is a final possibility, although it would \nhave to be a central herniation to explain the bilateral symptoms. \nTable 7-8 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nMr. F's past medical history is notable for hypertension, \ntype 2 diabetes, and osteoarthritis of his knees. He quit \nsmoking 10 years ago, having smoked 1 pack per day for \n30 years. His medications Include llsinopril, gllplzlde, ator-\nvastatin, aspirin, and acetaminophen or Ibuprofen. He has \nno history of cancer, and his prostate-specific antigen \n(PSA) was 0.9 ng/ml 1 month ago. He has no back or hip \nTable 7-8.

The clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis consists of \ncharacteristic symptoms and radiographic abnormalities such \nas spondylolisthesis, disk-space narrowing, facet-joint hyper-\ntrophy, neural foramina osteophytes; the estimated prevalence \nis 12-21 % of older adults. \n1. Neurogenic claudication, a variable pain or discomfort \nwith walking or prolonged standing that radiates into \nthe buttocks, thighs, or lower legs, is the most common \nsymptom. \n2. Radicular or polyradicular pain can occur and is not as \nrelated to position as neurogenic claudication. \n3. Descriptions of pain from spinal stenosis differ qualitatively \nfrom textbook descriptions of vascular claudication \n(Table 7-9). \nB. Neurologic symptoms and signs are variable. \nC. Stenosis is seen most often in the lumbar spine, sometimes in \nthe cervical spine, and rarely in the thoracic spine. \nD. Spinal stenosis is due to hypertrophic degenerative processes \nand degenerative spondylolisthesis compressing the spinal \ncord, cauda equina, individual nerve roots, and the arterioles \nand capillaries supplying the cauda equina and nerve roots. \nE. Pain is worsened by extension and relieved by flex.ion. \nF. Patients with central stenosis generally have bilateral, non-\ndermatomal pain involving the buttocks and posterior thighs. \nTable 7-9.

Patients with lateral stenosis generally have pain in a \ndermatomal distribution. \nH. Repeating the physical exam after rapid walking might \ndemonstrate subtle abnormalities. \nI. About 50% of patients have stable symptoms; when \nworsening occurs, it is gradual. \n1. Lumbar spinal stenosis does not progress to paralysis and \nshould be managed based on severity of symptoms. \n2. Progression of cervical and thoracic stenoses can cause \nmyclopathy and paralysis and requires surgery more often \nthan lumbar spinal stenosis. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam \n~ \n1. Wide-based gait has an LR+ of 13 for the diagnosis of \nspinal stenosis. \n2. Table 7-10 outlines the historical and physical exam \nfindings associated with the diagnosis of spinal stenosis. \nB. Imaging \n1. Plain radiographs are not necessary: they do not change \nmanagement, or provide the degree of anatomic detail \nnecessary to guide intcrventional treatment {such as \nepidural injection or surgery}. \n2. Noninfused CT and noninfused MRI have similar test \ncharacteristics. \na. CT scan: sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 80-96%; LR+, \n4.5-22; LR-, 0.10-0.12 \nb. MRI: sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 72-99%; LR+, \n3.2-90; LR-, 0.10-0.14 \nc. Up to 21 % of asymptomatic patients over age 65 have \nspinal stenosis on MRI. \nTable 7-10.

Patients with typical symptoms who respond to \nconservative therapy can be managed without imaging. \nTreatment \nCT and MRI scans can rule out spinal stenosis \nbut cannot necessarily determine whether \nvisualized stenosis is causing the patient's \nsymptoms. \nA. Evidence to guide treatment decisions is minimal. \nB. Nonoperative treatment is variably successful. 15-70% of \npatients stabilize or improve. \n1. Medications used for pain relief include NSAIDs, tricyclic \nantidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, tramadol, and \nsometimes opioids. \n2. Physical therapy improves stamina and muscle strength \nin the legs and trunk; exercises performed with lumbar \nflexion, such as cycling, may be better tolerated than \nwalking. \n3. A randomized trial of epidural injection of corticosteroids \nand lidocaine, vs. lidocaine alone, found that adding \ncorticosteroids did not reduce pain at 6 weeks. \nC. Surgery \n1. Primary indication is increasing pain that is not responsive \nto conservative measures. \n2. Observational data shothe following: \na. More effective in reducing leg pain than back pain. \nb. Reported improvement rates range between 64% and \n91%. \nc. Reoperation rates range from 6% to 23%. \nd. Predictors of a positive response to surgery include male \nsex, younger age, better walking ability, better self-rated \nhealth, less comorbidity, and more pronounced canal \nstenosis. \n3. A recent trial with both a randomized and observation \ncohort showed the following: \na. In the intention to treat analysis of the randomized \ncohort, patients randornired to surgery reported better \nscores on 1 measure ofbodily pain at 2 years than did \nthose randomized to conservative therapy. \nb. In the analysis of the observational cohort, patients who \nchose surgery reported better pain and function scores \nthan those who chose conservative therapy. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. F's history remains SUflgestlve of spinal stenosls; his \nphysical exam neither rules in nor rules out the diagnosis. \nYou prescribe acetaminophen and gabapentln, refer him to \nphysical therapY. and plan to order an MRl If he does not \nrespond to conservative treatment. \nHaws you Cl'OfJ!ifJd a dlagno!itlc thre!ihold for \nthe ludlng hypothesis, spinal stenos!s1 Have \nyou ruled out the actlve alternative, PAD1 Do \nother tests nl!Ji to !:re dons to fJXClude the \nalternative diagnosss1 \n\nAlternative Diagnosis: Peripheral \nArterial Disease (PAD) \nTenbook Presentation \nClassic claudication is defined as reproducible, exercise-induced calf \npain that requires stopping and is relieved with < 10 minutes of rest. \nCritical limb ischemia classically presents with pain in the feet at \nrest that may be relieved by placing the feet in a dependent position. \nDisease Highlights \nA. In a study of outpatients over the age of70, or aged 50-69 \nwith a history of smoking or diabetes, the prevalence of PAD \nwas29%. \n1. Only 11 % of the patients with PAD had classic \nclaudication. \n2. 47% of patients had atypical symptoms (exertional leg pain \nthat was not in the calf or was not relieved by rest), and \n42% had no leg pain. \nB. Critical limb ischemia is the presenting manifestation in \n1-2% of patients. \nC. Risk factors include \n1. Smoking and diabetes are the strongest risk factors \n(relative risk of PAD increases by 1.4 for every 10 cigarettes \nsmoked/day and by 2.6 in patients with diabetes). \n2. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also risk factors. \n3. Patients with other vascular disease have a high prevalence \nof PAD (19% in patients with ischemic heart disease and \n26% in patients with stroke). \n4. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients with risk factors \nranges from 7% to 15%. \nD. Patients with PAD have a high prevalence of coronary artery \ndisease and cerebrovascular disease with an annual rate of \ncardiovascular events of 5-7%. \nE. PAD is associated with a progressive decline in walking \nendurance and an increased rate of depression. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \n1. The presence of classic claudication has an LR+ = 3.30. \n2. The absence of classic claudication has an LR- = 0.89. \nB. Physical exam \n1. Skin changes \na. In symptomatic patients, skin being cooler to the touch \nand the presence of a foot ulcer in the affected leg both \nhave an LR+ = 5.9 and an LR- of about 0.92. \nb. Skin changes (atrophic or cool skin, blue/purple skin, \nabsence oflower limb hair) are not useful in assessing \nfor PAD in asymptomatic patients. \n2. Bruits \na. In symptomatic patients the presence of an iliac, \nfemoral, or popliteal bruit has an LR+ = 5.6; the absence \nof a bruit in all 3 locations has an LR- = 0.39. \nb. In asymptomatic patients, the finding of a femoral bruit \nhas an LR+ = 4.8; the absence of a femoral bruit does \nnot change the probability of PAD. \n3. Pulses \n.. a. An abnormal femoral pulse has an LR+ = 7.2; an \nabnormal posterior tibia! pulse has an LR+ = 8.10. \nBACK PAIN I 135 \nb. An abnormal dorsalis pedis pulse does not substantially \nincrease the probability of PAD (LR+ = 1.9); the \ndorsalis pedis pulse is not palpable in 8 .1 % of normal \nindividuals. \nc. The absence of an abnormality in any pulse has a wide \nrange of negative LRs (0.38-0.87). \n4. Capillary refill time \na. Apply firm pressure to the plantar aspect of the great \ntoe for 5 seconds; after releasing the toe, normal color \nshould return in S 5 seconds. \nb. Neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosing PAD \n~ \nLack of typical symptoms and physical findings \ny \ndoes not lower the likdihood of PAD. \nC. Ankle-brachia! index (ABI) \n1. Systolic pressures are measured in the arms and at the \nankles. The formula for the ABI is: Highest ankle pressure \n(mm Hg)/Highest arm pressure (mm Hg) \n2. Using a cutoff of 0.90 or less to define abnormal, the \nsensitivity is 95% and specificity 99% for the diagnosis of \nPAD (LR+ = 95, LR- = 0.05) \n3. An ABI of0.71-0.9 =mild PAD; 0.51-0.70 =moderate \nPAD; 0.00-0.50 = severe PAD \nTreatment \nA. Risk factor modification: smoking cessation, control of hyper-\ntension and diabetes, treatment with a high-intensity statin \nB. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel reduces \nmyocardial infarction, stroke, and death from vascular causes; \nthere is no additional benefit with combination therapy. \nC. Cilostazol 100 mg twice daily increases walking distance on a \ntreadmill by 25% compared to placebo. \nD. Exercise, especially a supervised exercise program, can increase \nwalking by up to 150% over 3-12 months and should be \nconsidered flrst~line therapy. \nE. Revasculari2ation, either surgical or percutaneous transluminal \nangioplasty, is indicated for the following: \n1. Limb salvage in critical limb ischemia \n2. Claudication unresponsive to exercise and pharmacologic \ntherapy that limits patients' lifestyle or ability to work \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. F's pretest probablllty of PAD Is high. You order ABls, \nwhich shomild PAD (bilateral indices of 0 .89). After \nattending physical therapy for presumed spinal st1mosis \nfor 8 weeks, he reports some improvement in his exer-\ncise tolerance. although he still has dally leg pain. He has \nnot had sufficient relief from acetaminophen, naproxen, \nor trarnadol. An MRI scan shows moderate cent ral canal \nstenosis and neuroforaminal narrowing at L3, L4. and L5. \nYou encourage him to continue his exercise program, and \nplan a referral to a surgeon if he still has significant symp-\ntoms In 3 months. \n\n136 I CHAPTER 7 \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nSpinal Epidural Abscess \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is a patient with a history of diabetes or \ninjection drug use who has fever and back pain, followed by neun>-\nlogic symptoms (eg, motor weakness, sensory changes, and bawd \nor bladder dysfunction). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Pathogenesis \n1. Most patients have 1 or more predisposing conditions. \na. Underlying disease (diabetes mellitus [30% of patients \nwith epidural abscess]. injection drug use [4-37%], \nend-stage renal disease [2-13%], immunosuppressant \ntherapy [7-16%], cancer [2-15%], HIV [2-9%]) \nb. Invasive spine intervention, (surgery, percutaneous spine \nprocedure [14-22%]) or trauma \nc. Potential local or systemic source of infection (skin or \nsoft tissue infection, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, urinary \ntract infection, injection drug use, epidural anesthesia, \nindwelling vascular access) \n2. Infection occurs by hematogenous spread (most common), \ndirect spread from an infection in the vertebral column or \nparaspinal soft tissues, or by direct inoculation during a \nprocedure or trauma. \n3.

Bleeding due to platelet abnor-\nmalities, whether due to reduced number or abnormal function \nof platelets, is usually small vessel bleeding, and produces such \nfindings as petechiae, bruising, gum bleeding, or nosebleeds. The \nbleeding starts and persists immediately following the injury that \ninduces it. Platelet-related bleeding is generally not quantitatively \nsignificant (ie, platelet-related bleeding tends not to cause serious \nblood loss requiring red cell transfusions). Nonetheless, platelet-\nrelated bleeding can still be clinically important if a patient bleeds \na small amount into the brain {unusual unless the platelet count \nis< 10,000/mcL) or induces an abdominal hematomafrom vigorous \ncoughing, for example. By contrast, bleeding due to coagulation \nfactor deficiencies or inhibitors tends to be delayed; that is, a plate-\nlet plug sloWli or stops the bleeding immediately after an injury, \nbut the platelet plug is then not bolstered by the stable fibrin clot \nthat is meant to definitively stop the bleeding. Bleeding due to \ncoagulation factor abnormalities is more likely to be quantitatively \nsignificant, generally occurring in joints, the gastrointestinal (GI) \ntract, brain, retroperitonewn, or at sites of recent injury or medical \nor surgical intervention. \nA.

She has also noted some tiny red dots \non her ankles in the past week-they are not raised and \ndo not Itch or hurt. She notes that her last menstrual \nperiod was somewhat heavier than usual, and she has had \nan Intermittent headache over thi!: last 2 days. partlally \nrelieved by acetaminophen. Otherwise, she has taken \nno medications. On examination, she looks well and has \nnormal vital signs. Her oral examination shows evidence \nof recent gingival bleeding, and there are a fepalatal \npetechiae. She also has petechiae on her antecubital fos-\nsae and ankles. There Is no lymphadenopathy. Chest and \nabdominal examinations are normal, with no splenomegaly \nnoted. \nAt this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altematlvee, and 19 \nth11re a must not mlH diagnosis? Glv11n this \ndifferential diagnosis, what test& should be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThere are several pivotal points in Ms. Ks presentation that sug-\ngest her bleeding is due to a platelet disorder: the bleeding occurs \nimmediately after the trauma of tooth brushing, she has petechiae \non her skin, and the bleeding is small volume. \nThe second pivotal point is that her history further suggests that \nher platelet disorder is acquired. If she had a congenital platelet \ndisorder, such as von Willebrand disease, she might have had life-\nlong heavy menses and other manifestations of bleeding. In this \ncase, her symptoms just began 2 weeks ago. A platelet count will \nconfirm that her bleeding is related to thrombocytopenia, rather \nthan platelet d}'5function, which is less commonly seen. (If the \nplatelet count is normal, platelet dysfunction should be suspected, \nand a test such as the PFA-100 assay should be ordered. This test is \na reproducible screening tool for platelet function abnormalities. It \nmeasures the time to formation of a platelet plug in response to col-\nlagen along with adenosine diphosphate [ADP] or epinephrine.) \nThe most common cause of thrombocytopenia in a young woman \nwith no signs of systemic illness is idiopathic autoimmune throm-\nbocytopenia. Although Ms. Ks headache is mild and she looks well, \nTIP can present with headache and thrombocytopenia and also \ntends to occur in young women. Finally, it is critical to remem-\nber that the platelets are only 1 of the cell lines affected by bone \nmarrodisorders, and that a serious bone marrocondition \n(eg, acute leukemia) might first manifest as thrombocytopenia. A \nkey step, then, is to decide if the thrombocytopenia is isolated or \npart of a pancytopenia picture, such as one might encounter with \nacute leukemia. \nTable 8-1 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nMs. /'is laboratory tests Indicate a WBC of 5600/mcl. \nRBC of 3.9 milllon/mcl, Hb of 11 .2 g/dl, HCT of 33.5%, \nand platelet count8000/mcL.

The platelet count is low, with large platelets \nseen on peripheral blood smear; other cell lines are normal. Physical \nexam, other than the minor bleeding, is normal. \nDisease Highlights \nA. ITP is an autoimmune disorder primarily of young women. \nThis is the demographic group that commonly suffers from \nother autoimmune disorders such as SLE or thyroid disease. \nB. A better term might be autoimmune thrombocytopenic \npurpura, since some cases are not idiopathic but are secondary \nto other conditions, such as lymphoproliferative disorders, \ncollagen vascular disorders (eg, SLE), or infectious disorders \n(eg, chronic hepatitis or HN infection). \nC. The prevalence is approximately I 00 cases per million persons. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. ITP is a clinical diagnosis. \nB. A bone marroexamination is not required for diagnosis. \n1, If performed, it would likely shonormal or \nincreased megakaryocytes, indicating adequate platelet \nproduction and suggesting the thrombocytopenia \nis due to peripheral destruction of platelets in the \nreticuloendothelial system. \n2. A bone marroexamination should be done when the \npresentation is atypical, for example: \na. Patient has splenomegaly or significant lymphadcnopathy \nor other cytopenias \nb. The patient is older. \nC. Serum antiplatelet antibody tests are about 50-60% \nsensitive and not sufficiently specific to make the diagnosis \nofITP. \n1. They are not considered sufficiently reliable for general use \nin diagnosing ITP. \n2. If there is serious consideration of a drug-induced cause \nof immune thrombocytopenia, it may be possible to \ndemonstrate drug-related antiplatelet antibodies in \nreference laboratories. \nD. A successful clinical trial of corticosteroid therapy may also \nserve as strong evidence of the correct diagnosis of ITP. \nE. Serologic studies are indicated if SLE, hepatitis C, or HIV \ninfection is suspected. \nTreatment \nA. High~dose corticosteroid, such as prednisone or dexametha~ \nsone, is the initial treatment for all patients. \nB. Patients who do not respond to corticosteroids or whose \nthrombocytopenia recurs when the corticosteroids are stopped \nmay undergo splenectomy, which removes a site of antibody \nproduction as well as a site of reticuloendothdial system \ndestruction of antibody-coated platelets. \nC. In refractory cases, other immunosuppressants may be used, \nsuch as rituximab, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide. \nD. Thrombopoietin analogues such as romiplostim and eltrombopag \nhave become more widely used fur treatment of refractory \ncases ofITP. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMs. 11\\s WBC count and Hb are normal, eliminat ing leukemia \nas a possible diagnosis. Her blood smear does not sho\nschistocytes (seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), \nsuggesting that she does not have lTP. Further, her retlcu-\nlocyte product ion Index ls loand there are no spherocytes. \nsuggesting that she does not have Immune hemolytlc \nanemla accompanying t he Immune t hrombocytopenla.

Do othsr ttJete \nnsed to be dons to tJJCClude the alttJrnatlve \ndlagnoeee? \n\nAlternative Diagnosis: TIP \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with TTP appear systemically ill. The 5 classic manifesta-\ntions are thrombocytopenia; microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; \nneurologic abnormalities such as confusion, headache, lethargy, or \nseizures; fever; and acute kidney injury. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Only 2 or 3 of the classic manifestations are present in many \npatients. \nB. Thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia \nmust be present to diagnose TIP, regardless of whether the \nother manifestations are present. \nC. Neurologic abnormalities are present in about two-thirds of \npatients, acute kidney injury or kidney dysfunction in about \nhalf, and fever in about one-quarter. \nD. Pathophysiology \n1. The ADAMTS13 enzyme is responsible for cleaving \nultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers into smaller \ncomponents. \n2. An anti-ADAMTS13 antibody inactivates the enzyme; \nthe trigger for antibody formation is unknown. \n3. The lack of the enzyme leads to the ultra-large von \nWillebrand multimcrs causing platdet aggregation \nand clumping in the microcirculation, leading to \nthrombocytopenia. \n4. These clumps cause red blood cdls passing over them to be \nphysically damaged, leading to the characteristic finding on \nthe blood smear of schistocyres, or fragmented red blood cdls. \nEvidence-Bued Diagnosis \nA. A plasma test demonstrating reduced ADAMTS 13 activity \nand a positive test for the anti-ADAMTS13 antibody rdiably \nestablish the diagnosis. \nB. The diagnosis oflTP is made clinically, since the ADAMTS 13 \nassay result may take several days to return, and the disease has \ncritical morbidity and mortality if treatment is ddayed. \n1. Any patient with thrombocytopenia (usually bdo\n30,000/mcL) and evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis \n(schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, elevated serum \nlactate dehydrogenase (LD) level, reduced serum \nhaptoglobin level) should raise concern about TTP. \n2. If neurologic signs or acute kidney injury is present, the \ndiagnosis becomes even more likdy. \n3. The ~PLASMIC\" score is a way to predict the likelihood \nof finding a loADAMTS 13 activity level diagnostic \nforTTP. \na. It is based on the presence or absence of 7 clinical \nfeatures: \n(I) Platdet count< 30,000/mcL \n(2) Hemolysis \n(3) Absence of active cancer \n(4) Absence of solid organ or stem cell transplantation \n(5) Mean corpuscular volume < 90 fl \n(6) INR< 1.5 \n(7) Creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL \nBLEEDING DISORDERS I 143 \nb. If 6 or 7 of these features are present, the likelihood of \nADAMTS 13 activity being < 10% is very high. \nTreatment \nThink about TTP in patients with thrombocy-\ntopenia and signs of hemolytic anemia. \nA. Plasma exchange is the mainstay of treatment ofTTP. While \nit is complicated and expensive, it does not carry substantial \nmedical risk. \n1. Large volumes of plasma are removed from the patient and \nfresh plasma reinfused. \n2. This removes the antibody to ADAMTS 13 and provides \nplasma with a normal complement of the enzyme. \n3. It is possible to treat TTP initially with plasma infusion \nalone, but plasma exchange allows for infusion of much \nhigher volumes of plasma; hence, more efficient removal \nof antibody and infusion of enzyme. \n4. Plasma exchange is performed daily, typically for 7-14 days, \nwhile monitoring the platelet count and LD levels. \n5. Prior to the advent of plasma exchange, the mortality \nrate for TTP was about 90%. With plasma exchange, the \nsurvival rate is noabout 90%. \nB. lmmunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone or rituximab \nare also used in an effort to reduce the production of the \nanti-ADAMTS 13 antibody. \nTIP should be treated when suspected. A \ndefinitive diagnosis is not necessary to initiate \ntreatment. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMs. A's presentation does not meet criteria for TTP. Her \nbleeding is consistent with platelet-induced bleeding con-\nflrmed by her thrombocytopenla. There 15 no evidence to \n5ugge5t decreased production (no pancytopenla, medica-\ntion u5e or underlying condition) making platelet de5truc-\ntion most likely. Finally, thi5 appears to be im mune-medlated \nrather t han microangiopathic given the lack of schisto-\ncytes or hemolysis making t he diagnosis of ITP appear \nflrm. M5. A begln5 treatment wit h prednl5one at a do5e of \n1 m(:j/k(:l orally daily. After 1 week, her platelet count rlse5 \nto 40,000/mcL, and after 2 week5, to 130,000/mcL. She \nthen begin5 a predni50ne taper over many week5, and her \nplatelet count remains above 100 ,000/mcL. \nThe goal of therapy in ITP is a safe platdet count, typically a count \nabove 30,000/mcL, rather than a normal count. Ifit is not possible \nto taper prcdnisone off, or to a very lodose, while maintaining \na safe platelet count, alternative therapies such as splenectomy or \nthrombopoietin analogues are indicated, since the long-term risks \nof corticosteroids (infections, osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, \nmuscle weakness, electrolyte disturbances) should be avoided \nif possible. \n\n144 I CHAPTER 8 \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. J is a 62-year-old man who underwent a coronary \nbypas5 graft operation 1 week ago for severe coronary \nartery d lsease.

Given this \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests ehould 17e \nordsred? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe most common causes of nethrombocytopenia in hospi-\ntalized patients are medications, particularly heparin-induced \nthrombocytopenia (Hin, and sepsis. Therefore, the first steps \nin diagnosing thrombocytopenia in a hospitalized patient are to \nrevieprevious platelet counts to determine whether the thrombo-\ncytopenia is new, reviethe medication list, and look for vital signs \nsuggestive of sepsis. Because Mr. J has a history of autoimmune \nhemolytic anemia, it is also important to consider autoimmune \nthrombocytopenia as an accompanying autoimmune phenome-\nnon (also called Evans syndrome, characteri:zed by seeing sphero-\ncytes rather than schistocytes in the peripheral smear), although \nthis would otherwise be uncommon in his age group. Finally, he \ncould have cirrhosis due to his extensive alcohol intake over the \nyears, with hypersplenism causing mild-to-moderate thrombocy-\ntopenia. Chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia might also cause \nsplenic enlargement. If hypersplenism is the cause, his platelet \ncount at admission would probably have been somewhat low, \ntypically between 40,000/mcL and 120,000/mcL. Table 8-2 lists \nthe differential diagnosis. \nMr. J's vital signs are normal, and a recent nursing note \nreports that he finished his breakfast and looked fine. He \nis receiving antibiotics for the wound infection and sub-\ncutaneou5 heparin every 8 hour5 for prophylaxi5 again5t \ndeep venous thrombosis. His last platelet count was \n175,000/mcl 3 days ago.

There may be asso-\nciated thrombosis, either venous (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary \nembolism, venous limb gangrene) or arterial (cold digits or ememity). \nSkin necrosis at the site of heparin injections may also be seen. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Caused by the development of an antibody directed against \na heparin-platelet factor 4 complex; the antibody occurs \nmore commonly with unfractionated heparin than with low-\nmolecular-weight heparin. The antibody causes aggregation \nand activation of platelets, which paradoxically increases the \nrisk of thrombosis. \nB. Devdops in about 5% of patients who receive heparin. \nC. Surgical patients are at higher risk. \nD. HIT manifests between 5 and 10 days after starting any kind \nof heparin-full-dose intravenous heparin, low-dose prophy-\nlactic heparin, or even just heparin flushes to maintain patency \nof indwelling intravascular catheters. Thrombocytopenia may \ndevdop earlier in patients with recent heparin exposure. \n~ \nAny exposure to heparin, including small heparin \n,.,..... \nflushes, can lead to HIT. \nE. Thrombosis develops in about 50% of patients who have HIT, \nand the thrombosis may be evident at the same time as the \nplatelet count drop, though it may also be delayed by several \ndays or weeks. Thrombosis may be arterial (previously called \nthe white dot syndrome), although it is more often venous. \n\nF. The platelet count does not usually drop belo50,000/mcL \nin HIT; a lower platelet count suggests another etiology. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The most sensitive, readily available screening test is an enzyrne-\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-PF4 antibody. \n1. It is nearly 100% sensitive, although specificity is between \n75% and 85%. Thus, a negative test is very reassuring that \nHIT is not present, but false-positive tests are not uncommon. \n2. The serotonin-release assay (SRA) is more specific but not \nreadily available; it can be run if a false-positive ELISA is \nsuspected. \nB. Because the poor specificity of the anti-PF4 assay leads to \noverdiagnosis of HIT, a pretest probability scoring system \n(the 4~T's\") has been validated. \n1. Thrombocytopenia \na. Fall of platelets by> 50% and nadir> 20,000/mcL = \n2 points \nb. Fall of platelets by 30-50% or nadir 10-19,000/mcL = \n1 point \nc. Fall by< 30% or nadir< 10,000/mcL = 0 points \n2. Timing of platelet fall \na. Clear onset between days 5 and 10 after exposure, or \n< 1 clay if prior heparin exposure within 30 days = 2 points \nb. Consistent with fall between 5 and 10 days, but some \ndata missing, or fall > 10 days, or < 1 day if prior \nheparin exposure within 30-100 days= 1 point \nc. Fall at < 4 days and without recent exposure = 0 points. \n3. Thrombosis or other sequelae \na. Confirmed nethrombosis, skin necrosis, or acute \nsystemic reaction after IV un&actionated heparin \nbolus = 2 points \nb. Progressive or recurrent thrombosis, non-necrotizing \nskin lesions or suspected thrombosis that has not been \nproven = 1 point \nc. None of the above = 0 points. \n4. OTher causes for thrombocytopenia present: \na. None apparent = 2 points \nb. Possible = 1 point \nc. Definite = 0 points. \nS. Test interpretation: 0-3 points: loprobability; 4-5 points: \nintermediate probability; 6-8 points: high probability. \na. In 1 large series of 111 patients with a lopretest \nprobability of HIT using this scoring system, only 1 had \nclinically significant HIT antibodies (0.9%). \nb. In contrast, the overall rate of clinically significant \nHIT antibodies was 11.4% and 34% in those with \nintermediate and high scores, respectively. \n6. An online calculator is available at http://www.qxmd.com/ \ncalculate-online/hematology/hit-heparin-induced-\nthrombocytopenia-probability \nTreatment \nA. Heparin must be discontinued whenever HIT is suspected, \neven when the anti-PF4 assay result is not yet available. \nBLEEDING DISORDERS I 145 \nB. An alternative anticoagulant must be started to prevent \nHIT-associated thrombosis, regardless of whether the initial \nindication for anticoagulation is still present; generally, a direct \nthrombin inhibitor such as argatroban is used. \n1. Low-molecular-weight heparin may not be substituted: \nalthough the incidence of HIT with low-molecular-weight \nheparin is much lower than with unfractionated heparin, \nonce HIT occurs, there is too much risk for cross-reactivity. \n2. Similarly, warfarin should not be used until the platelet \ncount has recovered (this takes a fedays) but can then be \nstarted while the direct thrombin inhibitor is being given. \n3. Anticoagulation should continue for 2-3 months. \nC. Although not specifically approved for this indication, \nfondaparinux, a factor X inhibitor, has sometimes been used as \nan alternative anticoagulant in patients with HIT. \nD. Surprisingly, patients with a history of HIT may safely be \nreexposed to heparin, if necessary, after a year has passed \nand the antibody has presumably disappeared. This may be \nan issue particularly for patients requiring extracorporeal \ncirculatory support for cardiac surgery, for example. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nBefore you have finished reviewing Mr. J's chart, the nurse \npages you to report that he Is complaining of severe pain In \nhis right great toe. It Is cool and dusky when you examine It . \n~ \nHave you crossed a dlagn05tlc thresholc:i for \n1~r the leading hypothHls, HIT1 Have you ruled \nout the active alternatives? Do other tests \nneed to be done to exclude the altemative \ndlagnoeee7 \nThe findings of a painful, cool, and dusky toe suggest arterial occlu-\nsion. While post-cardiac surgery patients can have arterial emboli \nfrom a left ventricular clot or postoperative atrial fibrillation, the \ncombination of nethrombocytopenia, heparin exposure, and \nthrombosis points toward HIT. Mr. J's \"4T\" score is 8, consistent \nwith a high probability of HIT: 2 points for the degree of throm-\nbocytopenia, 2 points for the time course, 2 points for the presence \nof nethrombosis, and 2 points for lack of other apparent causes \nof thrombocytopenia (despite his alcohol history, his liver tests are \nnormal, making cirrhosis and hypersplenism unlikely, and ITP is \nnot associated with thrombosis). \nCASE RESOLUTION \nYou Immediately stop all heparin exposure and start \nMr. J on argatroban. His HIT ELISA assay Is posit ive. His \ntoe returns to normal, and his platelet count increases \nto 100,000/mcL within 4 days.

In addition to the specific GI causes of upper GI bleeding \ndiscussed in Chapter 19, GI Bleeding. it is important to consider \nwhether paticnu who arc bleeding have an underlying platdct or \ncoagulation disorder contributing to the bleeding. Ms. W does \nhave cirrhosis with splenom.egaly that could lead to thrombocy-\ntopenia due to splenic sequestration; however, the large volume of \nthe bleeding suggests a coagulation fu:tor disorder. \nThe prothrombin time (PT) measures what is commonly \ncalled the \"extrinsic\" clotting pathway (Figure 8-2), wherein tissue \nfactor from an injury activates fu:tor VII, followed by activation \nof the coagulation cascade through the \"common pathway\" factors \n(factors V, X. 11 [prothrombin] and I [flbrinogen)). Because the \nsource of tissue factor reagents used in the laboratory to trigger the \ncascade vary, the PT will vary among different laboratories when \ntesting the same sample. To overcome this problem of PT rcsults \nnot being comparable from one laboratory to another, the inter \nnational normalized ratio (INR) was devdoped, to standardize PT \nresults based on a constant associated with each laboratory reagent. \nThe INR, which is routindy reported along with the PT, allows the \nclinician to be confident that the data from different laboratories \narc comparable. \nThe activated panial thromboplastin time (a.PTT) measures \nwhat is commonly called the \"intrinsic\" dotting pathway, start-\ning with factor XII and working through factors Xl, IX, and VIII \nbefore entering the common pathway. \nIn the evaluation of a prolonged clotting time, either PT or \naP'IT, one considers whether only one test is prolonged, and which \nfactors contribute to each test. For exam.pie, an isolated prolonged \nPT suggests a dcflciency or inhibitor of factor VII, since that is the \nonly fu:tor unique to the PT as11ay. An isolated prolonged aPTT \nraises concern about the 4 f.acto\" that are unique to the iPTI' -\nfactors XII, Xl, IX, and YID. Prolongation of both the PT and \naPTI' raises concern either about the f.tctors in the common \npathway-I, II, V, and X-or a defect in multiple factors.

(While \ncongenital f.actor dcficienciu such as hemophilia certainly cause \n\nprolonged clotting times, these are far less commonly seen, and \npatients are generally well aware of them, making complex diag-\nnostic evaluations unnecessary.) In order to distinguish between a \nfactor deficiency and an inhibitor, it is often helpful to perform a \nmixing study, wherein one mixes 1: 1 the patient's plasma and nor-\nmal plasma, to see if the clotting time c:orrec:ts. If it does correct, \nthe normal plasma has provided the missing factor to the patient's \nplasma, indicating the abnormality is due to a factor deficiency. \nIf it does not correct, the implication is that an inhibitor in the \npatient's plasma is inactivating the clotting factor(s) from the \nnormal plasma. Suc:h inhibitors may be exogenous, suc:h as inad-\nvertent heparin in the mixture; or endogenous, suc:h as an acquired \nfactor inhibitory antibody. \nBased on the data we have so far, Ms. W's GI bleeding is most \nlikely from the upper GI trac:t, probably gastritis or ulceration \ninduced by use of the NSAID ibuprofen. Patients with cirrhosis and \nportal hypertension often develop esophageal and gastric varices, \nwhich can also be a cause of bleeding. The severity of the bleeding \nmay be exacerbated by a coagulopathy related to her cirrhosis. The \nhistory of poor appetite for a feweeks raises the consideration \nof vitamin K deficiency due to lack of intake, and the presence of \nsplenomegaly on examination suggests that thromboc:ytopenia due \nto splenic sequestration may also be contributing. \nTable 8-4 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nA CBC shows WBC 9400/mcl, Hb 7.8 g/dl, platelet count \n76,000/mcl. A chemistry profile shows mild elevation \nof the transaminases but is otherwise normal. Her CBC \n6 months ago showed an Hb of 11.7 g/dl and platelet \ncount of 80,000/mcl. Co~ulation studies include a PT of \n22 seconds (normal range 11-13 seconds). with an lNR \nof 1.8 (normal 0.9-1.2). The aPTf Is 39 seconds (normal \n24-34 seconds). \n~ \nIs the c:llnlc:al Information &Uffic:lent to make a \n1~JI\"\" diagnosis? If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nMs. W has the stable, moderate thromboc:ytopenia generally \nseen in patients with portal hypertension and hypersplenism. \nModerate thromboc:ytopenia suc:h as this does not substantially \nincrease the risk of bleeding, especially not the large volume GI \nbleeding she is experiencing. The coagulation abnormalities she \nhas c:an certainly contribute to large volume bleeding. \nLeading Hypothesis: Liver Disease-Induced \nCoagulopathy \nTatbook Presentation \nThe classic: presentation of liver disease-induced coagulopathy is \nvariable. Patients may be asymptomatic:, only discovered to have \na coagulopathy incidentally on coagulation laboratory studies. \nSpontaneous bleeding is uncommon, but anything that stresses \nthe patient (suc:h as an injury, an operative procedure, or perhaps \nNSAIO-induc:ed gastritis} may lead to more bleeding than one \nmight normally anticipate with that event in someone without \nliver disease. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Patients with liver disease-induced coagulopathy typically have \na disproportionately longer PT (and therefore higher INR) \nthan aPTT. \nBLEEDING DISORDERS I 147 \nTable 8-4.

The coagulopathy is caused by impaired production of clotting \nfactors by the diseased liver; the clotting factor with the shortest \nhalf-life, namely factor VII, would be expected to be most \nprominently affi:c:ted. Sinc:e the PT /INR is so sensitive to \nfactor VII levels, that test is more notably abnormal. \nC. Coagulopathy is seen primarily in patients with severe liver \ndisease. The liver has a considerable reserve, and only when the \nimpairment is severe does one find significant coagulopathy. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. In a patient with liver disease who is bleeding or in whom \nan invasive procedure is planned, the PT /INR and aPTT \nshould be c:hec:ked in order to screen for coagulation factor \ndeficiencies. \nI. If the screening tests are significantly prolonged, one should \nc:heck the levels of factor VII, factor V. factor II, factor IX, \nand factor X as well as flbrinogen to help determine whic:h \nreplacement therapy is most appropriate. \n2. If factor VII is lobut factor V normal, it suggests that \nvitamin K deficiency may be playing a role (especially if \n\n148 I CHAPTER 8 \nhistory notes poor appetite for several weeks, suggesting an \ninadequate intake of vitamin K during that time), whereas \nin severe liver impairment, both factors V and VII are \nreduced. \n3. Because all the clotting factors except factor VIII are \nproduced in the hepatocytes, all of them except factor VIII \nmay be loin severe liver disease. Factor VIII is typically \nnormal or even elevated in liver disease, a finding that may \ndistinguish liver disease from DIC, in which factor VIII \nis low. \nB. Another finding that may contribute to bleeding risk in severe \nliver disease is excessive flbrinolysis, the cause of which is a \ncomplex interplay between the production of and hepatic \nclearance of fibrinolytic activators and inhibitors. \nC. While it may seem paradoxical, there may also be an increased \nrisk of thrombosis in liver disease. Several findings may \naccount for this: reduction of the vitamin K-dependent \nanticoagulant proteins, protein C and protein S; and increases \nin factor VIII and sometimes von Willebrand factor. \nTreatment \nA. Correct the coagulopathy using fresh frozen plasma to replete \nclotting factors. If the plasma fibrinogen level is particularly \nlo(eg, < 100 mg/dL), infusion of cryoprecipitate may be \nhelpful. \nB. In severe cases, administration of recombinant activated factor \nVila may help stop the bleeding associated with liver disease; \nit is extremely expensive, however, and carries some risk of \ninducing thrombosis. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nAn esophaeogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) shows a duodenal \nulcer consistent with NSAID use. Herfactor VII level is 20%; \nfactor V level, 40%; factor II, 60%; factor IX, 50%; factor \nX. 55%; factor VIII, 122%. Ms. W is treated with a proton \npump Inhibitor and fresh frozen plasma. Her PT and ITT \nnormallze, and the bleeding stops. \nHave you crossad a diagnostic threshold for \nthe leading hypothesis, liver disease-Induced \ncoagulopathyf Have you ruled out the active \nalternatives? Do other teete need to 17e dons \nto 8Xclude the alternative diagnosssf \nAlternative Diagnosis: Vitamin K Deficiency \nTextbook Presentation \nThe usual presentation of vitamin K deficiency is a hospitalized \npatient who is found to have a prolonged PT /INR, rarely with \nbleeding manifestations. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The most common cause of vitamin K deficiency is inadequate \noral intake. \nB. Patients who have been hospitalized and need to start warfarin \ntherapy may require smaller than expected doses to achieve \ntherapeutic levels, because they may be unduly sensitive as a \nresult of baseline vitamin K deficiency. \nC. Vitamin K deficiency can also occur with the recent use of \nantibiotics that alter the gut flora's ability to conven ingested \nvitamin K to its absorbable form. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosia \nA. As with liver disease, patients with vitamin K deficiency have \nPT /INR levels disproportionately longer than aPTT levels. \nB. This is due to factor VII having the shortest half-life of the \nvitamin K-d.ependent factors (II, VII, IX, and X), thus making \nthe factor VII-dependent PT/INR more sensitive to vitamin K \nalterations. \nC. The aPTf will also go up eventually, as the levels of factors II, \nIX and X, with much longer half-lives, fall. \nTreatment \nA. Vitamin K repletion, either orally or parenterally, is the treatment \nof choice. \n1. If parenteral treatment is chosen, it should be administered \nsubcutaneously or intravenously-not intramuscularly. \n2. Intramuscular injections should be avoided in patients \nwith coagulopathies, in order to avoid the development \nof hematomas in muscles that can lead to neuropathy if a \nmajor nerve traverses the area. \nB. Vitamin K administration takes 18-24 hours to have its \neffect, so if a patient with vitamin K deficiency is bleeding, \nfresh frozen plasma or four-factor prothrombin complex \nconcentrate, which contains factors II, VII, IX, and X, \nmay be required. \nAlternative Diagnosis: DIC \nTextbook Presentation \nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, also called consump-\ntive coagulopathy) is a catastrophic activation of the coagulation \nsystem that classically presents as the abrupt onset of uncontrolled \nspontaneous diffuse bleeding from multiple sites (venipunc-\nture sites, catheter sites, endotracheal tubes, recent surgical sites) \nin patients with severe illness such as shock states, major trauma, \nsepsis, obstetric emergencies, and advanced cancer. \nDiaease Highlights \nA. The common denominator of conditions that cause DIC is \ntissue injury and activation of the clotting cascade via entry of \nprocoagulants into the circulation. \nB. A variety of conditions activate the clotting cascade. \n1. Trauma \n2. Advanced adenocarcinomas of any site, such as colon, \npancreas, or lung. \n3. Obstetric crises such as amniotic fluid embolism or \nplacental abruption. \n4. Acute promyelocytic leukemia, wherein the granules of the \nmalignant promyelocytes activate the clotting system. \nC. Although the classic presentation is major bleeding due \nto activation of the clotting cascade leading to secondary \nconsumption of clotting factors, in some cases clotting \nmanifestations may predominate. \n\n1. Patients with advanced cancer may have recurrent deep \nvenous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or arterial \nemboli in the extremities without signs of bleeding. \n2. This is considered chronic DIC. \nD. Renal, hepatic, and pulmonary dysfunction may accompany \nacute DIC. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. In acute DIC, consumption of clotting factors is demon-\nstrated by thrombocytopenia, prolongation of the PT /INR \nand aPTf, reduction of plasma flbrinogen level, and increases \nin D-dimer and fibrin degradation products (FDP). \nB. The D-dimer and FDP reflect flbrinolytic activity acting upon \nfibrin formed during the clotting process. \n1. D-dimer is the product oflysis of cross-linked fibrin. \n2. FDP is the product oflysis of both fibrin and fibrinogen. \n3. Fibrinogen levels belo100 mg/dL may correlate with \nbleeding risk. \nTreatment \nIf DIC is suspected, testing should include \nplatelet count, PT /INR, aPTf, fibrinogen, and \nD-dimer. \nA. Treat the underlying condition if possible. \nB. Replete dotting factors that have been depleted, with platelet \ntransfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate if \nfibrinogen is patticularly low. \nC. In rare instances, the use of low-dose heparin is considered. \nWhile it is logical to consider undertaking anticoagulation if \nthe initiation of the process was coagulation, the additional \nbleeding risk is of great concern, and efforts are generally \nfocused more on providing clotting factors while addressing \nthe underlying cause. \nBLEEDING DISORDERS I 149 \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nYou instruct Ms. W to avoid all aspirin product s and \nNSAID5.

The \ndifferential is best remembered anatomically, giving consideration \nto strucrures from the skin to the internal organs, including: \nA. Skin: Herpes zoster \nB. Breast \n1. Fibroadenomas \n2. Mastitis \n3. Gynecomastia \nC. MusculoskeJetal \n1. Costochondritis \n2. Precordial catch syndrome \n3. Tietze syndrome \n4. Pectoral muscle strain \n5. Rib fracture \n6.

Psychiatric \nThough strict algorithmic approaches toward chest pain often \nprove intractable in real-world clinical settln~, Figures 9-1 and 9-2 \nare useful for organizing an evaluation. This approach intentionally \nemphasi2es the 3 must not miss diagnoses-ACS, PE, AAS-while \navoiding the cognitive bias of \"playing the odds,\" favoring the \ncommon benign, rather than the uncommon serious, diagnoses. \nThe initial pivotal points in the evaluation of chest pain are the \nduration of symptoms and the patient's vital signs. Patients with \nnormal vital signs and subacute or chronic chest pain usually seek \nmedical attention in primary care setting while those with acute pain \nand vital sign abnormalities more commonly go to the emergency \ndepartment. The presence of coronary hean disease (CHD) risk fac-\ntors, ECG or chest Him abnormalities, symptoms consistent with \naortic dissection, or PE risk factors arc also important pivotal points. \n\nMr. W has a history of well-controlled hypertension and c:iia-\nbetes mellitus.

The initial pivotal points in this case are the chro-\nnicity and normal vital signs. Also important is that the character \nof the pain is typical for stable angina and there are risk factors for \nCHD. Noncardiac diagnoses should also be considered. GERD \nand musculoskeletal disorders are common causes of chest pain \nthat can mimic angina (exacerbated by activity, sensation of pres-\nsure). Pain from a mediastinal abnormality is also possible. The \nchronicity of his symptoms weighs against must not miss diagno-\nses (ACS, PE, and AAS). It is important to establish stability of \nthe patient's symptoms as UA would warrant urgent evaluation. \nTable 9-1 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nPhysical exam is entirely unremarkal'Jle except for mild, \nstable, peripheral neuropathy presumably related to diabe-\ntes.

Stable angina is a chest pain syndrome caused by a mismatch \nbetween myocardial oxygen supply and demand usually \ncaused by coronary attery stenosis. \nB. Stable angina is a common flrst presentation for CHD. \nC. Angina (stable and unstable) can also occur in the setting \nof normal or nearly normal coronary aneries and any of the \nfollowing: \nI. Anemia \n2. Tachycardia of any cause (atrial fibrillation, hyperthyroidism) \n3. Aortic srenosis \n4. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \nS. Heart failure (HF) (the result of high filling pressures \nleading to increased coronary resistance during diastole) \n~ \nIt is important to consider causes of angina \ny \nother than CHD. \nD. Although exertional chest pain is the most common symptom \nof stable angina, other presentations are possible. \n1. Eliciting factors other than exercise \na. Cold weather \nb. Extreme moods (anger, stress) \nc. Large meals \n2. Symptoms other than chest pain \na. Dyspnea \nb. Nausea or indigestion \nc. Pain in ateaS other than the chest (eg, jaw, neck, teeth, \nback, abdomen) \nd. Palpitations \ne. Weakness and fatigue \nf. Syncope \nE. The risk factors for CHD ate important to dicit in any patient \nwith concerning symptoms; the traditional risk factors are \n1. Male sex \n2. Age> 55 years in men and> 65 years in women \n3. Tobacco use \n4. Diabetes mdlitus \n5. Hypertension \n6. Abnormal lipid profile \na. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \nb. Elevated triglycerides \nc:. Elevated cholesterol/high-density lipoprorein (HDL) \nratio (normal< 5:1, ideally< 3.5:1). \nd. LowHDL \n7. Other risk factors \na. Other vascular diseases (peripheral, cerebral) \nb. Chronic kidney disease \nc:. Elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein \namong others) \nd. Lifestyle factors, such as a poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, \nobesity, and various psychosocial factors \nc. Cocaine use should be asked about because, although it \nis not a risk factor for CHD, it can cause both angina \nand Ml. \nAsking about the traditional cardiac risk factors \nshould be a part of the history for any patient \nwith chest pain. \nF. Stable angina and CHD in women \n1. Although the pathophysiology of stable angina is the same \nin men and women, stable angina raises some unique issues \nin women that deserve comment. \n2. Stable angina presents differently in women than in men. \na. Because angina usually presents in women at an older \nage than in men, there are more comorbid diseases to \ncomplicate the presentation. \nb. Women describe their chest pain differently, using terms \nlike \"burning\" and \"tender\" more frequently. \n3. There is good evidence that the diagnostic tests used for \nCHD, which are discussed later in this chapter, are less \naccurate in women than in men. \n4. Because there is a lower prevalence of disease among \nwomen, \na. Physicians often do not consider the diagnosis. \nb. Lower pretest probability leads to worse positive \npredictive value of diagnostic tests (there ate more \nfalse-positive results on noninvasive tests). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \n1. The first step in diagnosing CHD is taking an accurate \nhistory of the patient's chest pain. \n2. There are rdiable data on the prevalence of disease in \npatients with typical angina, atypical angina, nonanginal \nchest pain, and in patients who are asymptomatic. The \nanswers to the following questions categorize the patient's \nchest pain: \na. Is your chest discomfort substernal? (\"Where is your \npain?\") \n\nb. Are your symptoms precipitated by exenion? (\"Does \nyour pain come on or get worse when you walk, walk \nfast, or climb stairs?\") \nc. Does rest provide prompt relief of your symptoms \n(within 10 minutes)? (\"Does your pain get better \nwith rest?\") \n3. Patients who answer yes to all 3 questions are \nclassified as having typical angina, 2 positive answers \nas atypical angina, and 1 positive as nonanginal chest \npain. A patient who answers no to all questions is \nasymptomatic. \nUse the patient's own words when taking \na history {eg, pressure, burning, aching, \nsqueezing, piercing). \n4. The prevalence of CHD in each group is shown in \nTable 9-2. A variety of online tools, such as the Pooled \nCohort Risk Assessment Equations, can be used to \nestimate 10-year cardiovascular risk with a focus on \nidentifying high-impact risk reduction interventions. \nS. It is also useful to think of these data in terms oflow-, \nintermediate-, and high-risk groups. \nCHEST PAIN I 155 \n7. The remainder of the history should be aimed at collecting \nevidence that makes the diagnosis of CHD more likdy, \nsuch as \na. Cardiac risk factors \nb. Past history of cardiac disease \nc. Symptoms classic for other causes of chest pain \n8. Factors that make the diagnosis of CHD less likdy include \na. Unremitting pain of prolonged duration (days) \nb. Other explanations for the patient's symptoms \n9. Tests that should be performed on initial presentation \ninclude \na. Glucose and lipid profile to identify diseases that \nincrease the likdihood of chest pain being ischemic \nin origin. \nb. Hb and thyroid-stimulating hormone to identify other \ndiseases that may cause angina. \nc. Resting 12-lead decttocardiogram (ECG), looking for \nevidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or previous \ninfarction (Q-waves or ST-Twave changes) \ncl. Troponin, if recent angina! symptoms had been \npanicularly severe or long-lasting. \na. Low-risk (pretest probability< 15%): \n(1) All asymptomatic patients \nB. Cardiac diagnostic testing \n(2) Men with nonanginal chest pain who are younger \nthan 50 years \n(3) Women with nonanginal chest pain who are \nyounger than 60 years \n(4) Women under age 50 with atypical angina \nb. Intermediate-risk (pretest probability 15-85%): \n(1) Men over age 50 and women over age 60 with \nnonanginal chest pain \n(2) Any man and any woman over age 50 with atypical \nangina \n(3) Men under age 40 and women under age 60 with \ntypical angina \nc. High-risk (pretest probability> 85%): Men older than \n40 years and women older than 60 years with typical \nangina \n6. It is imponant to recognize that comorbidities can \nmarkedly influence the probability of disease. As an \nexample, the rate of CHD in a 55-year-old woman with \natypical angina goes from about 32% with no risk factors \nto 47% with 1 risk factor {eg, diabetes mellitus, tobacco \nuse, hypertension). \nTable 9-2.

Except in rare cases, patients with symptoms of stable \nangina should have further functional or anatomic exams \n(eg, stress testing or CT coronary angiogram, respectivdy) \nto detect inducible ischernia. \n2. The test is used for 2 purposes: to diagnose CHD and \nrisk stratify patients into treatment groups. That is, to \ndetermine whether patients should be treated with risk \nfactor reduction and medication only, percutaneous \ncoronary intervention (PCI), or coronary anery bypass \nsurgery. \n3. Decisions about treatment are based on a number of \nfactors, many coming from the results of cardiac diagnostic \ntesting: \na. The extent and severity of ischemia (most imponant) \nb. Other prognostic variables, such as aerobic ability, BP \nand heart rate response to exercise, and inducible left \nventricular dysfunction. \n4, All stress tests attempt to induce and detect myocardial \nischemia. \na. Myocardial ischemia may be induced by exercise, \ndobutamine, adenosine, or dipyridamole. \nb. Myocardial ischemia may be detected by ECG, \nechocardiogram, or nuclear suess imaging. \nAtypical Angina \nTypical Angina \nMale \nFemale \nMale \nFemale \n21.8 \n4.2 \n69.7 \n25.8 \n46.1 \n13.3 \n87.3 \n55.2 \n58.9 \n32.4 \n79.4 \n67.1 \n54.4 \n94.3 \n90.6 \nData from Diamond GA.

The sensitivity of an exercise test is decreased if the \npatient does not reach an adequate degree of exercise, \nas measured by the rate-pressure product. \n5. Exercise dectrocardiography is the simplest and least \nexpensive test though it less sensitive and specific than \nexercise tests that use more modern forms of imaging. \na. It requires a normal resting ECG. \nb. The sensitivity of the exercise stress test can be improved \n(at the cost of lower specificity) by reducing the degree \nof ST depression needed for a positive test. \n6. The sensitivity, specificity, and LRs of some of the various \ntests are shown in Table 9-3. (It should be noted that \nthe test characteristics of stress thallium and dobutamine \nechocardiography vary among healthcare centers.) \n7. Considerable debate exists regarding the use of anatomic \n(ie, CT coronary artery) versus functional (ie, exercise stress \nor stress imaging studies) exams for the initial evaluation \nofCHD. \n8. The decision whether to order a routine exercise test or \none with imaging is difficult. In general, reasons to obtain \nimaging are \na. Abnormal resting ECG \nb. Previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) \nsurgery or PCI \nc. A high pretest probability of disease. In these cases, only \na highly sensitive test can exclude disease and the test \nis being done more to risk stratify than to diagnoses \nCHD. \nBecause of the relatively losensitivity of \nECG stress tests, these should only be used \nto exclude the diagnosis of CHD in low-risk \npatients. \n9. Means of increasing coronary demand other than \nexercise (pharmacologic stress tests) are indicated for \npatients who are unable to exercise. They may also be more \naccurate in patients with a left bundle-branch block. \n10. A patient with stable angina might not undergo an exercise \ntest if he has a high likelihood of disease (a test therefore \ndoes not need to be done for diagnostic purposes) and \nwould not benefit from determining the distribution or \nseverity of the disease (usually because he would not, or \ncould not, undergo revasculariution). \nC. Angiography \n1. The gold standard for diagnosing CHD \n2. The indications for patients with stable angina to undergo \nangiography include \na. Abnormal stress test indicating substantial ischemia. \nb. lschemia at a loworkload on an exercise test. \nc. Diagnostic uncertainty after an exercise test. \n3. Patients may undergo angiography without first having \nan exercise test in 2 circumstances when they will almost \ncertainly require invasive therapy (PCI or CABG): \na. When their symptoms are disabling despite therapy. \nb. When they have HF. \nTreatment \nA. When stable angina is suspected, empiric therapy should be \nstarted. \nB. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and inhibit \ndisease progression. Stable angina carries a 3% per year risk \nof both MI and death. \nC. Lifestyle modification \n1. Smoking cessation \n2. Exercise {intensity guided by exercise testing) \n3. Weight loss \n4. Lofat, locholesterol diet \nD. Medications \n1. Symptomatic treatment. It is important to recognize that \npatients often need a combination of medicines to control \ntheir symptoms. \na. Beta-blockers \n(1) Generally flrst-line therapy \n(2) Decrease oxygen demand \nb. Verapamil or diltiazem are used in patients who cannot \ntolerate beta-blockers \nc. Nitrates \n(1) Increase coronary blood flo\n(2) Short-acting nitrates are generally prescribed to \nrdieve episodes of angina. \n(3) Long-acting nitrates are used as a second agent in \npatients with refractory symptoms. \nd. Ranolazine is sometimes used in combination with a \nbeta-blocker. It increases coronary blood flowithout \nlowering BP or heart rate. \n2. Interventions to slodisease progression \na. Aspirin (or clopidogrd in patients who are intolerant \nof aspirin or who have had PCI). \nb. High intensity HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) \ntherapy. \nc. BP control in patients with hypertension. \nd. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or \nangiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in patients at the \nhighest risk, such as those with diabetes or HF. \ne. Glycemic control in patients with diabetes \nE. Invasive treatment strategies (either via PCI or bypass surgery) \nare the mainstay of treatment for the acute coronary syndromes \ndiscussed below. For stable angina, they are used in patients \nwith more advanced disease. \n1. In low-risk patients (such as those with single vessel disease) \n\na. There is no difference in clinkal outcomes (death, MI) \nbetween patients managed medically or with PCI. \nb. Well-blinded studies suggest that these interventions \nmight not even have a significant effect on symptoms in \nthese low-risk patients. \n2. In moderate-risk patients (such as those with multivessd \ndisease but normal myocardial function} \na. PCI and CABG are about equal in terms of mortaliry \nand both are superior to medical therapy. \nb. PCI leads to more procedures. \n3. In high-risk patients (such as those with disease of the left \nmain coronary artery, 3 vessd disease, or 2 vessel disease \ninvolving the proximal left anterior descending artery) \na. Bypass surgery has a survival benefit compared to \nmedical therapy. \nb. For selected patients, PCI can have a similar outcome \nto surgery. \nc. Bypass surgery is superior in patients with diabetes. \n\nA tentative diagnosis of sta171e angina from CHD is made. \nLaboratol)' data are notable for normal blood counts and \nchemistries. There Is hwercholesterolemla (LDL. 1 36 mg/ dl; \nHDL, 42 mg/dL). Mr. W Is referred for a stress test. Because \nof his abnormal resting ECG, an exercise myocardial perfu-\nsion SPECT was performed. Although chest pain developed \nduring the test, his results were normal without evidence of \nmyocardial ischemia. \nHave you cros&&I a diagnatStic threshold for \nthe leading hyPOthesl5, 5tat11e anglna1 Have \nyou ruled out the active altematlvH1 Do \nother t85ts need to be done to e><clude the \nalternative dlagnoeH1 \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nThe results of the patient's exercise test are surprising. Stable angina \nremains high in the differential despite the normal stress test but \nalternative diagnoses must be considered. The intermittent nature \nof the pain and the lack of constitutional symptoms both make a \nmediastinal lesion unlikely. The absence of a recent injury, change \nin activiry or reproducible pain on physical exam moves muscu-\nloskeletal pain down on the differential. GERD is a common cause \nof chest pain and should be considered. \nAlternative Diagnosis: GERO \nTextbook Presentation \nHeartburn (a burning, substernal, chest discomfon) is usually the \npresenting symptom in a patient with GERD. Other classic symp-\ntoms are regurgitation or dysphagia; chest pain is a common alter-\nnative presentation. Patients often report that their symptoms are \nworst at night and after large meals. \nAlthough dysphagia is a common presentation of GERD, its \npresence raises the possibiliry of an obstructing lesion and thus \nmandates prompt evaluation, usually with upper endoscopy. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The symptoms of GERD are so well-known that some \npatients diagnose themselves before visiting a physician. \nCHEST PAIN I 157 \nB. GERD is a common cause of chest pain. \nC. GERD can be further classified as either erosive or nonerosive \nbased on endoscopic examination findings. \nD. There are GI and non-GI complications of GERD. \nI. GI \na. Esophagitis \nb. Stricture formation \nc. Barrett esophagus \nd. Esophageal adenocarcinoma \n2. Non-GI \na. Chronic cough \nb. Hoarseness \nc. Worsening of asthma \nE. Esophageal disorders, other than GERD, might also present as \nchest pain. \nI. Esophagitis or esophageal ulcer \na. Ofi:en causes odynophagia \nb. Multiple causes include infection and pill esophagitis. \nc. Common causes of pill esophagitis include \nbisphosphonates, tetracyclines, nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and potassium. \n2. Esophageal cancer \na. Ofi:en associated with dysphagia \nb. Smoking, alcohol use, and chronic reflux are risk factors. \n3. Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome). Often presents \nwith acute pain after retching. \n4, Esophageal spasm and motiliry disorders. Often present \nwith intermittent chest pain and dysphagia. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Cardiac causes should be excluded in patients with chest \npain before beginning a GI evaluation. \nB. GERD should be high in the differential diagnosis of \nchest pain when heartburn, regurgitation, or dysphagia \nis present or when other commonly associated symptoms \nor complications (eg, chronic cough and asthma) are \npresent. \nC. Identifying factors that exacerbate the symptoms of GERD \nis helpful both in diagnosis and management. Such factors \ninclude: \nI. Ingesting large (especially fatty) meals \n2. Lying down after a meal \n3. Using tobacco \n4. Eating foods that rdax the lower esophageal sphincter \na. Chocolate \nb. Alcohol \nc. Coffee \nd. Peppermint \nD. Historical features help differentiate esophageal from cardiac \nchest pain. \nI. A small study analyzed the prevalence of several historical \nfeacures in 100 patients in an emergency department with \neither esophageal or cardiac chest pain. \n2. The differences that reached statistkal significance are \nlisted in Table 9-4. Although the study was small, the data \nare instructive. \n\n158 I CHAPTER 9 \nTable 9-4. Prevalence of symptoms in patients with \ncardiac and esophageal chest pain. \nSymptom \nLateral radiation \nPrevalence (%) \nAmong patients \nwith cardiec \nouse \nAmong patients \nwith esophegeal \ncause \n----------------------------------\nMore than 1 spontaneous \n50 \nepisode per month \n-------------------------------------------------------- \nPain persists as ache for \nseveral hours \n78 \nNighttime wakening caused \n61 \nby pain \n-------------------------------------------------------- \nProvoked by swallowing \n39 \n-------------------------------------------------------- \nProvoked by recumbency or \n61 \nstooping \n---------------------------------------------------- \nVariable exercise tolerance \n39 \nPain starts after exercise \n33 \ncompleted \n-------------------------------------------------------- \nPain relieved by antacid \n1 O \n-------------------------------------------------------- \nPresence of heartburn \n78 \nPresence of regurgitation \n67 \n-------------------------------------------------------- \nPresence of GI symptoms \n83 \nGi, gastrointestinal. \n3. From these data, it is clear that history cannot differentiate \ncsophageal chest pain from pain due to cardiac ischemia. \nThat said, pain that occurs with swallowing, is persistent, \nwakes the patient from sleep, is positional, and is associated \nwith heartburn or regurgitation is more likely to be of \ncsophageal origin. \n4. Note that only 83% of patients with an esophageal cause \nof pain in this study had GI symptoms (ie, heartburn, \nregurgitation, dysphagia, or vomiting). \nS. Certain characteristics generally thought to suggest a \ncardiac origin of pain were nearly equally common in \npatients with cardiac and esophageal causes of chest pain. \na. Radiation to the left arm: 38% of patients of cardiac \ncause; 33% of patients with esophageal cause. \nb. Exacerbation with exercise: 73% of patients of cardiac \ncause; 67% of patients with esophageal cause. \nc. Relief with nitroglycerin: 62% of patients of cardiac \ncause; 5 5% of patients with esophageal cause. \n6. The effect of nitroglycerin in relieving chest pain has \nconsistently been found to be useless in differentiating anginal \nchest pain from esophageal or other causes of chest pain. \nResponse to nitroglycerin should not be used \nas a diagnostic test in the evaluation of chest \npain. \nE. Esophagcal pH testing, the gold standard for the diagnosis of \nGERD, is seldom necessary. \nF. The combination of a suspicious history and consistent \nendoscopic findings has a 97% specificity for GERD. \nG. Suggestive symptoms and response to therapy is generally \nconsidered diagnostic. \nH. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be done when \npatients have \n1. Alarm symptoms \na. Dysphagia \nb. Odynophagia \nc. Weight loss \nd. Gastrointestinal bleeding \ne. Iron deficiency anemia \n2. Signs suggestive of complicated disease including \na. Early satiety \nb. Vomiting \nc. Excra-esophageal symptoms \nd. Chest pain of unclear etiology \ne. Long-standing symptoms of reflux (Patients are at risk \nfor Barrett esophagus.) \nf. Patients require long-term therapy. \ng. Patients respond poorly to appropriate therapy. \nI. Ambulatory pH monitoring is useful in limited settings: \n1. In patients with symptoms of GERD and a normal \nendoscopy. \n2. To monitor therapy in refractory cases. \nTreatment \nA Lifestyle modification \n1. Weight loss is recommended if patient is obese \n2. Head of bed elevation. Elevate the entire head of the bed; \nadding extra pillows may actually worsen reflux. \n3. Avoid reclining for 2-3 hours of eating \n4. Routine, complete elimination of foods with the potential \nto trigger reflux is no longer recommended. \nB. Pharmacologic \n1. An 8-week course of once-per day proton pump inhibitors \n(PPis) is considered first-line for erosive esophagitis reflux \ndisease or patients with symptoms severe enough to prompt \na physician visit. \na. Partial responders may escalate to twice daily dosing \nb. Maintenance PPI therapy (at the lowest effective dose) \nshould be reserved for patients who reven to having \nsymptoms after proton pump inhibitor is discontinued. \n2. H2-receptor blockers may be used for maintenance therapy \nin patients with nonerosive disease \n3. Motility agents (such as metoclopramide) are useful in \npatients who need adjuvant therapy or who have significant \nsymptoms of regurgitation. These should be reserved for \npatients with endoscopy-proven GERD. \nC. Surgical: Antireflux surgery has a very small role limited to \n1. Nonresponders \n2. Severe disease \n3. Patients requiring long-term therapy \nBecause GERD is a common cause of chest \npain, if the suspicion of the disease is high, it \nis appropriate to prescribe an empiric course of \nPPis after more ominous causes of chest pain \nhave been ruled out. \n\nCASE RESOLUTION \nPrior to the stress test, Mr. W's probability of having CHD was at \nleast 92% (see Table 9-2). It is important to understand why the \nstress test was done in this case. The diagnosis of coronary disease \nwas essentially made by the history and physical. The stress test was \nmeant to guide therapy. Considering a pretest probability of92%, \nand a LR- of about 0.15 for the stress test, the posttest probability \nis 60%. This is still well above the test threshold for a potentially \nfatal disease like CHD. \nDespite the results of the stress test, stable angina was con-\nsidered more likely than GERD. Mr. W was given aspirin and \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. G is a 68-year-old woman with a history of hyperten-\nsion who arrives at the emergency department by ambu-\nlance complaining of chest '1urning that began 6 hours ago. \nTwo hours after eating, moderate (5/10) chest discomfort \ndeveloped. The pain begins In her mid-chest and radiates to \nher back. She initially attri1:7uted the pain to heartl:7um and \nused antacids. Despite multiple doses over 3 hours, there \nwas no relief.

Referring to Figure 9-2, multiple \"must not miss\" diagno-\nses including ACS, AAS, and PE, must be considered. Given the \npatient's presentation, age, and risk factors, ACS is most likely. \nAAS is also possible given the patient's history of hypertension and \nthe pain's radiation to her back, though the progressive onset of \nthe pain is somewhat atypical for AAS. Though PE remains on the \ndifferential, there is nothing in the presentation that specifically \nraises the likelihood of this must not miss diagnosis. Other less \nlife-threatening diagnoses, such as esophageal spasm, GERD, and \npancreatitis, should also be included on the differential diagnosis \n(Table 9-5). \nWhile the physical exam cannot reliably distinguish ACS, AAD, \nand PE, a brief, yet thorough, exam is recommended to identify \nhemodynamic instability, highly specific signs of a life-threatening \ndiagnosis, or precipitating causes.

If not, what other lnfonnation do \nyouneed7 \nLeading Hypothesis: Acute Ml \nTextbook Presentation \nThe textbook presentation of an acute MI is a middle-aged man \nwith risk factors for CHO with crushing substernal chest pressure, \ndiaphoresis, nausea, shortness of breath, and a feeling of impending \ndoom. Unfortunately, this textbook description does not account \nfor the frequency of MI in women, younger and older patients, and \nthe frequency of atypical presentations. \nDisease Highlights \nA. MI occurs when there is a prolonged failure to perfuse an area \nof myocardium leading to cell necrosis. \nB. Most commonly occurs when a coronary plaque ruptures \ncausing thrombosis and subsequent blockage of a coronary \nartery. \nC. The universal definition of MI describes 5 subtypes of MI \nbased on their etiology: \n1. Type 1: Spontaneous MI due to a primary coronary event \n2. Type 2: MI secondary to ischemia due to either increased \noxygen demand or decreased supply, eg, coronary artery \nspasm, anemia, or arrhythmias \n3. Type 3: Sudden unexpected cardiac death, including \ncardiac arrest, often with symptoms suggestive of \nmyocardial ischemia \n4. Type 4: MI associated with PCI or stent thrombosis \n5. Type 5: MI associated with CABG \nD. Mis are broadly classified as either STEMI or non-ST-\nsegment elevation MI (nSTEMI) \n1. STEMI \na. Involves transmural ischemia or infarction \nb. Typically caused by complete occlusion of a coronary \nartery \nc. Initial diagnosis of STEMI involves strict 12-lead \nECG criteria that are sufficient for initiating timely \nreperfusion therapies. \n2. nSTEMI \na. Less severe, usually injuring only subendocardial tissue \nb. Typically caused by incomplete occlusion of a coronary \nartery \nc. Higher subsequent risk for STEMI than for patients \nwithSTEMI \nTable 9-6. Criteria for diagnosing acute Ml. \n1. A rise and fal I of cardiac bfomarkers (preferably troponln) with at \nleast 1 value above the 99th percentile of the URL along with 1 of \nthe following: \n11. Symptoms of ischemia \nb. ECG changes consistent with neischemia \nc. Development of pathologic Q waves \nd. Imaging evidence of neloss of viable myocardium or \nmyocardial function \n2. Sudden cardiac death accompanied by ECG changes, angiographic \nfindings, or autopsy findings supporting Ml as the cause \n3. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers above 3 times the 99th percentile \nof the URL in the setting of PCI \n4. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers above 5 times the 99th percentile \nconsistent with Ml, angiographic evidence of Ml, or imaging \nevidence of neloss of viable myocardium of myocardial function \n5. Pathologic evidence of an Ml \nMl, myocardial infarction; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; URL. upper \nreference limit. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnostic criteria for acute MI have been clearly \nestablished. There are 5 criteria that vary somewhat, based \npartly on the subtype of MI. They are shown in Table 9-6. \nB. Clinical findings suggestive of MI \n1. Pretest probability \na. About 15% of patients who arrive at the emergency \ndepartment complaining of chest pain are having an Ml. \nb. About 33% of patients admitted to the hospital with \nsuspicion of an MI are found to be having one. \nc. About 50% of patients admitted to the cardiac care unit \nwith suspicion of an MI are found to be having one. \nd. Types of chest pain that decrease the likelihood of \nMI include pleuritic pain, sharp or stabbing pain, or \npositional pain. \ne. Historical and physical exam features are never sufficient \nto diagnose an MI and only {nearly) exclude MI in \nthe lowest risk patients. Test characteristics for some \ncommon signs and symptoms appear in Table 9-7. \nC. ECG findings \n1. Guidelines recommend an ECG be performed and \ninterpreted within 10 minutes of a patient's arrival at an \nemergency department when an MI is suspected. \n2. STEMI diagnostic criteria include \na. NeST elevation at the J point in 2 contiguous leads \n> 1 mm (0.1 m V) in all leads except V2--V3 \nb. NeST elevation V2-V3 of~ 2 mm in men younger \nthan 40 years or~ 1.5 mm in women \nc. New, or presumed new, left bundle branch block \n3. The presence of reciprocal ST depression helps confirm \ndiagnosis of STEM!. \n4. Prevalence rates of MI among emergency department \npatients with chest pain and various ECG findings are \na. 80% for neST elevation of 1 mm \nb. 20% for neST depression or T wave inversion \n\nTable 9-7.

The test characteristics for some ECG findings in patients \nwith acute chest pain are: \na. NeST elevation> 1 mm, LR+ = 5.7-53 \nb. NeQ wave, LR+ = 5.3-24.8 \nc. Any ST elevation , LR+ = 11.2 \nd. NeQ or ST elevation, LR+ = 11 \ne. Any ECG abnormality, LR- = 0.04 \nD. Cardiac biomarkers {enzymes) \n1. The diagnosis of MI requires the presence of elevated \ncardiac biomarker concentrations in peripheral blood \nsamples. \n2. Historically, cardiac biomarker panels include serum creatine \nkinase MB subunit (CK-MB) and troponin. Increasingly, \ncenters are relying on troponin or high-sensitivity troponin \nmeasurements to make the diagnosis. \n3. These tests are highly reliable in diagnosing Ml. \n(Note that the definition of MI is based on enzyme \nresults whenever they are available.} \na. Troponin: sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 98%; LR+, 48; \nLR-, 0.05. \nb. Serial CK-MB in the first 24 hours: sensitivity, 99%; \nspecificity, 98%; LR+, 50; LR-, 0.01. \n4. Troponin levels in patients with kidney disease \na. Patients with kidney disease often have elevated troponin \nlevels raising the risk of false-positive tests for Ml. \nb. Patients with elevated troponin levels at baseline will \nstill have a diagnostic rise and fall with Ml. \nc. In patients with chronic kidney disease, higher baseline \ntroponin levels are predictive of poor cardiovascular \noutcomes. \nE. Atypical presentations \n1. Although the combination of symptoms, ECG findings, \nand enzymes make most Mis easy to diagnose, about \n2% of patients with acute MI are not diagnosed and are \ndischarged from the emergency department. \nCHEST PAIN I 161 \n2. Failure to recognize an MI results in worse outcomes for \npatients and is a common cause of medical negligence claims. \n3. Mis most commonly go unrecognized when they present in \nunusual ways or in people not expected to have Ml. \n4. A patient with an MI or UA who is mistakenly discharged \nis most likely to \na. Be a woman younger than age 5 5 \nb. Be non-white \nc. Have a chief complaint of shortness of breath \nd. Have a nondiagnostic ECG \nS. The most common alternative presentations of MI are \nlisted below. MI should be considered in patients being \ndischarged from the emergency department with any of \nthese diagnoses: \na. HF \nb. Stable angina \nc. Arrhythmia \nd. Atypical location of pain \ne. Central nervous system manifestations (symptoms of \ncerebrovascular accident) \n Nervousness, mania, or psychosis \ng. Syncope \nh. Weakness \nL Indigestion \n6. Mis may present differently in women. \na. Women are more likely than men to present without \nchest pain (42% vs 30.7%). \nb. Women often report prodromal symptoms, such as \nfatigue, dyspnea, and insomnia. \nc. Oyspnea, weakness, and fatigue are common presenting \nsymptoms. \nd. Gender-based differences becomes less pronounced as \npatients age (ie, both men and woman present more \nfrequently without chest pain}. \ne. Risk Stratification. Given the wide array of atypical \npresentations for ACS and the risks involved in a \nmissed diagnosis, risk stratification tools have been \ndeveloped and tested to help risk stratify patients \nand support clinical decision making such as the \nTIMI and HEART scores discussed in the section \non unstable angina. \nTreatment \nMI can present in many different ways. A high \nindex of suspicion should always be present. \nMI is most likely misdiagnosed in certain \ngroups of patients (elderly, women, minorities, \nthose with diabetes). \nA. The following applies to the treatment of STEMI. The man-\nagement of nSTEMI is different and is discussed in the next \nsection on UA. \nB. Medications \n1. Antiplatelet agents: aspirin, P2Y12 receptor blockers (eg, \nclopidogrel) and, in patients undergoing primary PCI, a \nglycoprotein Ilb/Illa inhibitor \n2. Anticoagulation: Unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-\nweight heparin, fondaparinux, bivalirudin \n\n162 I CHAPTER 9 \n3. Beta-blockers \n4. Oxygen in patients who are hypoxic \n5. Nitroglycerin \n6. High-intensity HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) \n7. Other therapy based on presentation \na. Opioids fur patients still in significant pain afi:er \nischemia is maximally treated \nb. Atropine fur patients with pathologic bradycardia \nc. Antiarrhythmic agents \nC. Reperfusion with either primary PCI or systemic throm-\nbolysis (only if PCI is not available within 2 hours of \npresentation) \n1. Primary PCI with stent placement is the most efficacious \ntreatment. \n2. Both PCI and thrombolysis are most effective when \ncompleted within 12 hours of symptom onset. \n3. PCI has lower mortality {even in patients who must \nbe transferred-albeit quickly-to a hospital with the \ncapability) \n4. PCI has significantly lower risk of serious bleeding \ncomplications, such as hemorrhagic stroke \n5. The ability to do primary PCI depends on the presence of \nan intcrventional cardiology team who can rapidly bring \nthe patient to the catheterization laboratory. \nD. Following reperfusion, various medications have been shown \nto improve survival rate including \n1. Beta-blockers \n2. ACE inhibitors \n3. Aspirin \n4. P2Y12 receptor blockers (duration based on intervention \nand risk of bleeding) \n5. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors< 70 mg/dL \n6. Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitors are recommended for \npatients with Mis who undergo stenting. \nE. Outcomes \n1. Women who suffer an MI are more likely to die. Recent \ndata shoan in-hospital mortality rate of 14.6% for \nwomen and 10.3% for men. \n2. The cause of this disparity is multifactorial but includes the \nfact that patients without chest pain receive delayed and \nless aggressive care. \n3. The mortality difference becomes less pronounced and \neventually reverses with age. \n4. An exercise test is also recommended within 3 weeks of \nan MI in patients not undergoing PCI or angiography for \ninformation on prognosis, functional capacity, and risk \nstratification. \nHave you cro9sed a dlagn09tlc thre9hold \nfor the leading hypothesis, acute Ml? Have \nyou ruled out the active altematiw&? Do \nother teete need to be done to exclude the \naltematlve diagnoses? \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nThe ST depression is consistent with cardiac ischemia but does not \nsatisfy the strict criteria for STEMI. In addition, ST depression is \nless specific than ST elevation and does not conclusivdy make the \ndiagnosis of an acute Ml; the diagnosis will be confirmed when \ncardiac enzyme results become available. The abnormal ECG cer-\ntainly makes the alternative diagnosis, UA, quite likely if MI is \nexcluded. Aortic dissections also can cause cardiac ischemia, so this \ntoo must remain on the differential. \nAlternative Diagnosis: UA or nSTEMI \nTextbook Presentation \nUA and nSTEMI classically present with neor worsening symp-\ntoms of CHD and are only differentiated by the absence (UA) or \npresence (nSTEMI) of myocardial enzyme elevation in peripheral \nblood samples. \nDisease Highlights \nA UA is defined as angina that is new, worsening in severity or \nfrequency, or occurs at rest. \nB. Pathophysiology \nI. Primarily caused by acute plaque rupture fullowed by \nplatelet aggregation \na. 67% of episodes occur in arteries with < 50% stenosis. \nb. 97% occur in arteries with < 75% stenosis. \n2. Caused less commonly by changes in oxygen \ndemand or supply (eg, hyperthyroidism, anemia, \nhigh altitude) \nC. The diagnosis of UA can be difficult, often depending \non a careful history to differentiate stable angina \nfrom UA. \nD. The clinician seeing a patient with UA or a nSTEMI must \nI. Recognize that the patient has an ACS \n2. Initiate care \n3. Determine the patient's risk of progressing to an MI or \ndeath \n4. Treat accordingly \nE. Vasospastic angina \nI. Vasospastic angina (also called Prinzmetal or variant \nangina) is a phenomenon that presents similarly to UA. \n2. Patients periodically have episodes of cardiac ischemia \nwith ST elevation. \n3. The attacks \na. Are often associated with chest pain or other ischemic \nsymptoms \nb. Resolve spontaneously or with nitroglycerin \nc. May occur in normal or diseased coronary arteries \nd. Can result in MI or death {often secondary to \narrhythmia) \ne. Often occur at the same time each day \n4. Vasospastic angina is usually diagnosed clinically but can \nalso be diagnosed by inducing it with ergonovine infusion \nin the catheterization laboratory. \n5. Vasospastic angina is treated effectivdy with calcium \nchannel blockers and nitrates. \n\nVasospastic angina should be considered in \npatients whose symptoms are consistent with \ncardiac ischemia and occur at about the same \ntime each day. The diagnosis should also \nbe considered when transient ST elevations \ndevelop. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. There are 3 presentations ofUA: \n1. Rest angina \n2. New-onset (< 2 months) angina \n3. Increasing, or accelerating, angina \nB. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart \nAssociation have endorsed a number of features or findings \nthat increase the likelihood that a patient's symptoms represent \nan ACS, including \n1. Chest or left arm pain that reproduces prior angina \n2. History of CHD \n3. Transient mitral regurgitation murmur \n4. Hypotension \nS. Diaphoresis \n6. Pulmonary edema \n7. Crackles \nC. Appropriate risk stratification ensures that the patient is \ntriaged to the proper location for care (ICU, inpatient ward, \nhome) and receives the most beneficial therapy. \nD. Clinical risk scores can be helpful for stratifying patient \ncardiac risk. The TIMI score (Table 9-8) for UA/nSTEMI is \nprobably the most widely known of these scores. It was orig-\ninally derived from a cohort of patients receiving treatment \nfor ACS and thus should not be applied to patients with \nundifferentiated chest pain. However, it can be useful in risk \nstratifying patients to different treatment (conservative versus \ninvasive) once the diagnosis of ACS has been established. \nTable 9-8. Percent all-cause mortality. \nTIMI Score' \n0-1 \n3 \ns \n6-7 \nAll-cause mortality, n- or nicurnnt \nMl, or severe or recurrent ischemia \nrequiring urgent revascularlutlon \nwithin 14days \n4.7 \n8.3 \n13.2 \n19.9 \n26.2 \n40.9 \n'Patients receive 1 point for each of the following variables: age;;., 65,;;., 3 cardiac risk \nfactors, prior coronary stenosis of;, 5096, ST-segment deviation on admission ECG, ;, 2 \nanginal events in preceding 24 hours, use of aspirin in previous 7 days, elevated cardiac \nbiomarkers. \nMl, myocardial infarction; nSTEMI, non-ST-segment elevation Ml; TIMI, lhrombolysis in \nMyocardial Infarction; UA, unstable angina. \nCHEST PAIN I 163 \n1. Modern calculators like the HEART Score (Table 9-9) \nare more useful for estimating the risk of a major cardiac \nevent within 6 weeks among patients with symptoms \nsuggestive of ACS. The HEART score has also been \nvalidated within a variety of clinical pathways designed \nto identify low-risk cardiac patients suitable for discharge \nfrom the emergency department. \n2. Other characteristics that portend high risk include: \na. Recurrent angina or ischemia at rest or with low-level \nactivities despite intensive medical therapy \nb. Elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin) \nc. Signs or symptoms of HF or neor worsening mitral \nregurgitation \ncl. High-risk findings from noninvasive testing \ne.

Patients whose risk stratification (generally the TIMI score} \nidentifies them as having a lorisk of death or complications \nshould undergo conservative management strategy. \nH. Unstable patients need urgent coronary angiography. \nI. Stable patients (no ongoing ischemia, arrhythmias or \ndecreased ejection fraction on echocardiogram} should have \na stress test to determine whether angiogtaphy is indicated. \n1. If the stress test finds the patient to be at lorisk, the \npatient can be discharged and treated medically (aspirin, \nclopidogtel, beta-blockers, and an HMG-CoA reductase \ninhibitor}. \n2. Patients found to be at higher risk benefit from an early \ninvasive strategy that includes angiography to determine \nfurther management, generally PCI or CABG. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection \nTextbook Presentation \nThe textbook presentation of an aonic dissection is an older man \nwith a history of hypenension and possibly atherosclerotic disease \nwho complains of \"tearing\" chest or back pain. The pain might be \nassociated with vascular complications such as syncope, stroke, car-\ndiac ischemia, or HF secondary to acute aortic regurgitation. On \nphysical exam, there is asymmetry in the upper extremity BPs, and \nthe chest radiograph shows a widened mediastinum. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Dissection begins with a tear in the aonic intima allowing \nblood to dissect between the intima and media. \nB. Risk factors \n1. Hypertension, present in 72% of patients \n2. Atherosclerosis, present in 31 % of patients \n3. Known aonic aneurysm, present in 16% of patients \n4. Prior aonic dissection (6%) \n5. Diabetes (5%) \n6. Marfan syndrome (5%) \n7. Cocaine we is associated with dissections in younger \npatients {mean age 41) \nIn addition to MI, thoracic aortic dissection \nshould be considered in the differential of a \nyoung hypertensive patient who has chest pain \nafter using cocaine. \nC. Aortic aneurysms (that have not dissected} are usually \ndetected while they are asymptomatic on a chest radiograph. \nThey may also present with aortic regurgitation, pain, or \nthrough impingement on other structures such as the trachea, \nesophagus, or recurrent laryngeal nerve. \nD. Symptoms of dissection include pain as well as symptoms \nof vascular complications of the dissection. The type of \ncomplication depends on what type of dissection occurs. \nE. Type A dissections involve the ascending aona with or without \nthe descending aorta. \nI. Account for about 60% of dissections \n2. Carry a monality of about 35% \n3. May be associated with \na. Acute aortic regurgitation \nb. Myocardial ischemia due to coronary occlwion \nc:. Neurologic deficits \nd. Cardiac tamponade due to hemopericardium \nF. Type B dissections involve only the descending aorta and are \nassociated with a monality rate of about 15%. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosis of aortic dissection is notoriously difficult. There \nare no signs or symptoms that are consistently associated with \nvery high or very loLRs. \nB. A study of 464 patients with aortic dissection helps describe \nthe common presenting signs and symptoms of people with \nthis diagnosis. \n1. Demographics: \na. Mean age ~ 63 years \nb. Hypenension in about 75% \n2. Presenting signs and symptoms were notable for the \ninfrequency of some classic findings. \na. Pulse deficit was noted in only 15% of patients, syncope \nin 9%, cerebrovascular accident in 5%, and HF in 7%. \nb. Some of the more common symptoms are shown in \nTable 9-10. \n3. Chest radiograph and ECG were found to be very \ninsensitive diagnostic tools. \nTable9-10.

Another study stratified patients by 3 independent \npredictors of aortic dissection: aonic type pain (pain \nof acute onset or tearing or ripping character), aortic or \nmediastinal widening on chest radiograph, and pulse \nor BP differentials. \n1. Low-risk patients had none of the characteristics. \na. Only 7% of these patients had a dissection \nb. Test characteristics of these findings for excluding \ndissection were sensitivity, 96%; speciflcicy, 48%; \nLR+, 1.85; LR-, 0.08. \n2. Intermediate-risk patients had only aortic pain or a \nmediastinal widening; between 30% and 40% of these \npatients had a dissection. \n3. High-risk patients had differential pulses or \nboth aortic pain and a widened mediastinum on \nchest film. \na. > 84% of these patients had a dissection. \nb. Test characteristics of these findings for predicting \ndissection were sensitivity, 76%; speciflcity, 91 %; \nLR+, 8.4; LR-, 0.26. \nD. Summarizing the clinical diagnosis of aortic dissection \n1. Patients with dissections are likdy to have a history of \nhypertension and experience severe, acute pain. \n2. Patients with chest pain are unlikely to have a dissection \nif they do not have any of the following: \na. Acute or tearing or ripping pain \nb. Aortic or mediastinal widening \nc. Asymmetric pulse or BPs \n3. A recent study of patients in whom dissection was \nsuspected included D-dimer measurements and showed \nthat the combination of a loD-dimer (< 500 mg/dL) \nand loclinical risk essentially ruled out dissection. Lo\nclinical risk was defined as \na. No high-risk conditions, such as Marfan syndrome, \nfamily history of aortic disease, or previous aonic \nmanipulation \nb. No aortic type pain \nc. No examination findings consistent with dissection, \nsuch as asymmetric blood pressure, neurologic deficit, \nor hypotension \nE. The gold standard for diagnosis is angiography but most \npatients undergo noninvasive tests (CT or transesophageal \nechocardiography). \n1. Both noninvasive tests have sensitivities and speciflcities \nabove95%. \n2. Angiography is recommended to help guide therapy if there \nis evidence of organ ischemia. \n3. Patients at the highest risk for dissection after clinical \nassessment will have angiography done in the operating \nroom without other diagnostic tests. \nCHEST PAIN I 165 \nTreatment \nA. Because dissection is associated with extremely high monality, \nthe goal is to identify and repair the aneurysm prior to rupture. \nB. Thoracic aortic dissection \n1. Dissection of the thoracic aorta is a medical emergency. \n2. Type A dissections generally are operated on immediately. \n3. Type B dissections usually are managed medically. \n4. Thoracic aortic aneurysms (without dissection) \na. When aneurysms are detected prior to rupture, the goal \nof therapy is to slotheir growth and operate when the \naneurysm reaches a certain size. \nb. Patients with aneurysms should have tight BP control. \nc. Patients should be closely monitored for increasing \naneurysm size. \ncl. Indications for surgery are based on the size of the \naneurysm. \n(I) 5.5 cm for ascending aneurysms \n(2) 6.5 cm for descending aneurysms \n(3) Rapid growth \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. G's Initial troponln was elevated at 3.5 ng/mL with a \nCK of 750 unlt s/L and posit ive MB fraction. The final dJag-\nnosis is nSTEMI. Following t reatment in the emergency \ndepartment with aspirin, clopidogrel, oxygen, beta-blockers, \nnitrates, and enoxaparin, she was taken directly to the car-\ndiac catheterlzatlon laboratory. There she was found to \nhave a left dominant system and an acute thrombosis of \na branch of the left circumflex artery. This was opened with \nintracoronary thrombolysis and a stent was placed. \nThe patient's troponin and CK make the diagnosis of an acute Ml. \nIt should be realized that the presence of an MI does not rule out \ndissection of the thoracic aorta. Between 3% and 5% of patients \nwith dissections have associated Mis. Even before the cathcteri-\nzation results, the subacute onset of the pain, the normal chest \nfilm, the lack of \"tearing pain,\" and symmetric pulses made aonic \ndissection unlikely. \nFour days after her Ml, Mrs. G was discharged with pre-\nscriptions for the following medications: \n1. Atorvastat in, 80 mg \n2. Llslnoprll, 20 mg \n3. Metoprolol. 100 mg \n4. Aspirin, 81 mg \n5. Clopldogrel, 75 mg \n\n166 I CHAPTER 9 \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. H is a 31 -year-old man, previously in excellent health, \nwho arrives at the emergency department complaining of \nchest pain. He reports that the pain began 10 days earlier. \nIt was lnltlally m!ld but has become more severe. The pain ls \naccompanied by mlld cough and shortness of breath. Five \ndays earlier, he came to the emergency department and \nwas diagnosed with costochondrltls; he was given an NSAID \nand discharged. \nSince then the pain has become more severe and has \nbecome pleuritic. He says It is located over the right lateral \nlower chest wall. He reports associated mild dyspnea and \nlow-grade fevers with temperatures as high as 38\"C. \n~ \nAt thle point, what le the leading hypotheele, \n1~Jll\"' what are the active alternatives, and Is \nthere a muet not mf99 diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential dlagnoeie, what tests should be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThis is a healthy young man with a subacute illness. He reports \npleuritic chest pain, cough, dyspnea, and fevers. Because his pain \nis subacute we refer back to Figure 9-1. The first important point \nis to consider whether his presentation is consistent with stable \nangina. Given his demogtaphics and presentation, CAD would be \na very unlikely cause for his symptoms. \nGiven this patient's loCAD risk, we next consider common \ncauses of chest pain, such as musculoskeletal or esophageal causes. \nThis is likely the diagnostic pathway followed by Mr. H's physician \n5 days ago when costochondritis was diagnosed. However, today \nthe presentation also includes a fever and dyspnea, symptoms not \nassociated with musculoskeletal chest wall syndromes or GERD. \nAt this point it is important to consider causes of chest pain \nassociated with fever. Infectious diseases that could cause pleuritic \nchest pain, shortness of breath, and fever will certainly lead this \nlist. Pneumonia or pleural effusion could cause these symptoms, \neither individually or as part of the same process. (Pleural effu-\nsions will be discussed belowhile pneumonia will be discussed \nin Chapter 10.) Pericarditis can also cause pleuritic chest pain and \ncan be associated with fevers. When severe, the pleurisy of pericar-\nditis may be experienced as dyspnea by the patient. PE is a classic \ncause of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath and may be \nassociated with low-grade fever (see Chapter 15). Intra-abdominal \nprocesses, such as subdiaphragmatic abscess should also be kept in \nmind as causes of pleuritlc chest pain. The combination of fever, \ndyspnea, and chest pain places pneumonia or pleural effusion at \nthe top of the list. Table 9-11 lists the differential diagnosis. \nDuring further history taking, Mr. H reports no radiation \nof the pain. He denies abdomlnal pain, nausea, vomiting. or \nchange In appetite. Deep breathing and sudden movements \nworsen the pain. There are no other palliative or provocative \nfeatures. \nOn physical exam, Mr. H Isa healthy appearing man who Is \nin mild distress. He moves gingerly because of the pain and \nhe is dyspneic. He coughs occasionally during the history. \nThis causes great pain. Vital signs are temperature, 38.9\"C; \nBP. 130/84 mm Hg; pulse. 110 bpm; RR. 26 breaths per \nminute. Head and neck exam Is normal; there Is no jugular \nvenous distentlon. Lung exam is notable for dullness to per-\ncussion and decreased breath sounds at the right base. \nThere is an area of ego phony j ust superior to thr:: decreased \nbreath sounds and normal breath sounds superior to this. \nThe left chest is clear. Heart exam Is normal as are t he \nabdomen and extremities. A 12-lead ECG reveals sinus \ntachycardia without PR depression or lschemlc changes. \n~~ le the cllnlcal Information 9ufflclent to make a \n1~\"f\" diagnosis? If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Pleural Effusion \nTeubook Presentation \nSmall effusions are usually asymptomatic while large effusions \nrdiably cause dyspnea with or without pleuritlc chest pain. The \npresentation depends on the cause of the effusion. Parapneumonic \neffusions are accompanied by the signs and symptoms of pneumo-\nnia while effusions related to neoplasm, HF, PE or rheumatologic \ndisease are accompanied by signs of those underlying diseases. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Pathophysiology of pleural effusions vary by etiology but may \nbe due to one or any combination of the following disruptions \nin capillary Starling forces: \nTable 9-11.

Increased negative intrapleural (hydrostatic) pressure \n6. Disruption of pulmonary lymphatics \nB. The most common causes of pleural effusions with their \napproximate yearly incidence are listed in Table 9-12. \nC. A useful way of organizing the differential diagnosis is by \nwhether the effusion is exudative or transudativc. \n1. Exudative effusions are caused by increased capillary \npermeability or disruption of pulmonary lymphatics. \n2. Transudative effusions are caused by increased hydrostatic \npressure, decreased oncotic pressure, or increased negative \nintrapleural pressure. \n3. Table 9-13 lists common transudativc and exudative \neffusions. \nD. Exudative effusions commonly complicate the following \ndiagnoses: \nTable 9-12.

Pneumonia \na. Any effusion associated with pneumonia, lung abscess, \nor bronchiectasis is considered a parapneumonic \neffusion. \nb. Empyemas are parapneumonic effusions that have \nbecome infected. \nc. Empyemas, and certain parapneumonic effusions called \ncomplicated parapneumonic effusions, are more likely \nto form fibrotic, pleural peels. The diagnostic criteria for \nthese types of effusions are described in the Evidence-\nBased Diagnosis section. \nd. Parapneumonic effusions accompany 40% of all \npneumonias, while empyemas are rare complications. \ne. Effusions are more likely to form and are more likely \nto become infected if the treatment of the underlying \npneumonia is ddayed. \n The bacteriology of parapneumonic effusions is shown \nin Table 9-14. \n2. Malignancy \na. Cancers most commonly associated with effusions are \n(1) Lung \n(2) Breast \n(3) Lymphoma \n(4) Leukemia \n(5) Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary \nb. The effusion may occur as the presenting symptom \nof the cancer or occur in patients with a previously \ndiagnosed malignancy. \nc. The presence of a malignant effusion is generally a very \npoor prognostic sign. \n3. PE \na. Effusions are present in 26-56% of patients with PE. \nb. Most commonly, effusions accompany PE in patients \nwith pleuritic pain or hemoptysis. \n4. Viral infections \na. Considered to be a common cause of effusions \nb. Historically, these have been difficult to diagnose but \nwith the widespread availability of respiratory viral panel \ntesting this may change. \nc. Usually diagnosed in patients with febrile or nonfebrile \nillness with a transient effusion and negative evaluation \nfor other causes. \nd. Other clues such as atypical lymphocytes, monocytosis, \nand leukopenia are helpful in diagnosing viral infection. \nTable 9-14.

CABG \nA pleural effusion should only be diagnosed as \nviral in an appropriate clinical setting when more \nserious causes of effusion have been ruled out. \na. Pleural effusions develop in up to 90% of patients \nimmediately following CABG. \nb. Can be left sided or bilateral \nc. Usually resolve spontaneously \n6. Other diseases that are not common causes of exudative \npleural effusions include \na. Uremia \nb. Tuberculosis (TB) \nc. Chylothorax \nd. Rheumatologic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis and \nsyi;temic lupus erythematosus) \nE. Transudative effusions are commonly associated with \n1. HF \na. Effusions are accompanied by other findings of left HF. \nb. Effusions are usually bilateral; unilateral effusions can \noccur, but they are less common. \n2. Cirrhosis with ascites \na. About 6% of patients with ascites have pleural effusions. \nb. Effusion is thought to be secondary to ascites moving \ninto the thorax via defects in the diaphragm. \nc. It is extremely rare to have pleural effusions on the basis \nof cirrhosis without ascites. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Detecting a pleural effusion \n1. The test characteristics for dullness to chest percussion are \nnot well defined. The best estimates are sensitivity, 77%; \nspecificity, 92%; LR+, 7.7; LR-, 0.27. \n2. There is often an area of egophony just superior to the \neffusion. \n3. Once detected, a pleural effusion is confirmed on chest \nradiograph, ultrasound, or other form of chest imaging. \nB. Determining the etiology of a pleural effusion \n1. Any clinically significant effusion (> 1 cm on a chest film) \nshould be sampled via thoracentesis; the only exception is \nin the case of HF. \na. If the clinical suspicion for HF as the sole cause of the \neffusion is high, the effusion can be observed while the \npatient is treated. \nb. If the effusion persists or the diagnosis becomes \nuncertain, the effusion should then be sampled. \n~ \nPleural effusions are abnormal; any nepleural \ny \neffusion should be evaluated. \n2. The first step in determining the cause of an effusion is to \ndifferentiate transudative from exudative effusions. \na. The Light criteria are the most widely used test fur \ndifferentiating transudative from e:x:udative effusions. By \nthese criteria, an effusion is considered to be an exudate \nif any of the following are present: \n(1) Pleural fluid protein/serum protein> 0.5 \n(2) Pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LD)/serum \nLD > 0.6 \n(3) Pleural fluid LD > two-thirds upper limit of normal \nfor serum LD \nb. The test characteristics for Light criteria are \n(1) Sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 83% \n(2) LR+, 5.76; LR-, 0.02 \nc. The most specific test for an exudative effusion is a \ndifference between the serum albumin and pleural fluid \nalbumin of< 1.2 g/dL (LR+ 10.88). \n3. Once the diagnosis of a transudate or exudate is made, \nvarious other tests hdp determine the exact diagnosis. \na. Positive Gram stain or culture makes the diagnosis of an \nempyema. \nb. Fluid pH: A lopH(< 7.2) is commonly seen with \n(1) Empyemas \n(2) Malignant effusions \n(3) Esophageal rupture \nc. Cdl count \n(1) Neutrophil count over 50% argues for an acute \nprocess \n(a) Parapneumonic effusion (sensitivity = 91 % ) \n(b) PE \n(2) A high neutrophil count is rarely seen in subacute \ndiseases such as TB and malignancy. \n(3) Lymphocyte predominant exudative effusions \nare almost always caused by TB or malignancy \n{positive predictive value= 97%). \n(4) Pleural fluid eosinophilia is a nonspecific finding. \nIt is seen frequently with inflammatory diseases, \npneumococcal pneumonia, viral pleuritis, TB, and \neven repeated thoracentesis. \n(5) A lomesothelial cell count(< 5%) is highly \nsuggestive ofTB. \nd. Cytology \n(1) Highly specific for the diagnosis of cancer \n(2) Sensitivity is 70% at best, with significantly lower \nvalues for some cancers. \n4. Other tests for certain diseases are done if the clinical \nsuspicion is high. \na. Tuberculous effusions \n(1) Usually suspected based on clinical presentation and \npleural fluid lymphocytosis \n(2) The sensitivity of commonly used tests for the \ndiagnosis of mberculous pleurisy are \n(a) Pleural fluid culture, 42% \n(b) Pleural biopsy culture, 64% \n(c) Pleural biopsy histology (caseating granulomas), \n70-80% \n(d) Histology and pleural tissue culture > 90% \n(e) Sputum culture, 20-50% \n(3) Two newer tests, pleural fluid adenosine deaminase \nand interferon~gamma, are proving useful in \nthe diagnosis of tuberculous effusions. Test \ncharacteristics from recent meta-analyses are \n(a) Adenosine deaminase: sensitivity and specificity \nof92.2%; LR+, 11.82; LR-, 0.08 \n\n(b) Interferon-gamma: sensitivity, 89%; specificity, \n97%; LR+, 23.45; LR-, 0.11 \nb. Glucose levels< 60 mg/dL are seen in \n(1) Empyema \n(2) TB \n(3) Rhewnatoid arthritis \n(4) Systemic lupus erythemarosus \nc. Triglycerides are> 110 mg/dL in patients with \nchylothorax. The fluid is also a milky white. \ncl Thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy is necessary when \nthere is a suspicion for malignancy and cytology is \nnegative. \nTreatment \nPleural fluid testing should always include LD, \nprotein, albwnin, pH, and cell count. Other \ntests, such as cytology, are often sent. \nA. Pleural effusions are managed by treating the underlying \ndisease (eg, pneumonia, uremia, HF). \nB. Specific treatment of the effusion is necessary in certain \ncircumstances. \n1. Complicated parapnewnonic effusions \na. Evacuation by chest tube drainage prevents pleural \nscarring and the development of restrictive pleural \ndisease. \nb. Indications for chest tube placement are \n(1) Purulent fluid or positive Gram stain \n(2) pH< 7.2 \n(3) LD > 1000 units/L \n(4) Glucose< 40 mgldL \n(5) Small effusions that are close to the above 3 cutoffi \ncan sometimes be carefully monitored. \n2. Malignant pleural effusions \na. Usually managed by treating the underlying disease and \nperiodic therapeutic thoracentesis. \nb. If thoracentesis is required frequently and the patient's \nlife expectancy is long, there are a number of options \namong which are \n(1) Pleurodesis, obliteration of the pleural space by the \ninstallation of a chemical irritant \n(2) Catheter drainage, in which a semi-permanent \ncatheter is placed to alloconstant drainage of the \neffusion. \n3. Chylothorax \na. Caused by nontraumatic (primarily lymphoma) or \ntrawnatic (usually surgical) disruption of the thoracic \nduct. \nb. In nontraumatic cases, the underlying disease is treated. \nc. In both nontraumatic and traumatic disease, the pleural \nspace is evacuated with chest robe drainage. \nd. A diet of mediwn chain fatty acids or a trial of total \nparenteral nutrition is used to decrease flothrough the \nthoracic duct. \ne. Pleurodesis and surgical management reserved for \nrefractory cases. \nCHEST PAIN I 169 \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nThe patient's physical exam findings are consistent with a \npleural effusion. A posteroanterlor, lateral, and decubitus \nchest film were done that revealed an effusion. The effu-\nsion was aspirated and yielded pale, turbid fluid. The Ini-\ntial results are glucose,< 20 mg/dL; LD, 38,400 unlts/L; \nprotein, 4.4 g/dl; fluid pH. 6.2; RBC, 3200/mcl; WBC, \n144,000/mcl; Gram stain positivr:: for gram-positive cocci \nin pairs and chains. Serum values at the time included total \nprotein of 7.8 g/dL and LD of 141 unlts/L. Blood cultures. \nsputum cultures, and urine strop antigen testing were also \nordered. \nHave you c:rosead a dlagn09tlc; threshold for \nthe leading hypothesis, pleural affuslon1 Have \nyou ruled out the active alternative&? Do \nother ta&t& need to bs done to eJCClude the \naltamatfve diagnoses? \nMr. H has a pleural effusion. Given the sire of the effusion on the \nchest film, a thoracentesis was clearly indicated. The results of the \naspirate are diagnostic. The fluid is an exudate and the loglucose, \nlopH, high WBC, and positive Gram stain make the diagnosis \nof an empyema. \nIt is worth noting that Mr. H's previous diagnosis of muscu-\nloskeletal chest pain was incorrect. A chest radiograph done on his \nprevious visit to the emergency department may have made the \ncorrect diagnosis and treatment could, potentially, have prevented \nthe development of an empyema. Chest films can be instrumen-\ntal in identifying soft tissue, skeletal, pulmonary, and mediastinal \ncauses of chest pain. In fact, over 20% of chest radiographs reveal \nfindings that change or determine the course of treatment for \npatients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain. \n~ \nA chest film should be performed in any \ny \npatient with chest pain and no clear diagnosis. \nAlternative Diagnoses: Acute Pericarditis \nTextbook Presentation \nAcute pericarditis typically presents in young adults, with 1 week of \nviral symptoms and chest pain that improves with leaning forward. \nPhysical exam reveals a 3-part friction rub. ECG reveals ST eleva-\ntions and PR depressions in all leads. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Differential diagnosis \n1. Viral pericarditis is primarily caused by coxsackievirus, \nechovirus, and adenovirus. \n2. Other infectious causes of pericarditis include TB \n(historically the most common) and HIY. \n3. Pericarditis may occur after myocardial injury (post MI and \npostcardiac surgery). \n4. Rheumatologic causes include systemic lupus \nerythematosus and rhewnatoid arthritis. \n5. Procainamide and hydralazine are among the drugs that \ncan cause pericarditis. \n\n170 I CHAPTER 9 \n6. Malignancy that has metastasized to the pericardium \n7. Chest irradiation \n8. Uremia \nB. Although the differential diagnosis of pericarditis is long. \n85-90% of cases are considered idiopathic or due to an \nundiagnosed virus. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Pericarditis is diagnosed when the characteristic pericardia! \nfriction is heard or when a patient with chest pain has \ncharacteristic ECG findings. \nB. History \nI. Chest pain is almost always present. \n2. The pain is usually pleuritic. \n3. It classically radiates to the trapezius ridge. \n4. Pain improves with sitting and worsens with reclining. \nC. Physical exam \n~ \n1. The pericardia! friction rub is insensitive but nearly 100% \nspecific; it is diagnostic of pericarditis. \n2. The rub is usually triphasic. \na. Triphasic in 58% of cases \nb. Biphasic in 24% of cases \nc. Monophasic in 18% of cases \n3. Pericarditis is usually complicated by a pericardia! effusion. \nAlthough the physical exam is insensitive for pericardia! \neffusions, it is good for detecting tamponade. \na. Sensitivity of jugular venous distention to detect \ntamponade is 100%. \nb. Sensitivity of tachycardia to detect tamponade is 100%. \nc. Pulsus paradox:us > 12 mm Hg \n(1) Sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 83% \n(2) LR+, 5.9; LR-, 0.03 \nd. Beck triad (hypotension, jugular venous distention, and \nthe presence of muffied heart sounds) is seldom seen but \nis very specific for tamponade. \n4. ECG \na. The ECG most commonly shows widespread ST \nelevations and PR depressions. This finding is highly \nspecific, but the sensitivity is only about 60%. \nb. The differentiation of pericarditis from acute MI on \nECG can be difficult. Some of the key differentiating \nfactors are \n(1) ST elevation in pericarditis is usually diffuse while \nin MI it is localized to leads associated with the area \nof ischemia/infarction. \n(2) ST elevations in MI are often associated with \nreciprocal changes. \n(3) PR depression is very uncommon in acute Ml. \n(4) Q waves are not present with pericarditis. \nPericarditis can mimic Ml. The presence of a \nrub and careful analysis of the ECG should \nenable their distinction. \n5. Other diagnostic tests \na. An echocardiogram is always done when pericarditis \nhas been diagnosed to evaluate the presence of a \nsignificant pericardia! effusion and exclude the presence \nof tamponade. \nb. Cardiac enzymes are frequently positive and are \ntherefore not helpful for distinguishing the chest pain of \npericarditis from that of cardiac ischemia. \nD. Determining the etiology of pericarditis \n1. Because most pericarditis is either idiopathic or viral, \nrequiring only supportive care, extensive work-up is \ngenerally not indicated. \n2. After a thorough history, most experts recommend only a \nfediagnostic tests. \na. Chest radiograph \nb. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine \nc. Test for TB (purified protein derivative or interferon-\ngamma release assays [Quantiferon]) \nd. Antinuclear antibodies \ne. Blood cultures \n3. More extensive evaluation is appropriate for patients with \nrefractory or recurrent disease. Even the most invasive \ndiagnostic studies, pericardiocentesis and pericardia! biopsy, \nare generally not helpful. Their diagnostic yield is only \nabout 20%. \nTreatment \nA. Because most patients have viral or idiopathic disease, the \ntreatment of acute pericarditis is supportive. \n1. NSAIDs are the treatment of choice, usually providing \ngood pain relief. \n2. The addition of colchicine may improve response to \ntherapy and decrease rates of recurrent disease. \nB.

Pericardiocentesis is required in patients with tamponade. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. H underwent chest tube drainage of the effusion. \nBecause the effusion was Joculated, 3 tubes were \nplaced under thoracoscopic guidance. He was given a \nthird-generat ion cephalosporin while sensit ivities of his \npresumed pneumococcus were pending. He became afelmle \nafter 2 days of ant ibiotics and chest tu be drainage. The tu be \noutput declined over 5 days and the tu bes were removed on \nday 6. Total output was about 3 L. He was discharged with \na prescription for 6 weeks of oral antibiotics. \nEmpyemas are a medical emergency. They are closed space infec-\ntions that need to be drained in order to cure them and preserve \nfuture lung function. & soon as one is detected, steps should he \ntaken to drain it. \n\nREFERENCES \nAbrams J.

Howould you frame \nthe differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe differential diagnosis of acute cough and congestion ranges \nfrom trivial self-limited upper respiratory viral infections to seri-\nous, imminently life-threatening pneumonia. Importantly, there \nare many causes of pneumonia that need to be identified in order \nto make an accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. \nDifferential Diagnosis of Acute Cough \nand Congestion \nA. Common cold \nB. Sinusitis \nC. Bronchitis \nD. Influenza \nE. Pertussis \nF. Pneumonia \n1. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) \n2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia \n3. Aspiration pneumonia \n4. Tuberculosis (TB) \n5. Opportunistic (eg. Pneumocystis jirovn:ii pneumonia [PJP]) \nThe approach to such patients focuses on 2 pivotal questions. First, \ndoes the patient have symptoms, signs, or risk factors for pneumo-\nnia that warrant a chest radiograph or other evaluation? Second, \nin patients with pneumonia, is it a CAP vs. another type of pneu-\nmonia (such as PJP, aspiration pneumonia, TB, etc.) that requires \nadditional diagnostic evaluation and/or treatment? \nPATIENT \nMs. L reports that she was in her usual state of health until \n5 days ago when a cough developed. There was no associ-\nated sore throat, rhinitis, myalglas or headache. Two days \nago. a low-grade fever (37.8C) developed. which increased \nlas't night to 38.8C. She reports tha't her spu'tum Is yello\nand that she has no chest pain or shortness of brea'th. \n~ \n~ \nHoreliable le the hietory and phyelcal mcam \n~r for detecting pneumonia? \nA. The diagnosis of pneumonia is usually based on clinical find-\nings {cough, fever, crackles), accompanied by infiltrate on \nchest film. Microbiologic confirmation is usually unnecessary. \nB. When evaluating a patient who has acute respiratory symptoms \nit is imperative to determine who is likely to have pneumonia \nand therefore needs a radiograph to c:va.luate their symptoms. \nC. Prc:va.lence of symptoms in patients with pneumonia \n1. Cough, 96% \n2. Fever, 81 % but 53% in the ddcrly \nElderly patients with pneumonia often do not \nhave a fever. Clinicians should have a lo\nthreshold for obtaining a chest radiograph in \nelderly patients with a cough. \n3. Dyspnea, 46--66% \n4. Pleuritic chest pain, 37-50% \n5. Chills, 59% \n6. Headache, 58% \nD. Physical exam \n1. No single finding is very sensitive. Therefore, the absence of \nany single finding docs not rule out pneumonia (Table 10-1). \na. Neither a normal lung exam nor the absence offever \nrule out pneumonia {LR-, 0.6 and 0.8, respectively). \n\\> A nonrud lung\"\"\" Jo.. not rule out pneumonia \nb. Normal vital signs make pneumonia less likely \n{LR-, 0.18). \nc. The combination of normal vital signs anti normal chest \nexam make pneumonia highly unlikely (sensitivity, \n95%; LR-, 0.09). \n~ \nNormal vital signs anti a normal lung exam \nV\"\" make pneumonia unlikely. \n\n174 I CHAPTER 10 \nTable 10-1. Likelihood ratios for physical findings \nin pneumonia. \nFinding \nFever> 37.8\"C \nAny abnormal vital signs (HR > 100 bpm, \ntemperature> 37.8-C, RR ;i: 30 breaths \nper minute) \nAny chest flndlng \nAbnormal vital signs or abnormal lung exam \nEgophony \nCrackles \nLR+ \n4.4 \n1.2 \n1.3-3.0 \n2.2 \n8.6 \n2.7 \nLR-\n0.8 \n0.18 \n0.6 \n0.091 \n1.0 \n0.9 \n'The negative likelihood ratios (LRs) refer to the likelihood of pneumonia if both the vital \nsigns and lung exam are normal. \nHR, heart rate; RR, respiratory rate. \n2. Egophony is fairly specific and significantly increases the \nlikelihood of pneumonia when present (LR+, 8.6). \nIn summary, there are signs and symptoms that suggest pneumo-\nnia because they are unusual in upper respiratory tract infections or \nbronchitis. These include dyspnea, high fever (with the exception \nof influenza [see bdow]}, altered mental status, hypoxia, hypoten-\nsion, and abnormal findings on chest examination (dullness to \npercussion, crackles, decreased breath sounds, bronchophony, or \negophony}. Any patient with such symptoms or signs requires \na chest radiograph to rule out pneumonia. A chest radiograph \nshould also be strongly considered in patients at increased risk for \npoor outcomes, including immunocompromised patients, elderly \npatients, patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD} (in whom abnor-\nmal lung findings are also more difficult to appreciate}. On the \nother hand, patients with normal vital signs, a normal lung exam \nand who are not at risk for poor outcomes do not normally need a \nchest radiograph. Figure 10-1 shows a diagnostic algorithm illus-\ntrating the initial approach to patients with cough and congestion. \nIn patients discovered to have pneumonia, the next pivotal step \nis to determine the likely etiologic pathogen(s} to ensure patients \nreceive appropriate therapy. While most patients seen in the com-\nmunity with pneumonia have community-acquired pneumonia \n(due to Streptococcus pnnunoniae, Mycuplasma pneumoniae, Legione!Ja. \nand others}, it is important to realize that many patients from the \ncommunity have other types of pneumonia {ie, aspiration pneumo-\nnia, influenza pneumonia, TB pneumonia, etc.} caused by other \npathogens that require different/additional antimicrobial therapy. \nA careful revieof both the patient's risk factors and chest radio-\ngraph often provide critical clues that suggest additional microor-\nganisrns needing evaluation and antibiotic coverage (Figure 10-2). \nPneumonia in patients with known irnmunocompromise will \nnot be covered in this chapter (known HIY, transplant recipients, \nand patients with granulocytopenia}. \n\nOn physical exam, Ms.Lis in no acute distress.

Pharynx Is unremarkable; \nlung exam reveals normal breath sounds without crackles, \ndullness, bronchophony, or egophony. \nAt this point, what is the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altema-t;ives, and is \ntheNJ a must not mlH dlagno11!117 Given thle \ndlfferentlal dlag nosis, what tests should be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAs noted above, the initial differential diagnosis of acute cough \nand fever includes acute bronchitis, influenza, and pneumonia. \nLike many real-life patients, this patient's clinical picture is not \ntypical for any of these conditions. Acute bronchitis may cause \na cough and low-grade fever but 38.8C is unusual. Pneumonia \ncould clearly cause a cough and fever but is often associated with \nan abnormal lung exam. Influenza often causes cough and fever, \n{and a normal lung exam) but the subacute onset of fever and lack \nof other upper respiratory symptoms is unusual. It is also early in \nthe season for influenza. Nonetheless, you decide that influenza is \nthe leading hypothesis with acute bronchitis and pneumonia being \nactive alternatives. Given the clinical uncenainty, a chest film and \nnasopharyngeal swab for influenza are ordered. Table 10-2 lists the \ndifferential diagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: Influenza \nTextbook Presentation \nAlthough there is a wide range of severity of influenza symptoms, \npatients typically complain of a severe, febrile, respiratory illness \nthat begins abruptly. The onset is often abrupt (\"like being hit by a \ntrain\"), associated with severe myalgias (even their eyes hurt when \nthey look around), diffuse pain (they may complain that their hair \nor skin hurts}, respiratory symptoms (cough, rhinitis, pharyngi-\ntis), and high fever (occasionally as high as 40-41C) that peaks \nwithin 12 hours. Patients may have rigors (frankly shaking chills) \nand headache (Figure 10-3). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Pathogenesis \n1. Antigenic change in the virus surface glycoprotein \n(hemagglutinin or neuraminidase} renders populations \nsusceptible to the virus. Antigenic shifu are most common \nwith influenza virus A and are associated with epidemics. \n2. Influenza infects respiratory epithdium. \n3. Adults are infectious from the day prior to the onset of \nsymptoms until about 5-7 days later (10 days in children}. \n4. The incubation period is 1-4 days. \nB. Epidemiology \n1. Results in 55,000-431,000 hospitalizations per year in the \nUnited States and 17,000-51,000 deaths \n2. Influenza typically occurs during the winter months \n(between December and March in the Northern Hemisphere \nversus April and September in the Southern Hemisphere}. \n3. Influenza occurs throughout the year in the tropics. \n~ \nInfluenza is an unlikely diagnosis in the late \ny \nspring, summer, or early fall. \n4.

See text. \n4A normal chest film does not completely rule out pneumonia. Patients in whom there is a high clinical suspicion (eg, those with \nfocal crackles and fever), should be empirically treated for pneumonia with consideration for additional radiographic imaging {eg, \nfollow-up chest film or CT scan. See text.) \nCOPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \nFigure 10-1. Initial approach to patients with cough and congestion. \n5.

Influenza pneumonia \n(I) Influenza may cause pneumonia but is oftm \nassociated with bacterial coinfection. \n(a) Bacterial coinfection is present in at least 18-34% \nof cases managed in the ICU and up to 55% of \nfatal cases. \n(b) Common pathogens include S pneumoniae, \nStaphywcoccus aureus (commonly methicillin-\nresistant S aureus), and group A streptococci. \n(c) Clinical features do not distinguish patients \nwith or without coinfection. \n(d) Although bacterial infection has often been taught \nto occur after influem.a, it often develops during \nperiods of high viral shedding, and develops \nconcurrmt with or sho\"\"' after influenu infection. \n(e) Additionally, symptoms and radiographs \nare similar between patients with influenza \npneumonia with or without coinfection. \nWhile some radiographic findings can suggest \nnecrotizing pneumonia due to S aureus \n{cavitary disease, pleural effusions), they are not \nsufficiently sensitive to rule it out. Chest film \nshows bilateral or lobar pulmonary infiltrates. \nTable 10-3.

The history, physical exam, and vaccination status affect the \nlikelihood of disease. The summary of findings and likelihood \nratios are presented in Table 10-4. \n1. The negative LRs are modest, suggesting it is difficult to \nrule out influenza clinically. \na. The absence of fever and cough hdps decrease the \nlikdihood of flu but does not rule it out (LR-, 0.4--0.42). \nThey are even less useful in ruling it out in patients aged \n60 years or older (LR-, 0.72, 0.57). \nInfluem:a should be considered in febrile elderly \npatients during influenza season, even in those \nwithout cough. \nb. An emergency department study confirmed the poor \nsensitivity of a clinical diagnosis of influenza (sensitivity, \n36%; specificity, 78%; LR+, 1.6; LR-, 0.82) \nc. Another emergency department study documented \nthat < 50% of patients with influenza of< 48 hours \nand a CDC indication fur influenza treatment received \nantiviral therapy. \nd. The CDC definition of an \"influenza-like illness\" \n(temperature> 37.8C with either cough or sore throat) \nis also insensitive (sensitivity, 31%; specificity, 88%; \nLR+, 2.6; LR-, 0.78). \n2. Fev\" with cough, particularly in older patients, increases \nthe likdihood of influenza (LR+, 5.0). \nFever> 37.8C with cough should suggest influ-\nenza (as well as various types of pneumonia), \nparticularly in patients ~ 60 years old. \nTable 1D-4.

Fever ~ 37 .8C with at least 2 of the following: headache, \nmyalgia, cough, or sore throat and symptom onset \nwithin 48 hours. \nb. In addition, the rule requires at least 2 cases of confirmed \ninfluenza in the community (LR+, 6.5). \nB. Laboratory results \n1. During influenza outbreaks, empiric therapy (see below) \nwithout laboratory confirmation is appropriate in patients \nwith typical symptoms, clear lung fields, and no history of \nvaccination who present within 48 hours of symptom onset. \n2. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) \nrecommends testing in patients in whom it will \ninfluence management, especially immunocompromised \npatients, immunocompetent patients at risk for severe \nillness, hospitalized patients with pneumonia during \ninfluenza season, elderly patients with fever of unknown \norigin, health care personnel, residents of or visitors to \ninstitutionalized persons. \n3. Testing is most appropriate in noninfluenza periods and \nmay be particularly useful in identifying outbreaks to \nimplement control measures. \na. Various methods are available including reverse \ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), \nculture, immunofluorescence staining, and rapid \ninfluenza diagnostic tests \n(l) RT-PCR \n(a) The gold standard for the diagnosis of influenza \n(b) Virtually 100% sensitive and specific \n(c) However, sensitivity ofRT-PCR of \nnasopharyngeal samples is only 50% in patients \nwith severe influenza pneumonia. \n(d) Takes 1-8 hours to perform and is done in the \nlaboratory (and not on site in the clinics). \n(2) A large variety of more rapid tests, which include \nrapid influenza diagnostic tests that detect influenza \nantigens, digital immune assays, and nucleic acid \namplification tests (NAAT), have been developed to \ndiagnose influenza and many can be done on site. \n(a) The sensitivity of these tests is suboptimal \n(33-87%) and negative tests do not rule out \ninfluenza (LR-, 0.13-0.67), especially in \npatients with severe disease or in patients in \nwhom influenza is strongly suspected. Empiric \ntherapy or PCR testing is appropriate in some \npatients. \n(b) The specificity is high (97%) and positive \ntests confirm the diagnosis of influenza. (LR+, \n23-100). However, positive test results do not \nrule out concomitant bacterial infection, which \nshould still be considered in patients with \ninfluenza and pneumonia. \n4. Figure 10-4 illustrates the CDC recommendation for \ninfluenza testing. \n5. In hospitalized patients with severe lower tract infection, \nlower respiratory tract specimens (ie, sputum, endotracheal \naspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]) should also be \ncollected and tested with RT-PCR as they may be positive \ndespite negative results from nasopharyngeal swabs. \n6. Patients with pneumonia should have additional testing fur \ncoinfection including a sputum Gram stain, sputum and \nblood cultures, and urine for Smptococcal and Legionetla \nantigen. \n\nCOUGH, FEVER, AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS I 179 \nDoes the patient have signs and symptoms suggestive of influenza, \nIncluding atypical clinical presentation, or findings \nsuggestive of complications associated with influenza? \nI \nYes+ \n+No \nIs the patient being \nInfluenza testing probably \nadmitted to the \nnot Indicated; consider \nhospital? \nother etlologles \nI \nYes+ \n+No \nTest for influenza; start empiric antiviral \nWill Influenza testing \ntreatment for hospitalized patients while \nYes \nresults Influence clnlcal \nNo \nlnfkJenza cllnlcally diagnosed: start empiric \n-\n-\nresults are pending (molecular assays \nmanagement? \nanUvlral treatment H the patient Is In a \nshould be used for influenza testing of \nhlitHl&k group for Influenza compllcatlons, \nhospitalized patients.)

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation for influenza testing. (Reproduced with permission from Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). Guide for considering influenza \ntesting when influenza viruses are circulating in the community. Last reviewed March 4, 2019.) \nTreattnent \nA. Prevention \n1. Vaccination \na. Vaccination results in 50% fewer cases of influenza, \nassociated pneumonia, and hospitalizations. \nb. 68% decrease in all cause mortality \nc. Due to the high rate of influenza virus mutation, the \nvaccine is modifled annually to match the current strains \nof circulating virus. It is administered annually from late \nOctober until the end of influenza season, typically May. \nd. The 2018-2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization \nPractices (ACIP) recommends annual influenza \nvaccination for all persons ~ 6 months who do not \nhave contraindications. \ne. Persons at increased risk for complications from \ninfluenza (see above) should be especially targeted \nfor vaccination. Other targeted populations include \ncaregivers for the aforementioned patients and health \ncare personnel. \n A variety of influenza vaccines are available including \ninactivated virus vaccines, recombinant vaccines, and \nlive-attenuated virus vaccines. Preparations may be \ntrivalent (targeting 3 currently active influenza viruses) \nor quadrivalent (targeting 4 viruses), standard dose or \nhigh dose or adjuvanted. The optimal choice varies \nannually. The ACIP annual recommendations can be \nfound at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/ \nvacc-specific/flu.html. \ng. Live-attenuated intranasal vaccine uses live-attenuated \nstrains administered intranasally that replicate poorly in \nthe warmer lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory \ninfection side effects are common. Compared \nwith placebo, they increase upper nasal congestion \n(45% vs 27%) and sore throat (28% vs 17%). \nAdditionally, persons vaccinated with live-attenuated \nintranasal influenza vaccine can uansmit the attenuated \ninfection to other persons. \nh. Contraindications (for any of the influenza vaccines) \n(1) Any prior alletgic reaction to the influenza vaccine \n(2) History ofGuillain-Barre syndrome following \ninfluenza vaccination. \n(3) Moderate to severe current illness with or without \na fever. \n(4) Egg allergy is not a contraindication to influenza \nvaccination. \n(5) Additional contraindications/precautions exist for the \nlive-attenuated vaccine. Its use should be limited to \npatients S 49 and it should not be given to patients \nwith asthma or any of the high-risk conditions listed \nabove. It should not be administered to persons \nwho are caregivers to patients with either asthma or \nare immunocompromised. Additionally, antiviral \nmedications in the 48 hours prior to vaccination or \nthe week following vaccination may interfere with its \neffectiveness. \n2. Chemoprophylaxis \na. Significantly more costly than vaccination \nb. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are neuraminidase inhibitors \nactive against influenza viruses A and B and are usually \nhighly effective as chemoprophylaxis. \nc. Indications for chemoprophylaxis \n(1) Persons at high risk (or those who come in contact \nwith such persons) who were vaccinated after exposure \nto influenza. Additionally, such patients should receive \nchemoprophylaxis if there was a poor match between \nthe vaccine and circulating virus strain. \n\n180 I CHAPTER 10 \n(2) Persons with immune deficiencies who are unlikely \nto mount a response to vaccination (ie, those with \nadvanced HIV disease, transplant recipients) could \nalso receive prophylaxis. \n(3) Persons with contraindications to vaccination. \n(4) Persons living in institutions during outbreaks \n(ie, nursing homes) regardless of vaccination status. \nB. Treatment of influenza \n1. Zanamivir and oseltamivir \na. When given within 48 hours of symptom onset, to patients \nwith documented influenza, they reduce the symptom \nseverity and the duration of symptoms approximately 1 day. \nOsdtamivir has also been demonstrated to reduce the \nincidence oflower respiratory tract inkctions requiring \nantibiotics (NNT 22), pneumonia (ARR 1.1 % NNT 90) \nand all-cause hospitali7.ations (NNT 91). \nb. A benefit may be present when started within 96 hours \nof symptoms in hospitalized patients. \nc. Safery during pregnancy is unknown. \nd. Studies suggest that empiric therapy is cost effective for \nseveral groups. \ne. Influenza testing (see above) is recommended if prevalence \nof influenza is low. \n2. Oseltamivir \na. Route of administration is oral. Side effects include nausea \n(NNH 27) and vomiting (NNH 21). \nb. Reduce the dose by 50% if creatinine clearance \n<30 mUmin. \nc. Drug resistance \n(1) A strain of influenza A (HlNl) was discovered to \nbe resistant to oseltamivir in the 2008-2009 season \n(99% of isolates). \n(2) The CDC has recommended combining oseltamivir \nwith rirnantadine or using zanamivir alone for this \nstrain or if the influenza strain is unknown. \n(3) Oseltamivir alone is recommended for other strains \nof influenza (influenza B or influenza A, H3N2). \n3. Zanamivir \na. Route of administration is inhalation; can cause \nbronchospasm. Other adverse side effects include \ndiarrhea and nausea. \nb. Not recommended in patients with asthma or COPD. \n4. Peramivir 600 mg IV x 1 dose, is an alternative for patients \nwith uncomplicated influenza with symptoms of less than \n2 days in duration. \nS. Indications for treatment in patients with suspected influenza \na. All hospitalized patients, patients with severe influenza \n(pneumonia), and patients at high risk for complications, \nincluding pregnant patients {see above Complications) \nb. Therapy should be started within 48 hours when \npossible but may still provide a benefit when started \nwithin 5 days of symptom onset in severely sick patients \nand those at risk for complications. \nc. When indicated, treatment should be initiated as soon \nas possible and not delayed while awaiting test results. \nd. Consider for patients without risk factors for \ncomplications who present within 48 hours of symptom \nonset and wish to shorten the duration of illness and \nlower their risk for influenza complications. \nc. In addition to antiviral therapy, patients with influenza \nand pneumonia should receive antibacterial coverage \nthat includes coverage for S pneumoniae and S aureus \n(commonly MRSA). \n\nMs. L's RT-PCR is negative for influenza. \n~ \nle ths clinical informa'l;ion eufficisnt to maks a \n1\\,!1' diagnoele1 If not, what other Information do \nyou nssd1 \nGiven the high sensitivity of the RT~PCR, a negative result essen-\ntially rules out influenza, (even more so given the modest pretest \nprobability of influenza in November). \nInfluenza occurs from December to May in the \nnorthern hemisphere; it is highly unlikely at \nother times. \nYou wonder about acute bronchitis and pneumonia and wait \nfor the results of the chest radiograph. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Acute Bronchitis \nTextbook Presentation \nAcute bronchitis presents in the healthy adult primarily as a cough \nof 1-3 weeks duration. Myalgias and low-grade fevers may be \nseen. This is distinct from an acute exacerbation of COPD (see \nChapter 33, Wheezing and Sttidor). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Etiology \n1. Viruses {including influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory \nsyncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus) \n2. Bacterial \na. Bacteria cause < 10% of cases \nb. Organisms include BordeteDa pertussis, Mycoplasmll, and \nChlamydia. \n3. Noninfectious \na. Asthma \nb. Pollution \nc. Tobacco \nd. Cannabis \nB. Symptoms \n1. Initial phase: Cough and systemic symptoms secondary to \ninfection are seen. \n2. Fever absent or lograde. Consider pneumonia in patients \nwhose fever is high-grade (> 38C) or persistent. \n3. Protracted phase \na. 40-65% of patients without prior pulmonary disease sho\nevidence of reactive airway disease during acute bronchitis. \nb. In 26% of patients, cough persists secondary to \nbronchial hyperresponsiveness and lasts ~ 2-4 weeks. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Sputum may be clear or discolored. Discoloration arises from \nttacheobronchial epithelium cells and WBCs and is not diag-\nnostic ofbacterial infection. \n\n.... --...... Purulmt sputum is not an indication for anti-\ny \nbiotic therapy in patients with acute bronchitis. \nB. Chest film is not routine but should be obtained when pneu-\nmonia is being considered (see Figure 10-1); indications \ninclude any of the following: \n1. Patients at risk for pneumonia: dderly patients and those with \nheart, hmg, kidney disease or who are immunocompromised \n2. Symptoms of dyspnea, high fever, rigors, pleuritic chest \npain, or altered mental status \n3. Abnormal vital signs including high fever (temperamre \n> 38C), tachypnea (RR> 24 breaths per minute), \ntachycardia (HR > 100 bpm) \n4. Focal findings on lung exam or hypoxernia \nC. Testing for influenza can be considered in febrile patients who \npresent during influenza season within 48 hours of symptoms \nonset in whom antiviral therapy is being considered (see above). \nTreatment \nA. Antibiotics \n1. Antibiotics do not provide major clinical benefit and are \nnot recommended for most patients with acute bronchitis. \n2. Influenza treatment shortens the course of illness in patients \nwith influenza treated within 48 hours of symptoms {see \nabove) and can be considered in patients with bronchitis \ndue to this pathogen. \nB. Bronchodilators significantly reduce cough in patients with bron-\nchial hyperreactivity, wheezing, or airfloobstruction at basdine. \nC. Antitussives and expectorants are useful symptomatic measures. \n\nA chest film reveals a left lower-lobe inftltrate, confirming \nthe diagnosis of pneumonia. \n~ \nle the clinical information &ufficient to males a \n1~r diagnoeie of cam m unity-aCC\\uinsd pn1Sumonia7 \nIf not, what oth1Jr Information do you Med7 \nLeading Hypothesis: CAP \nTatbook Presentation \nProductive cough and fever are usually the presenting symptoms \nin patients with pneumonia. Symptoms may worsen over days or \ndevelop abruptly. Pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, chills, \nand rigors may also occur. \nDisease Highlights \nA. CAP typically refers to patients with signs, symptoms, and \nradiographic evidence of pneumonia without known immu-\nnocompromise, and that was not hospital acquired (develop-\ning more than 48 hours after admission). \nB. Most common cause of infectious death and hospitalization in \nthe United States \nC. Epidemiology \n1. Epidemiology varies with location, time period and \ndiagnostic tool utilized. The local epidemiology and time \nperiod are important considerations (ie, influenza season). \nCOUGH, FEVER, AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS I 181 \n2. S pneumoniae is usually the most common pathogen . \nOther bacterial pathogens include M pneumoniae, S aureus, \nLegione//a, and others \n3. Viral infection is common. A meta-analysis revealed a viral \npathogen in 44.2% of patients (in studies that sampled \nlower respiratory tract with BAL and sputum). Common \nviruses include human rhinovirus, influenza A and B, \nhuman metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, \nparainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and others. \n4. Viral-bacterial coinfection is surprisingly common in \npatients with CAP. \na. Concomitant viral and bacterial infections occurred \nin 19-39% of all patients, 44% of patients with \nS pneumoniae. \nb. In one study of severe CAP, 79% of patients with a \npositive viral PCR also had bacterial infection. \nc. Furthermore, the odds ratio of death was higher in \npatients with concomitant infection 2.1 (1.3-3.3) \n....--...... A positive viral PCR does not c:x:clude concom-\ny \nitant bacterial CAP. \nD. 3.4% of pneumonia are associated with underlying malignancy \n(postobstructive pneumonia) \nE. Complications \n1. Respiratory failure \n2. Sepsis \n3. Death \n4. Empyema (See Chapter 9, Chest Pain) \nF. Prognosis is good overall. \n1. 8% hospitalization rate \n2. 95% radiographic cure in 1 month \n3. Mortality 1.2% \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of CAP is classically made in patients with a \ncombination of infectious symptoms (fever, chills, or rigors), \nrespiratory symptoms (dyspnea) and signs (cough, chest pain, \nand crackles), and infiluate on chest film. \nB. However, patients often lack 1 or more of these elements. \nC. As noted in Table 10-1 neither the absence of fever nor a \nnormal lung exam individually rules out pneumonia (LR-, \n0.6-0.8), so clinicians must maintain a high levd of vigilance. \nHowever, the absence of both fever and abnormal lung find-\nings makes the diagnosis unlikely (LR-, 0.08). \nD. Imaging \n1. Chest radiograph \na. Most commonly used test to diagnose or exclude \npneumonia but imperfect \nb. Sensitivity 71-78%, specificity 59-91 % when \ncompared with chest CT scan or discharge diagnosis \n(LR+, 1.9-8.l; LR-, 0.3-0.4). Additionally, a single \nanterior-posterior chest film has a lower sensitivity than \nposteroanterior and lateral views (59% vs 90%). \nPosteroanterior and lateral chest film views are \nsuperior to single anterior-posterior views and \nshould be obtained when possible. \n\n182 I CHAPTER 10 \nc. False-negative chest films were more common in patients \nwith crackles on exam or a high C-reactive protein. \nA normal chest radiograph does not rule out \npneumonia when the pretest probability is \nhigh (ie, a patient with cough, fever, and \ncrackles). Such patients should still receive \nantibiotics. \ncL Sensitivity may be lower in dehydrated patients. \ne. In CAP, 94% of inflltrates are in the lower and middle \nregions. \nCAP rarely affects the upper lobes; consider \nTB or aspiration pneumonia when upper lobe \ninvolvement is seen. \n2. Chest CT \na. Imaging more detailed than chest radiograph with \nresults that are often different and change management \n(1) In 1 emergency department study, one-third of \npatients with a normal chest film had inflltrates \non CT scan (suggesting that these patients had \npneumonia). \n(2) 30% of patients with an apparent infiltrate on chest \nfilm did not have an infiltrate on CT scan. \n(3) 25% of patients had their antibiotic plan revised \nbased on CT findings. \n(4) 14% of patients had their site of care plan changed \nbased on CT findings. \nb. CT scanning should be considered in the evaluation \nof patients with CAP especially those with clinical or \nlaboratory evidence that favors CAP but have a normal \nchest film. \n3. Ultrasound \na. Ultrasound has not typically been used to diagnose \npatients with CAP. \nb. Meta-analysis reported a wide range in sensitivity \n57-99%, specificity 54-99%, LR+, 1.8-95, and LR-, \n0-0.54; 95% confidence interval sensitivity 80-90%, \nspecificity 70-90%. \nc. The appropriate role of ultrasonography in CAP is \nunclear. \nE. An elevated WBC is neither sensitive nor specific. WBC > \n10,400 cells/mcL: LR+, 3.7; LR-, 0.6 \nF. Procalcitonin \n1. A biomarker expressed in bacterial infections that has been \nevaluated both as a diagnostic tool fur CAP and a tool \nto identify which patients with CAP would benefit from \nantibacterial therapy \n2. Several studies suggest that procalcitonin does not \nadequately identify pneumonia with considerable overlap \nbetween patients with and without CAP \nG. Ltgione/IA urinary antigen is 70-90% sensitive and 99% specific. \nH. PCR \n1. Nucleic acid detection with PCR can identify adenovirus, \ncoronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, \ninfluenza A and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial \nvirus, pertussis, Chlamydophila, and Mycoplasma. \n2. Role in the evaluation of patients with CAP is limited. \na. Nasopharyngeal PCR does not identify common \nbacterial pathogens (eg, S pneumoniae, Legione/IA). \nb. Given the high frequency of bacterial and viral \ncoinfection, documentation of viral infection does not \nexclude bacterial infection nor the need fur antimicrobial \ntherapy. \nc. Limited sensitivity and specificity. \n(1) Specificity < 85%. 15% of asymptomatic \noutpatients have positive nasopharyngeal PCR tests. \n(2) Unlike the excellent sensitivity of nasopharyngeal \nPCR in most patients with influenza, the sensitivity \nof nasopharyngeal PCR is only 50% in patients \nwith severe influenza pneumonia. \n~ \nA negative nasopharyngeal PCR does not \n,.,... exclude viral or bacterial infection. \nTreatment \nA. Prevention \n1. Two vaccines are currently available to prevent invasive \npneumococcal disease: \na. A 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine \n(PPSV 23) and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate \nvaccine (PCV 13) \nb. PCV 13 vaccine has fewer serotypes but generates an \nequivalent or larger immune response. \n2. Vaccine recommendations (ACIP) \na. All adults aged ~ 65 years: PCV 13 should be \nadministered first followed 6-12 months later by \nPPSV23. \nb. Adults who previously received PPSV23 should receive \nPCV 13 at least 1 year later. \nc. Also indicated in adults ~ 19 with any of the following: \nimmunocompromise, asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leak \nor cochlear implants, chronic heart or lung disease, \nadvanced kidney disease. \nB. Evaluation \n1. Chest film is recommended in the evaluation of all patients \nwith suspected CAP. \n2. Evaluate oxygenation in all patients (arterial blood gas \n[ABG] or Sa02). \n3. An ABG is required in patients with respiratory distress, \nparticularly those with preexistent COPD. \nA normal Sa02 on pulse oximetry does not \nexclude hypercarbia and respiratory failure. \nA blood gas to check PaC02 is required in \npatients with respiratory distress. \n4. Determining the causative agent: \na. Although CAP is the most common pneumonia among \noutpatients, clinicians should always consider other less \ncommon pneumonia including aspiration, TB, PJP, \nand hospital-acquired pneumonia {see Figure 10-2), \nwhich may warrant additional testing and therapy \n(see belofur details). \n(1) A history of neurologic impairment or drug abuse \nincreases the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia. \n(2) Chronic symptoms, upper lobe disease, or cavitary \nlesions increase the likelihood ofTB. \n\n(3) Known HIY, HN risk factors or bilateral fluffy \ninfiltrates increase the likdihood of PJP. \n(4) Recent hospitalization warrants coverage for \nhospital-acquired pneumonia. \n(5) Cavitary infiltrates, pleural effusions, and frank \nhemoptysis suggests an exotoxin-producing MRSA \nthat has been increasingly identified in otherwise \nhealthy outpatients with CAP. Patients may also \nhave an erythematous rash and skin pustules. \nb. In the absence of clinical or radiographic clues that \nsuggest other types of pneumonia, most patients \nshould receive treatment covering the most common \nresponsible organisms. \n5. A variety of tests, including sputum culture, sputum Gram \nstain, blood culture, urinary antigen tests for pneumococcus \nand Legionelia, can help determine the pathogen in CAP. \na. The yield of these tests in outpatients with CAP is lo\nand routine testing is optional in outpatients. \nb. Spurum cultures are often unreliable due to contamination \nby oral flora. \n(1) Normal flora should not be misinterpreted to mean \nno infection. \n(2) Positive in 14-19% of patients with S pneumoniae. \n(3) When positive, sputum cultures can help determine \nthe resistance pattern. \nc. Sputum Gram stains are also often unreliable due to \npoor quality, preparation, and interpretation. \n(1) Overall, only 14% of hospitalized patients had an \nadequate specimen with a dominant organism. \nCOUGH, FEVER, AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS I 183 \n(2) Positive in 63-80% of patients with pneumococcal \nbacteremia \nd. Blood cultures positive in 5-14% of all patients with \nCAP and 39-57% of patients with S pneumoniae. \ne. Urinary antigen for S pneumoniae is positive in 30-89% \nof patients. \n The true sensitivity of each of these tests is likdy to be \nlower due to the lack of a gold standard for diagnosis (eg, \ntissue culture). One study suggested that S pneumoniae \ncaused the majority of cases of CAP in patients with \nnegative conventional tests (sputum culture, blood \nculture, and urine antigen). \n~ \nS p~eumoniae is not ruled out with conventional \ny \ntesting. \ng. The IDSA has published guidelines for more extensive \ntesting on select inpatients {Table 10-5). Some authorities \nalso recommend influenza testing during the influenza \nseason, especially in patients with CAP that may require \nICU admission, or associated with liver disease, lung \ndisease, or asplenia. \nh. Patients with severe pneumonia should have blood and \nsputum cultures, sputum Gram stain, and urinary tests \nfor pneumococcal and Legionelia antigen. \ni. PCR testing: See above \n6. Patients with pleural effusions require diagnostic thoracentesis \nto rule out empyema or complicated parapneumonic \neffusions, which require chest tube drainage in addition to \nantibiotics (see Chapter 9, Chest Pain). \nTable 10-5.

Prospective validated clinical tools can hdp predict \nmortality and guide the need for admission, including the \npneumonia severity index and the CURB-65 score \na. CURB-65 criteria are confusion (to person, place, or \ntime), uremia (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] > 20 mgldL), \nRR <?: 30 breaths per minute, systolic BP < 90 mm Hg \nor diastolic BP S 60 mm Hg. age <?: 65. \nb. Scores of<?: 1 are associated with an increased mortality \nand the need for hospital admission. \nc. While validated scores can guide decisions, they \nshould not be viewed as absolute and clinical \njudgment remains important. Patients with similar \nscores can have markedly different mortality rates. \nAmong patients with the same CURB-65 score, the \nmonality rate in patients deemed to need admission \nwas 1.7-26 times higher than patients not felt to \nneed admission. \nD. Determine the need fur ICU admission: The IDSA and the \nAmerican Thoracic Society have published guidelines on ICU \nadmissioru fur patients with severe pneumonia. ICU admis-\nsion is recommended for patients with septic shock requiring \nvasopressors and those receiving mechanical ventilation as \nwdl as patients with <?: 3 minor criteria (RR <?: 30 breaths per \nminute, Pa0/Fi02 ratio S 250, multilobar infiltrates, confu-\nsion, BUN<?: 20 mg/dL, WBC < 4000 cells/mL, platdet count \n< 100,000 cells/ mL, temperature < 36\"C, or hypoteruion \nrequiring aggressive fluid resuscitation). \nE. Antibiotics \nI. Neither the history and physical exam nor chest racliograph \ncan rdiably distinguish pyogenic (S pneumoniae) &om \natypical (Mycoplasma and Chlamydia) organisms and \ntreatment must cover both. \n2. Penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae (PRSP) \na. Increasing in the United States \nb. Marked geographic variability in frequency of resistance \nbut up to 65% in some areas \nc. PRSP often resistant to cephalosporins and macrolides \nbut not quinolones with extended activity against \nS pneumoniae. \n3. Empiric therapy \na. Outpatients \n(I) Previously healthy outpatients are usually treated \nwith an advanced macrolide (azithromycin or \nclarithromycin) or doxycycline. (Macrolides are \npreferred.) \n(2) Certain patients require alternative therapy with \neither a respiratory quinolone (moxifloxacin, \nlevofloxacin, or gemifloxacin) or combination \ntherapy of a beta.-lactam (amoxicillin or amoxicillin-\nclavulanate or cefpodoxime) and macrolide. Those \npatients include those with any of the following: \n(a) Comorbidities (heart, lung, liver, or kidney \ndisease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; cancer; \nasplenia; immunosuppression} \n(b) Antibiotic use within the last 3 months \n(c) Exposure to children in day care centers \n(increasing the risk for S pneumoniae resistance} \n(d) Evidence of pneumococcal pneumonia \n(diplococci on Gram stain, positive \npneumococcal urine antigen, positive sputum \nculture for pneumococcus, or sudden onset of \nhigh fever and rigors} \n(e) Areas with a rate of macrolide resistance > 25% \nb. Inpatients should be treated with an advanced \nmacrolide with a beta~lactam (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or \narnpicillin-sulbactam) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone \n(levofloxacin or moxifloxacin). \nc. Administration within 3 hours of presentation is \nrecommended and within 1 hour for patients in shock \nd. Procalcitonin to Guide Initiating antibiotics. Fe\nstudies have evaluated the decision to treat or withhold \nantibiotics in patients with CAP based on their \nprocalcitonin levd. There is insufficient evidence to \nwarrant withholding antibiotics in patients with CAP \nbased on a loprocalcitonin level. \nF. Follow-up chest film \n1. 3.4% of pneumonias are associated with an underlying \ntumor (postobstructive pneumonia) that may be obscured \nby the infiltrate. \n2. Follow-up radiography can ensure pneumonia resolution \nand reveal an underlying mass. \n3. Particularly important in patients at increased risk for lung \ncancer, including patients over 50 or current or ex-smokers. \n4. Chest film resolution lags behind clinical resolution. \na. By day 10, most patients have clinical resolution but \nonly 31 % had a normal chest radiograph. 68% of \npatients had a normal chest radiograph by day 28. \nb. Follow-up chest film should be performed promptly in \nany patient with clinical deterioration and after day 28 \nin patients at risk for malignancy. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nHave you c:roseed a dlagnoetlc: threshold for \nthe leading hypothe&ls, CAP?

Mr. P has several concern-\ning signs and symptoms that suggest pneumonia (rather than an \nupper respiratory infection or acute bronchitis) including his dysp-\nnea and crackles. Clearly a chest radiograph is indicated. \nPA'flENT W \nHis chest radi09raph demonstrates 17ilateral diffuse infil-\ntrates (Figure 10-5). No cardiomegaly 15 seen. A C6C Is \nnormal.

He admits to drinkitl{j heavily. often a pint \nof gin per day, and occasionally losing consciousness. He \ndoes not remember any episodes of vomiting and aspirat-\ning.

His \nalcohol use clearly increases the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia \n(even in the absence of known frank aspiration). Alcoholism, sub-\nstance abuse, and neurologic disorders are leading risk factors for \naspiration, and make this the leading hypothesis. Another impor-\ntant clinical clue is his long duration of illness, which suggests more \nchronic processes such as TB or PJP. TB is also more common in \nalcoholic patients and malnourished patients. Given the public \nhealth risks, TB is a must not miss possibility. \nHis radiograph (Figure 10-5) reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates, \nwhich is typical of PJP (and can also be seen in Mycoplasma and \ninfluenza pneumonia). The long duration of symptoms is more \nsuggestive of PJP, which due to its life-threatening nature and \nrequirement for specific therapy is another must not miss hypoth-\nesis. PJP affects immunocompromised patients, including patients \non chemotherapy, other immunosuppressive medications, and \nHN-infected patients. It is important to consider PJP even in \npatients without a history of immunosuppressive therapy or known \nHN infection because PJP can be the pmenting illness in patients \nwith HIV infection. It is important to appreciate that the sexual \nhistory often fails to elicit high-risk sexual behavior.

Classic symptoms include fever, cough, \nchest pain, and putrid spurum. The syndrome most commonly \nevolves over days to weeks rather than acutely. \nDisease Highlights \nA. There are 2 types of aspiration: Small volume aspiration, typi-\ncally of oropharyngeal secretions, and large volume aspiration, \ntypically of gastric contents. \nI. Aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal secretions is common \nand usually unnoticed. It may be complicated by aspiration \npneumonia when the combination of a large bacterial \nload (due to poor dentition) and virulence overcome host \ndefenses (particularly cough). \nTable 1C>-6.

Gastric acid aspiration may result in chemical damage \n(aspiration pneumonitis), which may be accompanied by \nsubsequent infection (aspiration pneumonia). \nB. Risk factors for aspiration \n1. Neurologic disease (dementia, cerebrovascular accident, \nseizures) \n2. Sedation (illicit drug or alcohol overdose, general anesthesia) \n3. Dysphagia (status post head and neck surgery) \n4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting \nS. Endoscopy, tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, nasogastric feeding \nC. Aspiration pneumonitis \n1. Aspirated contents with lower pHs and larger volumes lead \nto more damage \n2. Clinical syndrome \nL Usually follows large volume aspiration (ie, during \nanesthesia) \nb. Cyanosis, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates \ndevelop within 2 hours. \nc. Fever is usually lograde. \n\nd. Sputum may be putrid. \ne. Outcome varies \n(1) Rapid recovery within 24-36 hours (62%) \n(2) Bacterial superinfection (26%), which may lead to \npneumonia, lung abscess, or empyema \n(3) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (12%) \nD. Aspiration pneumonia refers to infection due to aspirated \norganisms. \n1. Accounts for 5-15% of pneumonias \n2. Poor dentition increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. \n3. Clinical features include cough, fever, sputum production, \nand shortness of breath, which may progress over days \nto weeks. \n4. Organisms \na. Pathogens commonly seen in patients coming from \nthe community with aspiration pneumonia include \nanaerobes, aerobic streptococci, S pneumoniae, S aureus, \nand Haemophilus influmzae. \nb. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonias may be caused \nby anaerobes, gram-negative organisms (including \nPseudomonas), or S aumu. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Often presumptive based on aspiration risk factors, putrid \nsputum, and typical chest film. Many patients have periodon-\ntal disease. \nB. Oropharyngeal motility studies can identify certain patients at \nrisk, particularly those with neurologic impairment. \nC. Rigors and acute onset suggest more virulent organisms \n(ie, S pneumoniae and S aumu}. \nD. Chest film \n1. Aspiration pneumonia classically involves the basal segment \nof lower lobes but can involve the posterior segments of \nthe upper lobes if aspiration occurred while the patient was \nrecumbent. \n2. Cavitation is more common in aspiration pneumonia than \nin CAP. \nTreatment \nA. Prevention \n1. A recent Cochrane analysis concluded that food thickening \nstrategies are ineffective in preventing aspiration. \n2. Tube feedings \na. Decrease the incidence of aspiration pneumonia \nin patients with dysphagia (54% vs 13% with oral \nfeeding). \nb. Main utility is in patients with short-term indications \n(eg, head and neck surgery). \nc. Despite tube feedings, patients can still aspirate from \ngastroesophageal reflux, vomiting, and aspiration of \noropharyngeal contents. \nd. Not recommended by the American Geriatrics Society \nfor the long-term care of patients with advanced \ndementia as they cause more agitation, use of physical \nand chemical restraints, require greater resource \nutilization, cause tube-related complications, and do \nnot decrease the incidence of aspiration pneumonia or \nimprove survival in these patients. \nCOUGH, FEVER, AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS I 187 \n3. Several studies suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme \n(ACE) inhibitors increase the cough reflex and decrease the \nrate of pneumonia in persons at-risk (NNT 9-19). \n4, Amantadine promotes dopamine release (which facilitates \ncough and decreases dysphagia). It also has been shown \nto decrease the rate of pneumonia in elderly patients with \nprior stroke (NNT 4.3). \n5. Oral hygiene with brushing after each meal and professional \noral health care each week decreased the incidence of \npneumonia in elderly nursing home patients (18.6% vs. \n11.4% NNT 14). \n6. Postprandial semi-recumbent positions decrease the rate of \naspiration pneumonia compared with supine positions. \nB. Supportive treatment \n1. Suction any material in airway. \n2. Intubation if necessary for ventilation, oxygenation, \nor to protect airway in patients with altered level of \nconsciousness. \nC. Aspiration pneumonitis \n1. Antibiotics \na. Often used initially due to the high frequency of \nsubsequent superinfection. \nb. Can be discontinued if no infiltrates develop within \n48-72 hours. \nc. Pneumonia is more likely in patients with gastric \ncolonization (resulting from a H2-blocker, proton pump \ninhibitor, or from bowel obstruction). \n2. Corticosteroids are controversial. \nD. Aspiration pneumonia: antibiotics are indicated. \n1. Community-acquired aspiration: First-line options include \nampicillin/sulbactam or amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin \nwith metronidazole. Clindamycin can be used in penicillin-\nallergic patients. \n2. Hospital-acquired aspiration: Coverage requires addition \nof an antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative \norganisms, anaerobes, and S aumu. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nAlthough the patient's CURB-65 score is 0, his hypoxia \nand alcohol use disorder make admi55ion mandatory. Mr. P \nIs admitted to an Isolation bed on the general medical floor. \nHe Is empirically treated with cl!ndamycln (for presumed \naspiration pneu mon!a) as well as azlthromycln and ceftrlax-\none (for CAP). \nHave you c::ro95Bd a diagnostic thruhold for \nthe leading hypothesis, aspiration pneumonia1 \nHave you rulsd out the ac::tlvs alternatlvse T5 \nand PJP1 Do other teet9 ns&I to be dons to \nexc::lude the altematlve dlagnosle1 \nAt this point, it is appropriate to order blood cultures, sputum \ncultures, and Gram stain. Although he has risk factors for aspira-\ntion pneumonia, it remains important to consider the other must \nnot miss hypotheses. The patient's chest radiograph does not have \nany features that suggest TB (see below}, which makes TB less \nlikely. Nonethdess, PPD placement or QuantiFERON testing and \n\n188 I CHAPTER 10 \nobtaining sputum for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) stain and culture \nwould be reasonable. However, the diffuse bilateral symmetric infil-\ntrates are strongly suggestive of PJP, which must be considered (and \nHN infection ruled out), despite the lack of obvious risk factors. \nAlternative Diagnosis: PJP \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with PJP are immunosuppressed, commonly due to pre-\nviously diagnosed or undiagnosed advanced HIV disease. Patients \ncommonly complain of progressive shortness of breath and dry \ncough of 1-3 weeks duration. \nPJP is often the presenting manifestation of AIDS. \nSuspect PJP in patients with diffuse bilateral \npneumonia, particularly of subacute onset. \nDisease Highlights \nA. PJP is caused by the ubiquitous opporrunistlc fungus P jirovecii. \nColonization is present in > 50% of the adult population. \nIn immunocompromised patients, it may cause a diffuse, \nbilateral, subacute but severe pneumonia. \nB. Epidemiology \n1. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia in immunocompromised \npersons including: \na. HN-infected persons with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mcL. \n(1) PJP is the most prevalent opportunistic infection in \nHIV-infected persons. \n(2) However, with the advent of antiretroviral therapy \nand PJP prophylaxis, the incidence of PJP has \ndropped dramatically among HN-infected persons \n(> lOx) and the majority of PJP cases nooccur in \nnon-HIV-infected immunocompromised persons. \nb. Non-HIV-infected patients: \n(1) PJP may occur in patients who are receiving \ncorticosteroids, chemotherapy, or other \nimmunosuppressive therapies. \n(2) PJP may also occur in patients with idiopathic CD4 \nlymphocytopenia \n(3) Unlike HN-infected patients, these patients often \nhave a higher mean CD4 count when PJP develops \n(mean 302-487 cells/mcL). \n~ \nA CD4 count > 200 cells/mcL does not rule out \ny \nPJP in non-HN-immunosuppressed persons. \n(4) Non-HIV-infected persons with PJP also experience \nhigher mortality from PJP than HN-infected \npersons (30-60% vs. 7%) probably secondary to a \ndelay in diagnosis. \nC. The course is typically subacute in HN-infected persons (over \nweeks) but may present more acutely (days) in patients with \nother immunocompromised states. \nD. The remainder of the discussion focuses on HN-infected \npersons with PJP. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \n1. Fever is present in 79-100% of cases. \n2. Cough is present in 95% of cases. It is usually (but not \nalways) nonproductive. \n3. Progressive dyspnea is present in 95% of cases. \nB. Physical exam \n1. Fever is present in 84%. \n2. Tachypnea is present in 62%. \n3. Chest auscultation is normal in 50% of cases. \nC. Chest film \n1. Usually shows diffuse symmetric bilateral alveolar or \ninterstitial infiltrates (81-93% of cases) \nSuspect PJP in patients with diffuse bilateral \npneumonia, even in those without a diagnosis \nof HIV or known immunocompromise. PJP is \na common mode of presentation in patients \ninfected with HIV. \n2. In HN-infected patients, interstitial infiltrates are present \nin 69% of patients and increase the likelihood of PJP \n(versus TB or bacterial pneumonia) (LR+, 4.25). \n3. Isolated upper lobe disease may be seen in patients taking \ninhaled pentamidine as PJP prophylaxis. \n4. Occasionally shows pneumothorax \n5. Normal in 10-25% of cases \nPJP should be considered in dyspneic patients \nwith HIV and CD4 counts < 200 cells/mcL \neven when the chest exam and chest radio-\ngraph are normal. \nD. Specific diagnostic tests \n1. Although the chest radiograph and lactate dehydrogenase \n(see below) can increase or decrease the likelihood of PJP, \npatients require specific tests to confirm or exclude PJP. \n2. Clinical diagnosis (without confirmation by staining of \nsputum or BAL) is incorrect in 43% of patients. \n3. Induced sputum are typically the first test used to \ndiagnose PJP. \na. 55-92% sensitive, 100% specific \nb. The addition of immunofluorescent monoclonal \nstaining increases sensitivity. \n4. BAL is used to diagnose PJP when sputum stains are \nnegative. \na. Diagnosis is based on staining the fluid obtained during \nBAL. \nb. Silver, Giemsa, or immunofluorescent staining using \nmonoclonal antibodies have been used. \nc. Sensitivity is 86-97%. \nd. Sensitivity ofBAL is lower (62%) after inhaled \npentamidine prophylaxis. Transbronchial biopsy \nimproves the diagnostic yield in these patients. \ne. PCR \n(1) Highly sensitive (100%) and specific \n(2) Identifies both PJP infection and colonization. \n(3) Q]lan#ta#ve cutoffs can help distinguish colonization \nfrom infection. \n(4) Since patients with PJP who are not HN infected \nhave lower fungal burdens, different cutoffs may be \nappropriate. \n\n5. The most common diagnostic strategy is sputum analysis \nwith silver stain and immunofluorescence. Positive results \nconfirm PJP. Negative results should prompt BAL. \nE. Nonspecifk diagnostic tests \n1. Serum 1,3-beta-D-glucan \na. A cell wall component of Pneumocystis and other fungi \n(Candida, .AspergiUus, but not Cryptococcus). Also found \nin Pstutlomonas. \nb. Sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 84%; LR+, 6.0; LR-, 0.05 \nc. May prove to be a useful serum tool to rule out PJP if \nnegative, but given the lospecificity, other tests would \nbe needed to confirm PJP if positive. \nd. Also can be elevated in invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis \n2. High-resolution chest CT scan \na. In PJP, the CT typically shows patchy or nodular \nground-glass appearance; ground glass most marked in \nperihilar regions. Cystic lesions may be seen. \nb. 100% sensitive, 83-89% specific \nc. LR+, 5.9; LR-, O \n3. Pulmonary function tests \na. Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lungs \n(DLCO) is usually loin PJP and highly sensitive. \nb. Likelihood of PJP is< 2% ifDLCO is> 75% predicted. \nTreattnent \nA. Antimicrobial therapy \n1. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the initial \ntreatment of choice. \n2. Side effects are common including rash, fever, gastrointestinal \nsymptoms, hepatitis, neutropenia, and hyperkalemia. CBC, \nliver biochemical tests, and K should be monitored. \n3. Antibiotic therapy may markedly worsen preexisting \nhypoxia. Many patients require concomitant corticosteroids \nto prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (see below). \n4. Alternatives are available for patients intolerant ofTMP-\nSMX but some allergic patients may be desensitized. \n5. Occasional resistance to TMP-SMX has been reported. \n6. Other options reserved for patients with mild to moderate \nPJP infections include clindamycin plus primaquine, \ndapsone plus TMP or atovaquone. \nB. Corticosteroids \n1. Reduce mortality and respiratory failure in patients with \nsevere PJP treated with TMP-SMX (relative risk for \nmortality 0.56) \n2. Initiate at time of PJP therapy if room air PaO 2 < 70 mm Hg \nor the A-a gradient :il: 35 mm Hg. \n3. Should be added to patients who do not initially qualify \nfor corticosteroid treatment but deteriorate while taking \nTMP-SMX. \n4, Prednisone 40 mg twice daily for 5 days, then 40 mg daily \nfor 5 days, then 20 mg daily for 11 days. \n~ \nConcomitant corticosteroid therapy is lifesaving \n,.,.. in patients with PJP whose Pa02 < 70 mm Hg. \nC. Antiretroviral therapy should also be initiated within 2 weeks \nof treatment for PJP in HN-infected patients (not already \nreceiving antiretroviral therapy). \nCOUGH, FEVER, AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS I 189 \nD. Prophylaxis \n1. Indications \na. HIV-infected persons with any of the following: \n(1) Prior PJP \n(2) CD4 counts< 200 cells/mcL or< 14% \n(3) HN-infected patients with unexplained \npersistent fevers or oral candidiasis for more \nthan 2 weeks \n(4) Any AIDS defining illness \nb. Non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients: \n(1) Patients with acute lymphoblastk leukemia, and \nthose receiving solid organ or allogeneic bone \nmarrotransplantation (NNT 19). \n(2) A Cochrane Reviealso recommended prophylaxis \nfor patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis \nand patients with solid organ malignancies taking \ncorticosteroids. \n(3) Other groups have recommended PJP prophylaxis \nfor a large number of other conditions requiring an \narray of immunosuppressive medications. \n2. TMP-SMX is superior to pentamidine and the drug of \nchoice. In addition, it is effective prophylaxis against \ntoxoplasmosis and some bacterial infections. \n3. Significant adverse reactions are common with TMP-SMX. \nRash, fever, neutropenia, and hypotension may necessitate \ndiscontinuation ofTMP-SMX. \n4. Dapsone, atovaquone, and inhaled pentamidine are \nalternative therapies in patients intolerant ofTMP~SMX. \nSome authorities recommend screening patients for \nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency \nprior to instituting dapsone. \nS. In HN-infected persons, antiretroviral therapy can \nrestore the CD4 count and allofor discontinuation \nof prophylaxis when CD4 count> 200 cells/mcL for \napproximately 3 months {unless PJP devdoped in patients \nwith CD4 counts above 200 cells/mcL). \n\nBecause Mr. P's radlO(:!raph was t ypical for PJP, an HIV and \nCD4 count were ordered. TMP-SMX and corticosteroids \nwere added empirically to his antibiotic regimen pending \nresults of t he evaluation. \nAlternative Diagnosis: TB \nTextbook Presentation \nTB pneumonia usually develops due to reactivation of latent \nmycobacteria residing in the upper lobes. Symptoms are chronic \nand include cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. By the time \npatients seek medical attention, they have often had these symp-\ntoms for weeks or months. The weight loss and duration of symp-\ntoms often suggest cancer. \nOisea5e Highlights \nA. Obligate aerobe that has predilection for lung apices. \nB. The organism is slogrowing; the generation time is \n20-24 hours, resulting in sloprogression. \n\n190 I CHAPTER 10 \nC. Common and serious \n1. Infects 33% of the world's population \n2. 8.6 million necases per year (2014 data) and 1.5 million \ndeaths (worldwide) \n3. 95% of cases occur in developing countries. \nD. Epidemiology \n1. An estimated 11 million persons are infected with TB in \nthe United States. \n2. Foreign-born persons have the highest rate ofTB (13.4 times \nhigher than US-born persons) and account for 66% ofTB \ncases in the United States and 85% of multidrug-resistant \nTB (MOR-TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin). \n3. Asians, blacks, and Hispanics have higher rates ofTB than \nwhites (22.9, 8.3, and 7.4 times, respectively). Foreign-born \npersons account for a majority ofTB cases in Asians and \nHispanics but not blacks. \n4. 67% of cases occur in the nonwhite population. \n5. In the nonwhite population, the median age is 39. In whites, \nthe median age is 62. \n6. Reactivation TB accounts for 90% ofTB in older patients \nand 67% ofTB in younger patients. \n7. High-risk groups \na. HIV \n(1) HIV-infected patients are at highest risk for TB \n(200 times increased incidence). \n(2) In 2011, HIV-infected persons accounted for \n1.1 million TB cases worldwide ( 13% of the total). \n(3) TB may be the first manifestation of HIY. \n~ \nPatients with active or latent TB should be \ny \ntested for HIY. \n(4) Extrapulmonary TB without pulmonary disease is \nmore common in patients with AIDS (30%) than \nin those without AIDS (15%). \n(5) The presentation of pulmonary TB in early HIV \ninfection is similar to that in immunocompetent \npersons; whereas, in advanced HIV infection, \nTB presents in more atypical ways. \nb. Alcoholics \nc. Other high-risk groups \n(1) Foreign-born persons \n(2) Immunosuppressed patients (including patients \ntaking corticosteroids) \n(3) Patients with cancer, diabetes mellitus, end-stage \nrenal disease, transplants, or malnutrition \n(4) PPD-positive patients \n(5) Patients with evidence of prior TB on chest fllm \n(6) Economically disadvantaged, inner city residents \n(7) Nursing home residents \n(8) Drug-dependent persons, homeless persons, prison \ninmates \nE. Pathophysiology \n1. Inhaled organism lands in the middle and lower lobes (due \nto increased ventilation). \n2. Multiplies over next 3 weeks, spreads to hilar nodes and \noften bloodstream, seeding more distant anatomic sites. \n3. Organism reproduces preferentially in areas of high PaO \n(lung apices, renal cortex, venebrae). \n4. In 90% of patients, the immune system then contains the \norganism resulting in typical scarring (Ghan complex). \nHowever, the chest fllm can be normal. \n5. Above sequence usually asymptomatic. \n6. In some patients, a feviable organisms remain. This is \nreferred to as latent TB infection. Latent TB can reactivate \nlater (reacmation TB). \n7. The PPD is positive 6-8 weeks after the initial infection. \nThese patients are resistant to subsequent exogenous \ninfection (but not reactivation). \n8. Primary TB \na. In approximately 10% of patients (higher in \nimmunocompromised patients and children), \nthe initial infection is not controlled and causes \nprimary TB. \nb. Primary TB accounts for 23-34% of adult cases. \nc. Fever is the most common symptom (70%) and usually \noccurs in isolation. \nd. Chest radiograph usually shows consolidation (50%). \n(1) Disease is usually unifocal {75%) but may be \nmultifocal. \n(2) Usually involves lower and middle lobes (63% of cases). \n(3) Lymphadenopathy is seen in 10-67% of adults and \nis rarely the sole radiologic manifestation. \n(4) Pleural effusions, usually unilateral, develop in 24% \nand may occur with or without infiltrates. \n(5) Normal in 15% of patients with primary \npulmonary TB \n(6) Other findings include miliary pattern 6%, \ncavitation 15%. \nc. Often occurs in those unable to mount a sensitized \nmacrophage response. \nf. PPD may be negative in these patients. \ng. Most cases of primary TB resolve spontaneously without \ntreatment. \nh. Pneumonia progresses without treatment in 10-15% of \npatients. \n9. Reactivation TB \na. 4-6% of patients with latent TB infection experience \nreactivation during their lifetime. The greatest risk is in \nthe first 2 years following infection. \nb. Reactivation is often due to declining immune function. \nRisk factors include HIY, immunosuppressive therapy, \ndiabetes mellitus, and silicosis. Children are also at \nhigher risk. \nc. Reactivation TB results in 90% of adult non-AIDS-\nrelated TB. \nd. Due to the high rate of latent TB infection in foreign-\nborn persons, they account for 71 % of cases or \nreactivation TB. \nc. Symptoms are usually insidious and include chronic \ncough, weight loss, night sweats, anorexia, and low- or \nhigh-grade fevers. \nf. Reactivation TB progresses unless the patient is treated. \n\n10. Pleural TB: May cause either tuberculous empyema or \ntuberculous pleural effusions. \na. Tuberculous empyema \n(1) Rare \n(2) Secondary to direct infection of pleural space \n(often from rupture of the neighboring tuberculous \ncavity) \n(3) Pleural fluid characterized by pus and numerous TB \norganisms \nb. Tuberculous effusions \n(1) Tuberculous effusions result from a ddayed \nhypersensitivity reaction to mycobacterial antigens \nin the pleural space. \n(2) Usually associated with reactivation disease in adults \n(75%) \n(3) Typical features include acute high fever, cough \n(94%), and pleuritic chest pain (78%). \n(4) Chest radiograph shows unilateral effusion in 95% \nof cases. Parenchymal infiltrate is seen in 50% of \ncases. \n(5) Effusion is usually exudative {see bdow). \n(6) PPD is usually positive (69-93%). \n11. Extrapulmonary TB may involve the spine, kidney, \npericardium, and central nervous system. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. A variety of risk factors, symptoms, and radiographic findings \ncan suggest TB (Table 10-7). Sensitivity is likdy to be over-\nestimated because TB was not systematically evaluated in all \npatients. \n1. Risk factors: The most important risk factors are immigrant \nfrom TB endemic areas (LR+, 4.1), history of positive PPD \ntest (LR+, 3.8), or history ofTB (LR+, 3.6) \n2. Symptoms \na. No symptom is terribly sensitive for TB. Weight loss \nand cough for > 2 weeks increase the likdihood ofTB \nmore significantly than night sweats or hemoptysis. \nb. Hemoptysis was neither sensitive nor specific for TB. \nc. Fever is present in only 55%. \nd. Other clues may include lack of systemic toxicity or \nfailure to respond to antibacterial therapy. \nPatients with TB may complain primarily of \nweight loss or night sweats and have a normal \nlung exam. Fever and hemoptysis may be \nabsent. Pulmonary TB still needs to be consid-\nered in such patients. \ne. Symptoms and risk factors for disease tend to vary \nbetween older patients who often have reactivation TB \nand younger patients in whom primary TB is more \ncommon. Compared with older patients, younger \npatients have a higher incidence of alcoholism (66% vs \n37%). In addition, younger patients more frequently \nhave fever (62% vs 31 %), night sweats (48% vs 6%), \nand hemoptysis (40% vs 17%). \n3. Radiography \na.. Pulmonary TB is very unlikdy in patients with a normal \nchest film (97% sensitive). \nCOUGH, FEVER, AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS I 191 \nTable 10-7.

Cavitary disease and apical disease markedly increase the \nlikelihood ofTB (LR+, 8.3 and 4.8, respectivdy}. \nc. Most patients with TB have 1 of 3 radiographic \npatterns: apical, cavitary, or reticulonodular disease \n(LR+, 5.0; LR-, 0.16). \nTB should be considered in patients with \napical, cavitary, or reticulonodular patterns \non chest radiograph. TB is unlikely if none of \nthese features are present. \nd. Calcification can be seen in active lesions and does not \nexclude active disease unless comparison to prior films \ndemonstrates stability. \ne. The chest radiograph in HN-positive patients is often \natypical (see Chapter 5, AIDS/HIV). \nB. Clinical decision rules: \n1. A variety of clinical decision rules can hdp determine the \nlikdihood of TB in patients with pneumonia and the need \nfor isolation on admission. \n2. None have ideal sensitivity and specificity. \n3. High sensitivity is preferred to ensure patients with TB are \nisolated and reduce the risk of nosocornial transmission ofTB. \n4. The clinical decision rules with the highest sensitivity \n(96-98% sensitive, 20-48% specific) categorized patients \nat high risk if they had any of the following risk factors: \na.. Immigrants from TB prevalent areas \nb. Positive TB history or history of positive PPD \n\n192 I CHAPTER 10 \nc. Homelessness, incar1:eration \nd. Weight loss \ne.

Specificity is 98-99% but is lower in patients with \nnontuberculous mycobacrerial infection and in \npatients who received bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) \nvaccination after infancy. \n(1) BCG is a TB Va1:cine used in some oountries to \nprevent TB. \n(2) BCG has some similarities to PPD and may cause \nfalse-positive PPD reactions. \n(a) False-positive PPD rea1:tions (~ 10 mm) are rare \nin adults who received BCG in infancy (=1 %). \n(b) However, false-positives are more oommon in \nBCG recipients who were vaccinated ~ 2 years \nof age (40%). False-positive PPDs remained \noommon in this group even more than 10 years \nlater (20%). \nh. Booster phenomenon occurs when an initially negative \nTST is positive on recheck (without neinfection). \n(1) In patients with latent TB, TST may revert to \nnegative many years after infection. \n(2) In sum patients, the initial TST may be negative \nbut stimulate immune memory cells sum that \nsubsequent TST tests may be positive. \n(3) Subsequent positive tests may be misinterpreted as \nrecent conversion. \n(4) Misinterpretation can be avoided by performing the \n2-step skin tests in patients smeduled for annual TST. \n(a) Patients with initial negative PPD are retested \n1-3 weeks later. \n(b) Patients in whom the second PPD test is \npositive should be treated as though the first test \nwas positive. \n(c) Patients in whom the second PPD test is \nnegative are truly negative. Any furore positive \nreacions in these patients should be oonsidered \nrecent conversions. \n2. Interferon-gamma releasing assays (IGRAs) \na. Current IGRAs include the QTF-GIT and T-SPOT.TB \nassays \nb. Patient's blood (or other bodily fluid) is mixed with \nhighly spe1:ifi1: TB antigens that are not shared with \nBCG or most nontuber1:ulous mycoba1:teria. \nc. Be1:ause of the high specificity of the antigens used, \nprior BCG Va1:cination does not cause false-positive \nIGRA results (unlike TST). \nd. The lymphocytes from TB-infe1:ted patients (latent or \nactive) produce interferon gamma when exposed to TB \nantigens. The interferon gamma is measured. \ne.

Positive results do not distinguish latent from a1:tive \nTB. (A patient with pneumonia and a positive IGRA \noould have TB pneumonia or a nontuberculous \npneumonia (eg, streptococcal) and latent TB infection. \nh. Negative tests decrease the likelihood ofTB infecrion \nbut are not sufficiently sensitive to rule out a1:tive TB \nwhen the clinic:al suspicion is high (LR-, 0.13-0.25). \n,-. NeitherTST nor IGRA rule in or rule out \ny \nactive TB in patients with pneumonia. \n3. Strategy: Testing for latent TB infection (Figure 10-6) \na. Two facrors should be considered when testing for LTBI \n(1) Risk ofTB infecrion \n(2) Risk of progression to a1:tive TB if infected \nb. Major risk factors for infection include the following: \n(1) Household contal:ts of known TB (23% ofTB \noontacts are TST positive). \n(l) Recent TST or IGRA oonverters \n(3) Work exposures (mycobacterial lab personnd or \nemployees or residents of high-risk congregates) \n(4) Immigrants from high burden oountries {Most of \nSub-Saharan Africa and Asia (including China and \nIndia), Brazil and Russia \nc.

Patients with major risk factors for infection: \n(1) Test if antitubcrculous therapy would be considered. \n(2) The appropriate testing strategy and criteria \nfor positive results arc stratified by their risk \nof progression. (Criteria fur patients at lorisk \nfor infection is a positive IGRA and induration \nfollowing TST > 1 S mm; whereas, for those at \nhighest risk, the criteria is only positive IGRA or \ninduration following TST ~ 5mm) (Figure 10-6). \n(3) Patients with positive results \n(a) Evaluate for active TB prior to starting latent \nTB treatment \n(b) Evaluation should include revieof symptoms \nand chest film (regardless of symptoms). \n(c) Patients with evidence of active TB should be \nappropriatdy evaluated. \n4. Testing for active pulmonary TB \na. Multiple tests are available and include microscopy \n(smear), NAAT (see below) and culture. \nb. All 3 tests recommended in patients evaluated for active TB \nby the American Thoracic Society/IDSNCDC guiddines \n(1) TST and IGRAs can be done but do not distinguish \nactive from latent TB infection nor arc they \nsufficiently sensitive to rule out TB. \n(2) AFB stain and culture \n(a) Culture is the gold standard and specific but can \ntake weeks to turn positive. \n(b) Sensitivity depends on the number of specimens \n(Table 10-8). \n(3) AFB smear (microscopy) \n(a) Ziehl-Nedsen (acid-fast stain) 70% sensitive, \n90% specific. \ni. False-positive smears may occur due to \nnontuberculous mycobacteria. \nii. False-negative smears may be seen in \npatients with inadequate specimens or small \nmycobacterial loads. \n(b) Patients with positive smears are more infectious \nthan patients who are culture positive but have \nnegative smears; 35% of family members of \npersons with positive smears are PPD positive \ncompared with 9% of family members when \npatients are smear negative. \n(c) Fluorochrome dyes can be used and are more \nsensitive but still detect nontuberculous \nmycobacteria. \nTable 10-8.

Diagnostic strategy: Recent guidelines suggest simulta-\nneously testing using microscopy, NAAT, and culture. \na. Consider testing in patients with risk factors, symptoms \nor typical radiographic findings suggestive ofTB \n(Figure 10-7). \nb. While awaiting culture, the combined results ofNAAT \nand microscopy can guide decisions. \nc. Patients with both negative microscopy and negative \nNAAT have a lolikelihood ofTB (< 5%) and can be \nobserved pending culture. \nd. Patients with both positive microscopy and positive \nNAAT have a high likelihood ofTB (> 90%) and \nshould be treated pending culture. \ne. The likelihood ofTB in patients with discordant smear \nand NAAT results is indeterminate with a wide and \nclinically significant range (2-75%)! Posttest probability \nis affected by the pretest probability of disease and \nwhich test was positive (NAAT or smear). \nf. Figure 10-7 illustrates an approach to the interpretation \nof smear microscopy and NAAT in patients evaluated \nfor TB. The likelihood of TB is calculated using the \nsensitivities and specificities above and estimating the \nincidence of TB in patients with a loclinical suspicion \nat = 5% and in patients with a high clinical suspicion \n=30%. \n6. Bronchoscopy: Bronchoscopy with BAL and brushings \ncan be used to diagnose TB. Transbronchial biopsy can \nalso be performed and is recommended in the following \npatients: \na. Patients unable to induce sputum \nb. Patients with suspected miliary TB who are either \nunable to induce sputum or in whom the sputum \nis negative. Brushings and transbronchial biopsy are \nrecommended in these patients. \n7. Tuberculous pleurisy with effusion \na.

Isolation: see above \nB. Principles of therapy \n1. Goals include clinical cure of the patient, halting disease \ntransmission and preventing drug resistance to therapy. \n2. Drug-resistant TB is a significant problem. MDR-TB refers \nto resistance to isoniazid and rifampin with an estimated \n\n196 I CHAPTER 10 \n500,000 cases worldwide. Extensively drug-resistant TB \n(XDR-TB) refers to resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, \nfluoroquinolone and 1 of 3 second-line drugs (ami.kacin, \nkanamycin, or capreomycin). \n3. Precise drug recommendations evolve due to resistance. \n4. Susceptibility testing is critical to ensure an appropriate \nregimen is used. \n5. Direct observed therapy (DOT) \na. Premature discontinuation and nonaclherence promote \ndrug resistance and must be avoided. \nb. DOT refers to treatment protocols where public health \nofficials directly observe patients swalloeach dose of \nmedication {administered 2-3 times/week). \nc. DOT is strongly recommended and the standard of \npractice in the United States. \n6. Due ro the public health risks ofMDR-TB, the responsibility \nfor prescribing appropriate therapy and ensuring adherence \nrests on the public health program and clinician. \n7. Effective regimens require at least 2 drugs to which the \norganism is susceptible. \n8. Effective therapy takes many months. \n9. All patients should be seen monthly to assess symptoms, \nside effects, and adherence to therapy. \n10. TB therapy in HIV-infected patients is complex due to \ninnumerable drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy \nand the need for differing regimens depending on the degree \nof immunosuppression. \nC. MDR-TB \n1. Defined when organisms are resistant to isoniazid and \nrifampin \n2. Accounts for 3.7% of necases and 20% of previously \ntreated cases worldwide. \na. 60% of cases ofMDR-TB worldwide are in India. \nChina, and Russia. \nb. In some countries, the rate ofMDR-TB among ne\ncases is 9-32% and > 50% in those previously treated. \n3. Suspect MDR-TB in patients previously treated for TB, in \npatients who are HIV positive, in close contacts of patients with \nMDR-TB, and in patients who have not responded to therapy. \n4. 9% ofMDR-TB cases haveXDR-TB. \n5. DOT should be used for patients with MDR-TB. \n6. Surgery is occasionally used for patients with localized \ndisease and persistently positive sputums. Antituberculous \ntherapy is continued. \nD. Treatment of active pulmonary TB in patients at lorisk for \nMDR-TB \n1. Obtain baseline liver biochemical tests, CBC, basic \nmetabolic panel, and uric acid. HIV testing is \nrecommended. Tests for hepatitis B and C should be \nobtained in high-risk groups or patients with abnormal \nbaseline liver biochemical tests. Ophthalmology evaluation \nis recommended for patients receiving ethambutol. \n2. A rapid molecular test for drug resistance is recommended \nin patients at risk for drug resistance (see above). \n3. Treat for 2 months with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, \nand ethambutol and then simplify the regimen to isoniazid \nand rifampin, if the organism is fully susceptible, for an \nadditional 4 months. Ethambutol can be discontinued earlier \nif the organism is susceptible to both isoniazid and rifampin. \n4. Empiric therapy (prior to the results of microscopy, NAAT-\nand culture), should also be started in patients with a high \nlikelihood ofTB and those seriously ill with suspected TB. \nTherapy can then be continued or stopped depending on \ntest results (Figure 10-7). \nS. More aggressive therapy is required for patients with \ncavitaryTB. \n6. Obtain follow-up liver biochemical tests in symptomatic \npatients and those at high risk for isoniazid hepatotoxicity, \nincluding patients with risk factors for hepatitis (eg, alcohol \nconsumption, pregnancy or postpartum, HIV-infection, \nchronic liver disease, or other hepatotoxic medications) and \npatients receiving pyrazinamide after the first 2 months. \n7. Visual acuity and color discrimination tests are \nrecommended at baseline and monthly during ethambutol \nuse to detect optic neuritis. \n8. See Chapter 5 for recommendations in HIV-infected persons. \n9. The median duration of fever after the institution of \nantituberculous drugs was 10 days but ranged from 1 to \n109 days. For patients with tuberculous effusion, resorption \ncan take 4 months. \nE. Pleural fluid drainage does not improve outcome in patients \nwith tuberculous effusions (nonempyema). \nF. Treatment of latent TB \n1. Expen consultation is recommended if exposure to drug-\nresistant TB is likely. \n2. Isoniazid is the most commonly used treatment option; \nrifampin for 4 months has recently been shown to be \nnoninferior. \n3. Isoniazid \na. Dose is 300 mg/day for 9 months or 900 mg twice a \nweek with DOT. \nb. Reduces subsequent development of active TB from \n14.3% to 3.6% in individuals with radiographic \nevidence of healed TB. \nc. Side effects include hepatitis (0.1- 2.3%) and \nneuropathy (2%). Neuropathy can be prevented with \npyridoxine (25-50 mg/day). Advised for pregnant or \nbreastfeeding women, HIV-infected persons and those \nwith diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, malnutrition, or \nchronic kidney failure taking isoniazid. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nUnfortunately, Mr. P's HIV result was positive; his CD4 count \nwas 100 cells/mcL, and PJP was strongly suspected. His \nPPD and AFB smears were negative. Sputum silver stain for \nPJP was negative and the following day he underwent 17ron-\nchoscopY. The sliver sUiln from the BAL confirmed PJP. and \ntreatment with t rlmethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and corti-\ncosteroids was continued. \nOn day 3 of his hospitalization, he became agitated, \ntachycardlc, and complained ofvlsual hallucinations. He was \ntreated for delirium tremens with high doses of IV benzodi-\nazepines (see Chapter 11 ). By day 5, he was improving. He \nwas afel7rlle and his appetite Improved. Ant iretroviral ther-\napY was started and t he PJP regimen was continued. \n\nPatients with a history of alcohol abuse must \nbe monitored for withdrawal during any \nhospitalization. \nConsider PJP in patients with pneumonia and \ndiffuse bilateral infiltrates, even in patients \nwithout known HIV or risk factors. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nHospital-acquired Pneumonia and Ventilator-\nassociated Pneumonia \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with hospital-acquired pneumonia present similarly to \npatients with CAP although they are often sicker due to a combination \nof greater comorbidities and an increased likelihood of coloni7.ation \nand infection with virulent pathogens. Those with hospital-acquired \npneumonia may be recovering from surgery when fever or ddirium \nheralds the devdopment of hospital-acquired pneumonia. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is defined as pneumonia that \ndevdops ~ 48 hours after hospital admission. \nB. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is defined as pneumonia that \ndevelops ~ 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. \nC. Pneumonia in such patients is often secondary to multidrug-\nresistant organisms, including MRSA and gram-negative \nbacilli including P aeruginosa. They may also be infected with \norganisms that commonly cause CAP (S pneumoniae and \nH injlumzae). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of pneumonia is typically made clinically by the \npresence of a nelung inf'tltrate and ~ 2 of the following: fever \n> 38C, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and purulent secretions. \nB. A lower respiratory tract culture is recommended. Samples \nmay include expectorated sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or \nsamples &om bronchoscopy (BAL or protected brush speci-\nmen). Endotracheal aspirate is preferred in ventilated patients \nand sputum culture in nonventilated patients. \nC. Blood cultures are recommended for patients with hospital-\nacquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. \nTreatment \nA. Antimicrobial coverage is designed to cover S aureus, P aerug-\ninosa, and other gram-negative bacteria. \nB. The 2016 IDSA guidelines recommend coverage of S aureus, \nP aeruginosa, and gram-negative bacilli for all patients with \nhospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneu-\nmonia. Extended coverage should be given to patients with an \nincreased risk for antibiotic resistance or at an increased risk \nof death. \n1. An increased risk of resistance should be assumed in areas \nwith a > 10-20% local resistance on antibiogram, in \npatients receiving antibiotics within the preceding 90 days, \nand those hospitalized for ~ 5 days prior to pneumonia. \n2. An increased risk of mortality should be assumed for \npatients with septic shock, those requiring ventilator \nsuppon, or new-onset renal replacement therapy. \nCOUGH, FEVER, AND RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS I 197 \n3. Extended coverage includes vancomycin or line'LOlid \nfor possible MRSA infection and 2 antipseudomonal \nantibiotics. \n4. Aerosolized antibiotics in addition to IV antibiotics may be \nuseful in select patients. \n5. Culture data and susceptibility should guide antimicrobial \ntherapy when it becomes available. \nPertussis \nTextbook Presentation \nThe typical adult with penussis presents with \"viral type\" upper \nrespiratory infection symptoms of nonproductive cough, rhinor-\nrhea, sore throat, and sneezing. However, instead of resolving over \n3-7 days, the cough persists and is paroxysmal, often severe and \noccasionally even terminates in posttussive emesis. Whooping, a \ndeep inspiration at the end of a cough, is unusual in adults. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The average incubation period is 7-10 days but may be 28 \ndays or longer. \nB. Half of pertussis cases occur in adolescents and adults. \nC. Spread by aerosol droplets. Devdops in about one-third of \nhousehold contacts. \nD. Typically occurs in 3 stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and chronic. \nI. Catarrhal stage lasts 1-2 weeks. \na. Typical symptoms include rhinitis, lacrimation, sore \nthroat, coughing, and sneezing. \nb. The cough is usually mild. \nc. Fever is absent or lograde. \n2. Paroxysmal phase begins in the second week with fits of \n5-10 or more forceful coughs {paroxysms) in an otherwise \nwdl-appearing patient. \na. A deep inspiration may occur at the end of coughing \n(the \"whoop\"). \nb. Emesis may occur at the end of coughing. \nc. Can last 2-3 months (the chronic phase). \nd. The cough may be severe and prevent sleeping. \ne. Unusual complications from coughing in adults include \nhernia, pneumothorax, rib fracture, and weight loss. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Among patients with cough lasting> 6-7 days, the prevalence \nof pertussis is 3-20%; however, the likelihood increases in \nadult patients with acute cough lasting> 3 weeks (12-32%}. \nB. The median duration of cough is 42 days (27-66 days). \nC. Clinical symptoms \n1. Absence of paroxysms or posttussive gagging makes \npertussis unlikdy. \na. Paroxysmal cough: Sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 12%; \nLR+, 1.1; LR-, O \nb. Posttussive gagging: Sensitivity, 100%; specificity, \n28.7%; LR+, 1.4; LR-, 0 \n2. No symptom is terribly specific or diagnostic. \na. Whooping: sensitivity, 26%; specificity, 85.4%; LR+, \n1.8; LR-, 0.9 \nb. Posttussive emesis: sensitivity, 56%; specificity, 68%; \nLR+, 1.7; LR-, 0.65 \n\n198 I CHAPTER 10 \n3. Productive cough makes pertussis unlikdy (occurs in 3% of \npatients with pertussis). \n~ \nPertussis is unlikely in patients with productive \ny \ncoughs. \n4. Other common causes of persistent cough include other \ninfections, therapy with an ACE inhibitor, gastroesophageal \nreflux disease, asthma, and allergic cough. \nS. Testing options include culture, PCR, and serology. \na. Culture is 30-60% sensitive, 100% specific, and takes \n7-10 days. \nb. For patients with symptoms of 2--4 weeks, culture and \nPCR are recommended. \nc. For patients with symptoms > 4 weeks, serology is \nrecommended (diagnosis is confirmed with a 4-fold change \nin titer or an IgG anti-PT level;?: 100-125 EU/mL). \nTreatment \nA. Vaccination \n1. Childhood vaccination diminishes over 5-10 years and is \nrardy effective for more than 12 years. \n2. ACIP recommends a single TDAP vaccination for all adults. \nB. Treatment \n1. Treatment usually started during the paroxysmal phase. \na. Probably does not affect the course of illness \nb. Decreases spread to others. Without postexposure \nprophylaxis, the secondary attack rate is > 80% among \nsusceptible persons. \nc. Infected patients should avoid contact with young \nchildren and infants and working in healthcare fucilities \nfor at least 5 days after starting antibiotics. \n2. Azithromydn and clarithromydn are drugs of choice. \n3. Postexposure prophylaxis recommended for people in close \ncontacts with pertussis regardless of the immunization status. \nREFERENCES \nBurk M, El-Kcnh K, Saad M, Wiemla:n T, Ramirez J, Cavallazzi R.

On morning rounds, he comments that \nhe ls In a military barracks and that he Is ready to go home. \n~~ What le the dlffeNJntial diagnal!ill!i of delirium \n~Jill\"' and dementia? Hawould you frame the \ndlffeNJntia11 \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nDelirium and dementia are both syndromes of neurologic dysfunc-\ntion that present as a \"change in mental status.\" Since the term \n\"altered mental status\" can be broad, categorizing the change as \nchronic or acute and then further classifying acute changes as fluo-\ntuating or nonfluctuating may be helpful (Figure 11-1). A patient \nwhose mental status change is acute may have either fluctuating \nor nonfluctuating symptoms. A patient with acute, fluctuating \nmental status change is probably delirious. A patient with an acute \nbut stable mental status change may have delirium but may also \nhave a long list of other central nervous system (CNS) insults (head \ntrauma, CNS infection, hypoglycemia, cerebrovascular accident \n[CVA] among others). Chronic mental change is caused by an irre-\nversible change to the CNS, such as dementia, chronic psychiatric \ndisease, or long-standing CNS injury. \nDelirium and dementia are thus very different syndromes. \nDelirium is acute, usually reversible, and nearly always has an \nunderlying, non-neurologic etiology. Dementia is chronic and sel-\ndom reversible. The definition of delirium from the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorden, Se (DSM-5) is: \nA. A disturbance in attention (ie, reduced ability to direct, focus, \nsustain, and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orienta-\ntion to the environment). \nB. The disturbance develops over a short period of time, rep-\nresents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and \ntends to fluctuate in severity during the course of a day. \nC. An additional disturbance in cognition (eg, memory deficit, \ndisorientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception}. \nD. The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained \nby another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive \ndisorder and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced \nlevel of arousal, such as coma. \nE. There is evidence from the history, physical exam, or labo-\nratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiologic \nconsequence of another medical condition, substance intoxica-\ntion or withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multi-\nple etiologies. \nThe DSM-5 defines dementia as a major neurocognitive disor-\nder and then defines the many underlying diseases. The definition \nof a major cognitive disorder is: \nA. Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level \nof performance in 1 or more cognitive domains (complex \nattention, executive function, learning and memory, language, \nperceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on: \nI. Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, \nor the clinician that there has been a significant decline in \ncognitive function; and \n2. A substantial impairment in cognitive performance, \npreferably documented by standardized neuropsychological \ntesting or, in its absence, another quantified clinical \nassessment. \nB. The cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday \nactivities (ie, at a minimum, requiring assistance with complex \ninstrumental activities of daily living [IADLs] such as paying \nbills or managing medications). \nC. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context \nof a delirium. \nD. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by \nanother mental disorder {eg, major depressive disorder, \nschizophrenia). \nBecause almost any illness can cause delirium in a susceptible \npatient, the differential diagnosis of ddirium is long and needs to \nconsider a broad range of illnesses, comorbidities, and medication \neffects. The differential diagnosis of dementia is more finite. Dis-\norders have been listed in order of their approximate prevalence as \netiologic factors. \nA. Ddirium \nI. Metabolic \na. Dehydration \nb.

His surgery was complicated by transient \nhyPOtension and excessive blood loss. He was extubated \non postoperative day 3. On postoperative day 4, his wife \nnoted some confusion. The med lcal team did not detect any \nabnormalities when t hey evaluated him. \nToday, postoperat ive day 5, he Is more confused. He Is \noriented only to person. He is unable to answer any mlni-\nmally complicated questions. \nAt thie point, what ie the leading hypotheeie, \nwhat ans the active alternatlvn, and le thens a \nmuet not ml55 dlagnoele1 Given thle dtffensntlal \ndlagno51e, what tnt5 should l7e ordensd.1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nBased on his history, Mr. B's acute mental status change appears to \nfulftll the definition of delirium. He has waxing and waning symp-\ntoms, disorientation and inattentiveness. All of these are pivotal \n\npoints in this case. His postoperative state, recent exposure to seda-\ntives and pain medications (anesthesia), and fluid shifts are all poten-\ntial causes of delirium. Although Mr. B does not have a history of \nalcohol abuse, alcohol withdrawal is always a possible diagnosis for \nacute mental status change in the hospital and is a \"must not miss\" \ndiagnosis. Stroke and seizure, although commonly considered in the \ndifferential diagnosis of mental status change, arc exceedingly rare \ncauses of ddirium. Table 11-1 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nOn physical exam, Mr. B is lying in bed. He is irritable and \nagitated. He becomes frustrated during questioning. His \nvital signs are temperature, 37.0\"C; BP. 146/90 mm Hg; \npulse, 00 bpm; RR, 18 breaths per minute. General physical \nexam reveals a healing surgical scar; lung, heart, and abdom-\ninal exams are nomal. On neurologlc exam, his Confusion \nAssessment Method score is 3 out of 4 (see below). The \nremainder of the neurologic exam is normal. \nlnttial laboratory data, including basic metabolic panel, \nllver biochemical tests, and urinalysis, are normal. \n~ \nle the c::linlcal information &ufflc::ient to make a \n1~Jll\"' diagnoeie1 If not, what other information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Delirium \nTatbook Presentation \nDelirium commonly manifests as inattention and confusion. It is \nusually seen in older patients with severe illness. Clouding of con-\nsciousness has classically been used to describe a patient's symptoms. \nTable 11-1.

Almost any illness can lead to delirium in a susceptible patient. \nB. Delirium often complicates medical or surgical hospitalizations. \nC. The most important clues to delirium are the acuity of onset \nand the fluctuation of course. \nD. Delirium most commonly occurs in older persons and in \npatients with underlying neurologic disease. \n~ \nThere is always a cause of delirium. Clinicians \ny \nmust recognitt delirium and identify the cause. \nE. Several conditions arc more likely to cause delirium than others. \n1. Severe illness \n2. Drug toxicity \n3. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia and \nazotentla) \n4. Infections \nS. Hypothermia or hyperthermia \nF. Delirium is very common in sick, hospitalittd patients over \nthe age of65. \n1. 10% of emergency department patients \n2. 12-25% of medical patients \n3. 20-50% of surgical patients (highest in patients after hip \nreplacement) \nMost acutely ill, older patients who have an \nacute deterioration in mental status are suffer-\ning from delirium. \nG. The prognosis of delirium is poor. \n1. Although reliable data is difficult to obtain, delirium is a \npredictor of poor outcomes. \n2. Meta-analysis shows that, after controlling for age, sex, \ncomorbid illness or illness severity, and baseline dementia, \npatients who experienced ddirium had a higher risk of death, \ninstitutionalization, and dementia during follow-up. \na. The mortality rate, over about 2 years, for patients in \nwhom delirium devdoped was 38%. \nb. The rate of institutionalization, over about a year, was \n33.4%. \nc. The rate of developing dementia over the next 4 years \nwas 62.5%. \n3. In this same study, patients with dementia and delirium \nhad the highest risk of death. \nH. Delirium is often persistent. Many studies shothat most \npatients in whom delirium devdops have at least some persis-\ntent symptoms at discharge. These symptoms may be present \nfor months. \nOnly a small percentage of patients with delir-\nium have complete resolution of symptoms \nwith treatment of the underlying disease and \nreturn home. \nI. Delirium can occasionally \"unmask\" underlying dementia. \nThis occurs when a patient with a mild, undiagnosed demen-\ntia becomes delirious in the hospital and is then evaluated \nmore fully for cognitive impairment. \n\n204 I CHAPTER 1 1 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA. Pretest probability \n1. Predictors of delirium have been identified. These help \nprovide pretest probabilities. \n2. One study developed a model to determine a patient's risk of \ndelirium developing while in the hospital. Predictors included: \na. Vision impairment \nb. Severe illness \nc. Cognitive impairment \nd. High blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio \n3. In a patient population with a mean age of78, the number \nof risk factors present correlated with the risk of developing \ndelirium. \na. No risk factors: 3% chance of delirium developing. \nb. 1 or 2 risk factors: 14% chance of delirium developing. \nc. 3 or 4 risk factors: 26% chance of delirium developing. \n4. Several predictors from another study, with ORs for \nassociation with delirium, are listed below: \na. Abnormal sodium level (OR 6.2) \nb. Severe illness (OR 5.9) \nc. Chronic cognitive impairment (OR 5.3) \nd. Hypothermia or hyperthermia (OR 5.0) \ne. Moderate illness (OR 4.0) \nf. Psychoactive drug use (OR 3.9) \ng. Azotemia (OR 2.9) \nB. Diagnosis \nConsider a patient's risk of delirium upon \nhospital admission; an accurate identification \nof risk can prompt intervention to lessen the \nlikelihood of delirium and allomore rapid \nintervention if delirium does occur. \n1. In general, a routine exam is specific but insensitive for the \ndiagnosis of delirium. \n2. Multiple tools have been developed to diagnose delirium. \n3. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is the best-\nvalidated and most widely used tool for diagnosing \ndelirium. \n4. The CAM is considered positive when a patient fulfills \nboth criteria a and b as well as either c or d: \na. The mental status change is of acute onset and \nfluctuating course. \nb. There is inattention. The patient has difficulty focusing \nhis attention (being easily distracted or having trouble \nfollowing a conversation}. \nc. There is disorganized thinking. The patient's thinking \nis disorganized or incoherent (such as rambling or \nirrelevant conversation, unclear or illogical floof ideas, \nor unpredictable switching from subject to subject). \nd. There is an altered level of consciousness. This can be \nanything other than alert (vigilant, lethargic, stuporous). \n5. The test characteristics for the CAM are good and surpass \nthose of an unaided physician assessment. \na. CAM: sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 93%; LR+, 12.3; \nLR-, 0.15. \nb. Physician evaluation (in the emergency department): \nsensitivity, 17-35%; specificity, 98-100; LR+, 8.5-oo; \nLR-, 0.65-0.85. \n6. The CAM-Sis a validated tool, based on CAM, to assess \nthe severity of the diagnosed delirium. \na. There are 4- and 10-item versions of the CAM-S; the \nhigher the score, the more severe the delirium. \nb. Increasing scores predict longer hospital length of stay, \nworse functional decline, and higher 90-day mortality. \nC. Etiology \nI. Because delirium is a symptom and not a disease, once a \ndiagnosis of delirium is made, it is necessary to identify the \ncause. \n2. The initial evaluation of the patient involves a revieof the \nmost common causes of delirium. \na. Repeat a physical exam, focusing on sources of infection. \nb. Reviemedications in detail, including reconciling \nhome and hospital medications. \nMedication toxicity, even at therapeutic doses, \nis a common cause of delirium, particularly \ncommon in older patients. Revieall medica-\ntions, especially psychoactive ones. \nc. Always order basic laboratory tests, such as a complete \nblood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel, liver \nbiochemical tests, and urinalysis. \nd. Consider other tests (based on the clinical situation) \nsuch as ECG, chest radiograph, pulse oximetry (with \narterial blood gas [ABG] if the patient is at risk for C02 \nretention), and blood and urine cultures. \n3. Uncommon causes \na. If the initial workup is negative, is it usually reasonable \nto assume that the delirium is related to the acute \nillness? Evaluation for diseases that directly affect the \nCNS (eg, stroke, seizure, and meningitis or encephalitis) \nis seldom necessary. \n(I) Stroke \n(a) Very rare cause of delirium \n(b) A robust study reported that only about 7% of \ncases of delirium are caused by stroke. \n(c) 97% of these patients had focal abnormalities \non a careful neurologic exam. \n(2) Seizure \n(a) Nonconvulsive seizures, such as temporal \nlobe epilepsy, are usually recognized by their \nintermittent nature. \n(b) Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is very rare \nbut is a potential cause of mental status change \nthat could be confused with delirium. Patients \nwith nonconvulsive status epilepticus almost \nalways have risk factors for seizures or abnormal \neye movements (eye jerking, hippus, repeated \nblinking, persistent eye deviation). \n(3) Meningitis: Fever and mental status change may be \nthe only presenting symptoms. \nb. When evaluating a delirious patient, consider \nneuroimaging, EEG, and lumbar puncture only in \ncertain conditions. \n(1) Neu.roimaging is only necessary if delirium is \nassociated with a focal neurologic exam or if there is \na very high suspicion of a cerebrovascular event. \n(2) EEG is only necessary if there is no other \nexplanation for delirium and the patient has risk \nfactors for or signs of seizures. \n\n(3) Lumbar puncture is only necessary if there is \nfever with no other source or suspicion fur a CNS \ninfection. \nTreatment \nA. Prevention \n1. Because of its poor prognosis, delirium should be prevented \nwhen possible. \n2. Multidisciplinary interventions have been shown to prevent \ndelirium. One srudy demonstrated a decrease in the rate of \ndelirium from 15% to 9.9% (number needed to treat= 20). \n3. The National Institute fur Health and Clinic:al Excellence \npublished a guideline fur the prevention of delirium. \nAmong the 13 recommendations were: \na. Addressing cognitive impairment (suc:h as providing \nstimuli to reorient patients) \nb. Paying attention to hydration status, constipation, and \nhypoxia \nc. Focusing on preventing, identifying, and treating \ninfection \nd. Encouraging early mobility \ne. Addressing sensory impairments (use of glasses and \nhearing aids, cerumen disimpaction) \nf. Promoting good sleep patterns/sleep hygiene \nB. Treatment \nOnce delirium occurs, the causes must be addressed and \nsupportive measures must be instituted. \n1. Administer fluids to treat and prevent dehydration. \n2. Avoid sleep deprivation. \n3. Provide a quiet environment. \n4. Keep nighttime awakenings to a minimum. \n5. Protect &om falls or self-inflicted injury. \na. \"Sitters\" are preferable to restraints as the latter can \nincrease the risk of ph}'llical injury. \nb. Sitters can also provide constant reorientation and \nreassurance. \nc. Occasionally, medications suc:h as lodoses of \nneuroleptics can be used fur sedation. Long-term use \nshould be avoided whenever possible. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nRevieof Mr. B's medication list revealed that lorazepam \n(0.5 mg) was being given every 8 hours Instead of as \nneeded. Laboratory data was normal with the exception of \nan ABG: 7.36/46/80. \n0 hours \n12 hours \n24 hours \nDELIRIUM AND DEMENTIA I 205 \nHave you cros5Bd a dlagnoetlc threshold \nfor the leading hypotheel9, delfrlum1 Have \nyou ruled out the active alternatlves1 Do \nother teete need to be done to e>eelude the \nalternative dlagnoeee1 \nBy CAM criteria, Mr. B is delirious. He has recently undergone a \nmajor surgery and he is taking medications known to cause delir-\nium. Despite his intraoperative blood loss and hypotension, there \nare no signs of a stroke, cardiac: isc:hemia, heart failure, or anemia. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Alcohol Withdrawal \nTextbook Presentation \nA typical presentation of alcohol withdrawal in the inpatient set-\nting is agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia occ:urring during \nthe first 2 da}'ll after hospital admission. Seizures may soon follo\nwith delusions and delirium occ:urring during the first 3-5 da)'ll. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are stereotypical, occurring \non a predictable timeline as outlined in Figure 11-2. \nB. The predominant symptoms of minor withdrawal are irritability, \nhypertension, and tac:hyc:ardia. \nC. Alcoholic: hallucinosis \n1. Syndrome of hallucinations (usually visual) \n2. Patients with alcoholic hallucinosis usually have a clear \nsensorium (ie, they would perform well on CAM). \nThis fact usually makes alcoholic hallucinosis easily \ndistinguishable from delirium. \nD. Major withdrawal is synonymous with delirium tremens. \n1. Occurs in patients with history of severe alcohol abuse. \n2. Confusion, disorientation, and autonomic: hyperactivity are \nhallmarks. \n3. Delirium tremens can be fatal if not appropriately treated. \nE. Wernicke encephalopathy \n1. Wernicke encephalopathy is not an alcohol withdrawal \nsyndrome but is caused by thiamine deficiency. \n2. Alcohol abuse is the most common cause of thiamine \ndeficiency. \n3. Wernicke encephalopathy may occ:ur when a patient, who \nis thiamine deficient, receives intravenous glucose. \n4. Symptoms include the triad of confusion, disorders of \nocular movement, and ataxia. The confusion commonly \nmanifests as disorientation and indifference. \n5. Korsakoff syndrome is the chronic form of Wernicke \nencephalopathy. Korsakoff syndrome presents with \nmemory problems and resulting confabulation. \n36 hours \n48 hours \n\"\"\"1 ... ------Seizures -------i~.il \n------- Minor withdrawal -------1..i \nI,. \nAlcohol hallucinosis --------\n1... \nMajor withdrawal ------\nFigure 11-:Z. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal by hour interval. \n\n206 I CHAPTER 1 1 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA. Delirium tremens and Wernicke encephalopathy are the \nalcohol-related syndromes most likely to be confused with \nnonalcohol-related delirium. Various features clearly differen-\ntiate these syndromes. \nB. Wernicke encephalopathy \n1. This is generally noted in patients with long-term alcohol \nabuse. (Cases ofWernicke encephalopathy have also \noccurred in association with hyperemesis gravidarum \nand following bariatric surgery). \n2. It is imponant to recognize that Wernicke encephalopathy \nusually presents with only 1 or 2 of the features of the \nclassic triad. \n3. Fluctuation that characterizes nonalcohol-related delirium \nis absent. \n4. The diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy can be made if \n2 of the following 4 signs are present; \na. Dietary deficiencies (as evidenced by underweight, \nthiamine deficiency, or abnormal dietary history) \nb. Disorders of ocular movement (such as ophthalmoplegia, \nnystagmus or gaze palsy) \nc. Cerebellar signs \nd. Altered mental state or memory impairment \nS. Wernicke encephalopathy is a difficult diagnosis to make in \nthe setting of hepatic encephalopathy. \n6. There are specific MRI findings that are seen in Wernicke \nencephalopathy. \nC. Delirium tremens \n1. Always preceded by minor withdrawal. \n2. Minor withdrawal can be overlooked in the hospital if a \npatient is critically ill, sedated, or anesthetized. \n3. History of heavy alcohol use required. \n4. Adrenergic overactivity (hypenension, tachycardia, fever) \nis always present unless masked by medications. \nTreatment \nEvery patient should have an alcohol history \ntaken on admission. If a clinical syndrome \nsuggestive of alcohol withdrawal occurs in a \npatient who denied alcohol use, information \nabout alcohol use should be sought from other \nsources. \nA. Both Wernicke encephalopathy and delirium tremens are \npreventable. \nB. Wernicke encephalopathy \n1. Any patient in whom thiamine deficiency is suspected \nshould receive 100 mg of IV thiamine prior to receiving \nglucose-containing fluids. \n2. Patients in whom Wernicke encephalopathy is suspected \nshould receive thiamine until symptoms resolve. \nC. Alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens \n1. Supponive care \n2. Benzodiazepines \na. Benzodiazepines decrease the symptoms of withdrawal \nand can prevent delirium tremens, seizures, and death. \nb. Some patients can be treated for alcohol withdrawal \nwith benzodiazepines as outpatients. \nc. Indications for inpatient therapy \n(1) Moderate to severe withdrawal \n(2) Prior history of seizures or delirium tremens \n(3) Patient unable to cooperate with outpatient therapy \n(4) Comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions \n(5) Unsuccessful outpatient detoxification \nd. Inpatient management \n(1) The optimal dose ofbenzodiazepines cannot be \ndetermined in advance and must be titrated to the \nparticular needs of the patient. \n(2) Benzodiazepines may either be given on a fixed-\nscheduled or be given to treat symptoms. Both \nstrategies require careful patient monitoring and \nmedication adjustment. \n(3) The Addiction Research Foundation Clinical \nInstitute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol \n(CIWA-Ar) developed a tool to predict the level of \nalcohol withdrawal. \n(a) The tool scores the severity of symptoms in \nvarious categories such as tremor, anxiety, and \nsensory disturbances. \n(b) A higher score(> 8-12) generally calls for active \npharmacologic management, whether using a \nfixed-dose or symptom-triggered protocol. \n(c) Printable versions of the tool are available online. \n(4) Fixed-schedule therapy \n(a) Delivers regular fixed doses of benzodiazepines. \n(b) Careful monitoring is still required to avoid \nundertteatment or oversedation. \n(c) Fixed-schedule therapy may provide a slight \nmargin of safety if careful monitoring cannot be \nperformed adequately. \n(S) Symptom-triggered therapy \n(a) Avoids unnecessary medications in the group of \npatients who will not need them. \n(b) Careful monitoring is required to avoid \nwithdrawal and delirium tremens. \nCareful monitoring and prompt patient-specific \nadjustment of benzodiazepine dose is the key to \nsuccessful management of the alcoholic patient. \n3. Beta-blockers \na. Can decrease sympathetic overactivity in patients during \nwithdrawal. \nb. Are useful adjuncts but, because they can mask \nsympathetic signs that alert the clinician to increasingly \nsevere withdrawal, they increase the risk of inadequate \nuse ofbenzodiazepines. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nOn the afternoon of the flfih post operative day. Mr. B \npulled out his IV and attempted to climb out of bed while \nhis chest tube was still attached. Around t he clock obser-\nvation was ordered. \nFurther history revealed no history of alcohol use. \nMr. B was placed on oxygen with near normalization of his \nblood gas. Lorazepam was di5COntlnued. By postoperative \n\nday 8 (3 days after the onset of his dellrium) Mr. B's mental \nstatus had returned nearly to baseline. He was stlll occa-\nsionally disoriented to time. \nHe was discharged on postoperative day 14. His wife \nnoted him to still be occasionally \"spacey\" at the time of \ndischarge. The patient was completely back to normal at a \npostoperative visit 14 days later. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. R is a 70-year-old man who comes to see you in clinic \naccompanied by his wife because she is concerned that his \nmemory ls getting worse. She states that for the last fe\nmonths he has been getting lost driving 20 miles from his \nhome to his local VA hospital, where he volunteers. He has \ndone this Job twice a week for 2 5 years. \n~ \nAt this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \n1~r what are the active alternativH, and le there a \nmust not mlu diagnosis? Given this differential \ndiagnosis, what tests should be ordensd1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. R has had a decline in cognitive status. He has lost the \nability to do a higher-level task. Given the patient's advanced age, \ndementia-most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD)-has to be \nincluded in the differential diagnosis of his cognitive decline. The \nsubacute onset of this patient's symptoms makes AD the leading \nhypothesis. Another common cause of dementia in older persons \nis vascular dementia (VaD). It will be imponant to determine \nwhether this patient has risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. In \nan older person, clinicians should also consider the normal cog-\nnitive decline that comes with aging. However, this never causes \nfunctional compromise. An alternative diagnosis is mild cognitive \nimpairment (MCI), a syndrome of memory loss more severe than \nnormal, age-related cognitive decline. MCI also does not cause \nfunctional impairment. Delirium and depression should always be \nconsidered in an older patient with cognitive decline because they \nare highly treatable. Table 11-2 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nA patient who is unable to successfully live \nindependently because of cognitive issues \nalways has an abnormality. \nMr. R's past medical history is notable for chronic leg pain \nresulting from an Injury during the war In Vietnam. He also has \ngout. Mr. R Is a retired accountant. He completed 4 years of \ncollege. His physic.al exam reveals an alert, pleasant man. \nHis medications are \n1. Paroxetfne, 20 mg dally \n2. Methadone, 20 mg 3 times daily \nDELIRIUM AND DEMENTIA I 207 \nThe patient's delirium was severe for 3-4 days and persisted for at \nleast 1 week. The delirium was assumed to be a symptom of the \npostsurgical state and a medication complication. No specific ther-\napy was given. The patient's safety was ensured with a \"sittern and \nthe reversible factors were addressed. \n3. Meloxicam, 7.5 mg daily \n4. Acetaminophen with codeine (300/6 0), 2 tablets \n3tlmesda!ly \n5. Allopurlnol, 300 mg dally \nOn examination, his vit al signs are normal. He answers \nabout half the history questions himself but turns to his \nwife for assistance with detalls about doctors he has seen \nand the medications he takes. He and his wife deny any \nsymptoms of depression, although t hey note this has been \na problem in the past. He has taken paroxetine for years. \nHis physical exam is normal except for evidence of bilat-\neral knee osteoarthritis. Except for his mental status, his \ninitial neurologic exam, including motor, sensory. and reflex \nexamination, Is normal. \n~ \nle the clinical Information eufflclent to make a \n1~r diagnosis?

The patient may \ndeny that a problem exists. Detection of dementia during casual \nconversation may he difficult early in its course; more formal \nassessment is frequently necessary. \nDisease Highlights \nA. AD most commonly occurs after the age of 65, although earlier \npresentations are possible. \nB. Memory loss, behavioral or personality change, functional \nimpairments, and social withdrawal are common early symptoms \nof AD. \nC. Language disturbances \n1. In addition to those listed above, language dismrbances are \noften present early in the course of the disease and often \nbecome severe with time. \n2. Language disturbances may include fluent aphasia, paraphasia, \nand word substitutions. \nD. Later in the course of the disease, global cognitive impairment \ndevelops, and patients become unable to independently \naccomplish the most basic activities of daily living (ADLs). \nAlthough present, memory loss may not he \nthe presenting symptom in patients with AD; \nrather, behavioral or personality changes, \nfunctional impairments, social withdrawal, \nor language disturbances may be the initial \nsymptoms. \nE. AD accounts for about 67% of cases of dementia. \nF. Strictly speaking, the diagnosis of AD can only he made \npathologically. That said, the diagnosis of AD is alwa}'ll made \nclinically. \nG. All definitions of AD include the deterioration in a person's \nability to function independently. A patient's level of function-\ning can be evaluated by assessing her ability to do the IADLs. \n1. IADLs include \na. Cooking \nb. House cleaning \nc. Laundry \nd. Management of medications \ne. Management of the telephone \nf. Management of personal accounts \ng. Shopping \nh. Use of transportation \n2. Late in the disease, a patient's ability to perform the ADLs \noften becomes compromised. These ADLs are \na. Bathing \nb. Eating \nc. Walking \nd. Toileting and continence \ne. Dressing \nf. Grooming \nH. The prognosis of AD is poor. \n1. Estimates of median survival have traditionally ranged from \n5 years to 9 years with more recent data suggesting median \nsurvival close to 3 years with a range of2.7 to 4 years. \n2. Patients with advanced dementia do especially poorly. In \n1 cohort of patients with advanced dementia who were \nmonitored for 18 months, 54.8% died, 41.1 % developed \npneumonia, and 85.8% developed an eating problem. \n3. Patients with AD also have a much worse prognosis after \nan acute illness. In the same cohort, the 6-month mortality \nrate for patients who had pneumonia was 46.7%. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosing AD can be challenging because patients often have \nsubtle symptoms early in the disease course. \n1. AD presents with self-reported memory loss in only a \nminority of patients. \na. Memory loss reported by a spouse, relative, or close \nfriend is more predictive of dementia than self-reported \nmemory loss. \nb. Memory loss reported by a patient is still predictive \ndementia hut may also be a sign of depression. \n2. Behavioral changes and mood changes are commonly \nrecognized by family members. \n3. Clinicians may recognize behavioral changes such as \nincreased anxiety, increased somatic complaints, or \ndelusional thinking regarding illness as early symptoms of \nthe disease. \nBe aware that AD should be on the differential \ndi~osis of subtle hehavioral changes in older \npatients. \nB. The most efficient way to diagnose AD is to follothese \n3 steps: \n1. Consider the probability that a patient has dementia. \n2. Diagnose dementia. \n3. Diagnose AD by ruling out other causes of dementia and \nensuring that the patient's symptoms are consistent with AD. \nC. Diagnosing dementia \n1. The prevalence of dementia in the older population is very \nhigh. The prevalence at different ages is given in Table 11-3. \n2. Screening tests \na. Multiple tests are used to screen patients for dementia. \nThree commonly used tests are the Mini-Mental Status \nExam (MMSE), the Mini-Cog, and The Montreal \nCognitive Assessment (MoCA). The Informant \nQuestionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly \n(IQCODE) is a tool that uses information from a \ncaregiver, family member, or friend. \n(1) MMSE \n(a) Most widely used test, scored out of 30 \n(b) Tests 5 domains and takes about 10 minutes to \nadminister. \nTable 11-3. Prevalence of dementia by age. \nPrevalence \nAge \nOutpatient \nlnpmtient \n65-75 \n2.1% \n6.4% \n> 75 \n11.7% \n13% \n>85 \n31.2% \n\n(2) Mini-Cog \n(a) 3-item recall and clock drawing (which serves as \nthe interference task) \n(b) It is scored out of 5 (1 point for each item and \n2 points fur a normal clock) and takes about \n3 minutes to administer. \n(3) MoCA \n(a) Initially developed and validated as a screening \ntest fur MCI. \n(b) Tests 7 domains takes 10 minutes to administer \nand is scored out of 30. \n(4) IQCODE \n(a) Short form is a 16-item questionnaire. \n(b) Takes about 10 minutes to complete, may be \ndone by the informant during a patient visit, is \nscored by calculating an average score. \nb. Test characteristics for these tests, taken &om various \nCochrane reviews, appear in Table 11-4. \n3. Neuropsychiatric testing \na. Considered the clinical gold standard for diagnosing \ndementia \nb. Neuropsychiatric testing can be very helpful when the \ndiagnosis of dementia is especially difficult. \nc. Situations in which neuropsychiatric testing is commonly \nused are \n(1) When there is disagreement between the clinical \nsuspicion and in-office tests. \n(2) To specifically gauge deficits in order to recommend \nways of compensating. \n(3) When present or suspected psychiatric disease \n(usually depression) complicates the diagnosis. \n(4) When a more definitive diagnosis would be helpful \nfor the patient or f.unily members. \nNeuropsychiatric testing is especially useful \nwhen in office testing is negative despite a high \nclinical suspicion of dementia. \nD. The diagnosis of AD is clinical, based on the diagnosis of \ndementia and the presence of features consistent with AD. \n1. Various office-based tests are useful in making this \ndiagnosis. The National Institute of Neurological and \nCommunicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's \nDisease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-\nADRDA) criteria for probable AD are currently the most \ncommonly used by specialists. \nTable 11-4. Test characteristics for the MMSE, some of its \ncomponents, and other tests in the diagnosis of dementia. \nTest \nSensitivity \nSpecificity \nLR+ \nLR-\nMMSE(<24) \n85% \n90% \n.017 \nMini-Cog(< 3) \n76% \n73% \n2.8 \n0.33 \n--------------------------------------------------------- \nMoCA(<26) \n94% \n60% \n2.35 \n0.10 \nIQ CODE \n80% \n5.2 \n0.23 \nMMSE, Mini-Mental Status Exam; MOCA, The Montreal Cognitive Assessment; IQCODE, \nThe Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. \nDELIRIUM AND DEMENTIA I 209 \n2. Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of probable AD include \nall of the following: \na. Dementia \nb. Deficits in 2 or more areas of cognition \n(1) Orientation \n(2) Registration \n(3) Visuospatial and executive functioning \n(4) Language \n(5) Attention and working memory \n(6) Memory \nc. Progressive worsening of memory and other cognitive \nfunctions \nd. No disturbance of consciousness \ne. Onset between ages 40 and 90, most often after age 65 \nf. Absence of other disorders that could account for the \nsymptoms \n3. The test characteristics for these criteria are: \na. Sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 84% \nb. LR+, 5.19; LR-, 0.2 \n4. The NINCDS-ADRDA also gives factors that support the \ndiagnosis. These are very hdpful clinically, although none \nare necessary to make the diagnosis. Some of these are \nincluded below: \na. Progressive deterioration of specific cognitive functions \n(1) Aphasia \n(2) Apraxia \n(3) Agnosia \nb. Impaired AD Ls and altered patterns of behavior \nc. Family history of dementia \nd. Normal lumbar puncture, normal or nonspecific EEG \nfindings, and cerebral atrophy on neuroimaging \n5. Because these criteria are not perfect in the diagnosis of \nAD, patients in whom dementia or AD is suspected but \nwho do not meet the criteria should be monitored closely \nor referred for more detailed neuropsychiatric testing. \nE. Reversible dementias \n1. An important issue when diagnosing AD is homuch \nmore of a workup should be done? The concern is that \nwhen making a clinical diagnosis, potentially reversible \ndementias might be missed. These reversible dementias \ninclude: \na. CNS infections \nb. Hypothyroidism \nc. Vitamin B12 deficiency \nd. CNS masses \n(1) Neoplasms \n(2) Subdural hematomas \ne. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus \nf. Medications \n2. Current practice is to order the following tests: \na. CBC \nb. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) \nc. Basic metabolic pand and liver biochemical tests \nd. Vitamin B12 level \ne. Tests to exclude neurosyphilis \nf. Consider neuroimaging (MRI or CT) \n\n210 I CHAPTER 11 \n(1) Imaging is not required in most patients with \ndementia. \n(2) In practice, most patients will undergo imaging \nboth to assess for diagnoses other than AD and to \ndetect brain atrophy that may support the diagnosis \nof AD. \nTreatment \nA. Counseling \nI. When the diagnosis of AD is made, patients and families \nshould be educated on course, complications, and prognosis \nof the disease. \n2. Decisions need to be made regarding health care proxies, \nfinancial and estate planning, and end-of-life care. \n3. It is crucial to make these decisions while the patient is still \na competent decision maker. Referral to suppon services, \nsuch as the Alzheimer's Association, may be helpful. \n4. Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) is a validated tool \nhelpful for identifying, tracking, and monitoring functional \ndecline. It is especially helpful to guide conversations about \ninitiating hospice care. \nB. Safety \n1. As dementia progresses, patient safety often becomes an \nissue. \n2. Driving, wandering, and cooking are often early concerns. \na. Driving is usually the most difficult to address because \npatients lack insight into the dangers they pose and \nresist the loss of independence that not driving brings. \nb. Physicians should raise this issue, since it is often \ndifficult for caregivers to bring up. \nc. Patients with even mild dementia should either be \ntold to not drive or be required to undergo frequent \nperformance evaluations. \nd. Home safety checklists are available online that can help \nfamily members protect patients with dementia. \nC. Behavioral \nI. Caregivers should be told to expect behavioral and \npersonality changes and be instructed on hoto respond. \n2. Maintenance of routines is imponant. \n3. Situations likdy to be stressful to patients, such as those \nin which a patient's deficits interfere with his functioning, \nshould be avoided. \nD. Pharmacotherapy \n1. Cholinesterase inhibitors \na. 4 cholinesterase inhibitors are approved for treatment \n(1) Donepezil \n(2) Tacrine \n(3) Rivastigmine \n(4) Galantamine \nb. These medications have been shown to have modest eflectli \non objective measures of dementia and functional status. \n2. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist also approved \nfor the treatment of AD. It has similar efficacy to the drugs \nabove and may be used in combination with cholinesterase \ninhibitors. \n3. Associated neuropsychiatric symptoms \na. May include agitation (60-70%) or either delusions or \nhallucinations (30-60%) \nb. Atypical neuroleptics, such as olanzapine and \nrisperidone, are frequently used but the evidence base \nfor their efficacy is poor and they are associated with \nhigher monality. Neither of these drugs is approved for \nthis indication. \n4. Depression \na. Very common in patients with AD \nb. Present in up to 50% of patients \nc. All patients with AD should be screened for depression \nand treated if it is found. \nS. Caregiver support \na. Taking care of a friend or relative with AD is challenging. \nb. Caregivers should be counseled on the importance of \ntaking time off and the availability of respite care. \nc. They should be counseled that behavioral difficulties \nare a result of the disease and not the patient's anger or \nheartlessness. \nd. Caregiver support groups can be extremely helpful. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. R's exam thus far reveals some difficulty with recalling recent \nevents. Given his age, his baseline risk of dementia is at least 10%. \nThe first step in his workup would be to perform a screening tests \nfor dementia. If this is positive, consider whether he fulfllls the \nNINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. \n\nFurther history revealed that the pat ient's wtfe had taken \nover bookkeeping because a fobills had gone unpaid during \nthe last 3 months. \nThe patient was given the Mini-Cog and scored 2 outof 5. \nConsideration of t he NINCDS-ADRDA criteria showed him \nto have dement ia with deficits In 2 or more areas of c~\nnltlon (orientation, v1suospat lal and executive functioning, \nattention and working memory, and memory). At the t ime \nof the visit, It was not clear whether his cognitive func-\ntioning was worsening, and t here were no disturbances in \nconsciousness. \nThe plan was made for initial laboratory work to be done \nand for a 3-month follow-up visit . Given that he was taking \nmultiple psychoactive medications, his regimen was scaled \nback to the minimum doses necessary to cont rol his pain. \nHave you croseed a dlagnoetlc threehold for \nthe leading hypothesis, AD'I Have you ruled \nout the active alternatlvas'I Do other taet5 \nnlS&I to be dona to exclude the altamatlva \ndiagnoses'/ \nAlternative Diagnosis: Multi-infarct Dementia \n(Vascular Dementia, VaD) \nTextbook Presentation \nThe onset of VaD may be abrupt or gradual. The patient usually \nhas risk factors for, or has previously diagnosed, vascular disease. \nThe patient may have gait disturbance during the neurologic exam. \nDisease Hi.ghligb.ts \nA. Generally considered to be the most common cause of demen-\ntia after AD. \n\nB. Most common in patients with risk factors fur vascular disease \nor an embolic stroke. \nC. Patients have dementia and evidence that cerebrovascular \ndisease has caused the dementia. \n1. A classic but insensitive clue is a \"step-like deterioration\" \nrdated to intermittent CVAs. \n2. Other clues are a focal neurologic exam or evidence of \nstrokes, white matter changes, or atrophy on neuroimaging. \nD. Symptoms of VaD include gait disturbance, urinary symptoms, \nand personality changes. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The DSM-5 criteria for the clinical diagnosis ofVaD are: \n1. The criteria arc met fur major or mild neurocognitive \ndisorder. \n2. The clinical features are consistent with a vascular etiology, \nas suggested by either of the following: \na. Onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to \none or more cerebrovascular events. \nb. Evidence for decline is prominent in complex attention \n(including processing speed) and frontal-executive \nfunction. \n3. There is evidence of the presence of cerebrovascular \ndisease from history, physical exam, and/or neuroimaging \nconsidered sufficient to account for the neurocognitive \ndeficits. \n4. The symptoms are not better explained by another brain \ndisease or systemic disorder. \nB. Features consistent with the diagnosis ofVaD are: \n1. Exaggeration of deep tendon reflexes \n2. Extensor plantar response \n3. Gait abnormalities (consider history of unsteadiness and \nfrequent, unprovoked fu.lls) \n4. Pscudobulbar palsy (pathologic laughing, crying, grimacing; \nand weakness of the muscles associated with cranial nerves \nV, VII, IX, X. XI, and XII) \n5. Focal neurologic signs \nC. The actual diagnosis ofVaD is complicated by the presence of \nmultiple different criteria. \nD. The Hachinski Ischemic Score seems to be a clinically useful \ntest for determining whether ischemic disease is playing a role \nin a patient's dementia. \n1. In the score, two points are given for each of the following \nfeatures: \na. Abrupt onset \nb. Fluctuating course \nc. History of stroke \nd. Focal neurologic signs and symptoms \n2. One point is given for each of the following features: \na. Stepwise deterioration \nb. Nocturnal confusion \nc. Preservation of personality \nd. Depression \ne. Somatic complaints \n Emotional !ability \ng. Hypertension \nb. Atherosclerosis \nDELIRIUM AND DEMENTIA I 211 \n3. A score of> 7 carries an LR+ of 8.3 for differentiating VaD \nfrom AD. The score performs less well for differentiating \nAD or VaD from a mixed dementia. \nTreatment \nA. Behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical means of modifying risk \nfactors for cerebrovascular disease and preventing recurrent \nvascular events should be used. \nB. Behavioral interventions include smoking cessation and \ndietary intervention to decrease vascular risk. \nC. Pharmacologic interventions include treatment of hyperten-\nsion and diabetes mellitus, treatment of hypercholesterolemia \n(to an LDL < 70 mg/dL), aspirin therapy, and anticoagulation \nwhen indicated. \nD. Surgical therapy includes carotid endarterectomy when \nindicated. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nInitial laboratory evaluation. Including CBC. TSH, ba5lc met-\nabolic panel and liver blochemlcal test5, vitamin B, 2 level, \nwere normal and 5yphlll5 lgG ab was negative. He wa5 able \nto wean his medications and felt like he had a little more \nenergy. On a follow-up vi5it 3 months later, the patient'5 wife \nreported that he was no longer driving to his job because \nIt had become too difficult. On physical exam, hl5 language \nskl[[s had worsened, and he frequently answered c:i.ue5tions \nwtth short affirmative phrases and nods that were often \ncontradicted by his wife. (He would subsequently agree wtth \nher.) A GT scan with contrast was ordered and showed only \ncerebral atrophy. \nAD can be confidently diagnosed in this patient. He has no risk \nfactors for VaD. His ischemia score is one. Dementia was diag-\nnosed at his previous visit; since his symptoms have progressed, \nhe nofulfills the criteria for AD. Reversible causes of dementia \nare unlikely given the normal evaluation. The patient's functional \nlimitations exclude MCI as a cause. The patient has no symptoms \nof delirium or depression. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nMild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) \nTatbook Presentation \nUsually presents in an older patient complaining of memory \nloss. Common complaints are difficulty remembering names and \nappointments or solving complex problems. Detailed testing shows \nabnormal memory, but patients have no functional impairment. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. MCI is a diagnosis that stands between the normal, age-related \ndecline in cognition and dementia. \nB. The diagnosis can be difficult to make as memory complaints, \nand concern about dementia, are very common in older people. \nC. 4 types of MCI are: \n1. Single domain amnestic MCI in which people have \nmemory loss and no other deficits. \n\n212 I CHAPTER 11 \n2. Multiple domain amnestic MCI in which people have \nmemory loss as well as other deficits. \n3. Single domain non-amnestic MCI in whic:h people have \nimpairment in a single, non-memory-related, cognitive \ndomain. \n4. Multiple domain non-amnestic MCI in whic:h people have \nimpairment in multiple, non-memory-related, cognitive \ndomain. \nD. Patients with this disorder are not neurologically normal. \n1. For patients with amnestic types of MCI, their memory is \nworse than age-matched controls. \n2. Patients with MCI have a higher rate of progression to \ndementia than age-matched controls. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Patients with MCI generally have a normal score on MMSE \n(sensitivity only 18%). \nB. The MoCA was initially developed to evaluate MCI; the test \nc:haracteristic:s are: \n1. Sensitivity 90% \n2. Specificity 87% \n3. LR+ 6.92 \n4. LR-0.11 \nC. The diagnosis of MCI is often made on neuropsychiatric testing. \nD. Evaluation for reversible causes, as in patients with dementia, \nis appropriate. \nTreatment \nPresently, there is no proven treatment for MCI. Patients should \nbe monitored closely for development of more severe cognitive or \nfunctional decline. \nDementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) \nTextbook Presentation \nDLB is typically seen in a patient with Parkinson disease who has \ndementia. The predominant symptoms of dementia are a fluctuat-\ning course and the presence of hallucinations. In patients without \na previous diagnosis of Parkinson disease, motor symptoms similar \nto those seen in Parkinson disease are often present. \nDisease Highlights \nA. DLB is among the most common types of dementia after AD. \n1. Lewy bodies are seen in the conex of about 20% of patients \nwith dementia. \n2. Lewy bodies may be present in some patients with a clinical \ndiagnosis of AD thus DLB may coexist with AD. \nB. The most important features of DLB are included in the \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis section below. \nC. Patients with DLB may have a fluctuating course. \n1. Early in the disease, patients may be nearly normal at times \nand significantly impaired at others. \n2. Because of the fluctuation in symptoms, delirium needs to \nbe included in the differential diagnosis. \nD. Visual hallucinations are common in DLB, unlike in most \nother types of dementia. \nE. Mild extrapyramidal motor symptoms (rigidity and bradyki-\nnesis) are often seen. These may occur late in the course of \nother dementias but occur early with DLB. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nThe diagnostic criteria for DLB are presented below. \nA. There is dementia (often mild at onset). \nB. 2 of the following are essential for a diagnosis of probable DLB: \n1. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in \nattention and alertness \n2. Recurrent visual hallucinations that are typically well-formed \nand detailed \n3. Spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism \nC. The following features are supportive of the diagnosis ofDLB: \n1. Repeated falls \n2. Syncope \n3. Transient loss of consciousness \n4. Neuroleptic: sensitivity \n5. Systematized delusions and hallucinations \nTreatment \nA. Supportive treatment of patients with DLB is the same as for \npatients with AD. \nB. Cholinesterase inhibitors have also been shown to be effective. \nC. Neuroleptic:s can be dangerous, potentially worsening symptoms. \nPatients with dementia with parkinsonian \nfeatures, a fluctuating course, and visual hallu-\ncinations should be evaluated for DLB before \nthey are treated with neuroleptic:s. \nREFERENCES \nBenbadis SR, Sila CA, Cristea RL.

Type 1 DM \n1. Of the persons with DM in Canada, the United States, and \nEurope, 5-10% have type 1. \n2. Caused by cdlular-mediated autoimmune destruction \nof the pancreatic beta cells in genetically susceptible \nindividuals, triggered by an undefined environmental \nagent \na. Some combination of antibodies against islet cells, \ninsulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), or \ntyrosine phosphatases IA-2 and IA-2beta are found \nin 85-90% of patients. \nb. Strong HLA association \nc. Risk is 0.4% in patients without family history, 5-6% \nin siblings and children, and 30% in monozygotic \ntwins. \nd. Patients are also prone to autoimmune thyroid disease, \nAddison disease, vitiligo, celiac disease, autoimmune \nhepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia. \n3. Insulin therapy is always necessary. \n4. Because of the complete lack of insulin production, \npatients are at high risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). \nB. Type2DM \n1. Caused by a progressive loss of beta cdl insulin secretion \nfrequently with underlying insulin resistance \n2. A heterogeneous disorder related to inflammation, metabolic \nstress, and genetic factors \nC. Other, less common causes of diabetes \n1. Monogenic diabetes syndromes \n2. Exocrine pancreatic diseases that lead to the destruction \nof beta cdls (pancreatitis, trauma, cystic fibrosis, \npancreatectomy, pancreatic carcinoma) \n3. Endocrinopathies (acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, \nglucagonoma, pheochromocytoma) \n4. Drug or chemical-induced (conicosteroids, HIV/AIDS \nmedications, after organ transplantation) \nD. Gestational diabetes \nType 1 DM generally occurs in children, although approxi-\nmately 7.5-10% of adults assumed to have type 2 DM actually \nhave type 1, as defined by the presence of circulating antibodies. \nType 2 DM is becoming more prevalent in teenagers and young \nadults, presumably related to the increased prevalence of obesity. \nIn most patients, the distinction between type 1 and type 2 DM \nis clear. Thus, the primary tasks of the clinician are to determine \nwho should be tested for diabetes, who has diabetes, which compli-\ncations to monitor, and hoto treat the patient. \n\nMrs. D ha5 worried about hav!n(:! dlabete5 51nce her father \ndied of cam pllcatlon5 from the dl5ea5e. Over the la5t couple \nof weeks, she has been urinating more often and note5 larger \nvolume5 than usual.

Given thle \ndifferential dlaeno5ls, what tests 5hould 17e \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMrs. D's pretest probability of diabetes is high because of2 pivotal \npoints in her history, the polyuria and the positive family history. \nExcess fluid intake and diseases that cause true polyuria, defined \nas urinary output of> 3 Uday, should also be considered. Bladder \ndysfunction and urinary tract infection generally cause frequent, \nsmall volume urination. Since patients sometimes have trouble \nquantifying the amount of urine produced, causes of small volume \nurinary frequency should be kept in the differential. Table 12-1 \nlists the differential diagnosis. \n\nMr5. D ha5 no dy5Urla or hematuria.

A random plasma glucose ls 152 mg/dl. \n~ \nle the cllnlcal Information 9ufflclent to make a \n1~Jll\"' diagnosis? If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Type 2 DM \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with type 2 DM can have the classic symptoms of poly-\nuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. The presentation can also be more \nsubtle, with patients complaining that they fed tired or \"just not \nright.\" Many patients are asymptomatic; the diagnosis is made after \nplasma glucose testing. The complications of diabetes may already \nbe present by the time patients seek medical attention. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Caused by a combination of impaired insulin secretion and \ninsulin resistance with no evidence of autoimmunity \nB. Accounts for 90-95% of cases ofDM, with prevalence in the \nUnited States of about 9.4%, with considerable variation by \nethnic group \n1. The prevalence in American Indian/Alaska Native persons \nis 15.1%. \n2. The prevalence in black and Hispanic persons is 12-14%. \n3. The prevalence in Asian, non-Hispanic persons is 8%, with \nAsian Indians having the highest prevalence (11.2%). \n4. The prevalence in white, non-Hispanic persons is 7.4%. \nC. Diabetes is undiagnosed in 24% of people. \nD. Strong genetic component \n1. 39% of patients have at least 1 parent with diabetes \n2. 60-90% concordance in monozygotic twins \n3. The lifetime risk of a first-degree relative of a patient with \ntype 2 D M is 5-10 times higher than that of age- and \nweight-matched individuals without a family history. \nE. The most impottant risk factor is obesity, which induces \ninsulin resistance. \n1. The relative risk of diabetes developing in a woman who \nhas a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2 is 93, compared \nwith a woman who has a BMI < 22 kg/m2 \n2. The relative risk of diabetes developing in a man who has \na BMI > 35 kg/m2 is 42, compared with a man who has a \nBMI < 23 kg/m2 \nF. DKA devdops less often in patients with type 2 DM than \nthose with type 1; however, DKA can occur in persons with \ntype 2 DM. Recent data shothat two-thirds of patients with \nDKA have type 1 DM, and one-third have type 2 DM. \nDo not assume all patients with DKA have \ntype 1 DM; DKA can develop in persons with \ntype2DM. \nG. Risk factors for type 2 DM include \n1. Age~ 45 \n2. BMI <!: 25 kg/m2 \n3. A first-degree relative with diabetes \n4. Physical inactivity \n5. Being a member of a high-risk ethnic group (African \nAmerican, Latino, Native American, Asian American, \nPacific Islander) \n6. Having delivered a baby weighing > 9 pounds or having \nhad gestational DM \n7. Hypertension \n8. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol < 35 mg/dL \nor triglycerides > 250 mgldL \n9. Polycystic ovary syndrome \n10. Vascular disease \n11. Prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], impaired \nfasting glucose [IFG], or mildly elevated HbA10; see \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis section for definitions) \na. Patients with either IGT or IFG have a 5-10% annual \nrisk of developing diabetes; those with both have a \n10-15% annual risk. \nb. Patients with an H~. in the prediabetes range have an \nannual risk of 10-50% with the risk increasing as the \nHbA10 increases. \nc. These annual risks are 10-20 times higher than in \npeople without prediabetes. \nH. Screening for diabetes \n1. American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends \nscreening patients beginning at age 45. \na. Screening should be done at any age in patients with \na BMI :!: 25 (:!: 23 in Asian Americans) and 1 of the \nadditional risk factors listed above. \nb. Screening should be done every 3 years in patients \nwith normal results, and every year in patients with \nprediabetes. \n\nTable 12-2. American Diabetes Association diagnostic \ncriteria for prediabetes and diabetes. \nNormal \nFasting Plasma \nGlucose \n< lOOmg/dL \nPrediabetes \n100-125 mg/dl \nDlabetes1 \nO? 126mg/dl \n2-Hour Pluma \nGlucose (After 75-g \nOral Glucose Load) \ns 140mg/dl \n140-199mg/dL \n0?200mg/dl \n'A random plasma glucose :. 200 mg/dl also diagnoses diabetes. \nHbA,, \n<5.7% \n5.7-6.4% \nO? 6.5% \n2. In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended \nscreening adults aged 40--70 years who are overweight or \nobese (B recommendation). \nEvidence-Based. Diagnosis \nA. Table 12-2 lists the ADA diagnostic criteria for diabetes and \nprediabetes. \nB. The ADA recommends that all abnormal results be confirmed \nwith repeat testing. \nC. Most physicians screen with either the fasting plasma glucose \n(FPG), HbA1c, or both; the oral glucose tolerance test is used \nprimarily to screen for gestational diabetes. \n1. FPG is widely available and inexpensive; the primary \ndisadvantage is the need for fasting at least 8 hours. \n2. The HbA1c is noglobally standardized and does not \nrequire futing. \na. Falsely lovalues can occur in patients with rapid red \ncell turnover, such as in hemoglobinopathies, active \nhemolysis, erythropoietin treatment, and stage 4 or 5 \nchronic kidney disease. \nb. Falsely high values can be seen when red cell turnover is \nlow, such as in iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency. \nc. African American patients tend to have slightly higher \nHb~c levels (0.2-0.4%) than white patients at the same \nglucose levels. \nD. Patients may have abnormal results on 1 or both tests; in \n1 srudy, one-third of nediabetes cases were detected by FPG \ntesting only, one-third by Hb~0 testing only, and one-third by \nboth tests. \nPatients with normal HbA10 levels may still \nhave diabetes by fasting glucose criteria. \nTreattnent of Prediabetes \nA. The goals are to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes and to \noptimize other cardiac risk factors. \nB. Large randomized trials have shown that lifestyle modification \nor medication can prevent or delay diabetes. \n1. Finnish patients with IGT were randomized to brief \ndiet/exercise counseling or intensive individualized \ninstruction. \na. There was a 58% relative reduction in the development \nof diabetes in the intensive group, (NNT = 22 to \nprevent 1 case ofDM over 1 year; NNT = 5 to prevent \n1 case ofDM over 5 years). \nDIABETES I 217 \nb. The study cohort has been monitored for 7 years post-\nintervention; the group of patients initially assigned to \nthe intensive lifestyle intervention maintained a 43% \nrelative risk reduction in the development of diabetes. \n2. Patients in the United States (45% African American \nor Hispanic) were randomized to intensive diet/exercise \nprogram, metformin, or placebo. \na. There was a 58% relative reduction in the development \nof DM in the intensive diet/exercise group and a 31 % \nrelative reduction in the metformin group. \nb. NNT = 7 over 3 years to prevent 1 case of diabetes for \nthe intensive diet/exercise group, and NNT = 14 for the \nmetformin group. \nc. The patients initially assigned to the intensive diet! \nexercise program maintained a 34% relative risk \nreduction in the development of diabetes over 10 years. \n3. Acarbose, orlistat, liraglutide, and pioglitazone have also \nbeen studied, but the ADA does not recommend their use \nin diabetes prevention. \n~ \nLifestyle modification is the best way to \ny \nprevent or delay the onset of diabetes. \nC. Optimal lifestyle modification goals are 150 minutes of \naerobic exercise weekly, such as brisk walking, and losing \n7% of the baseline body weight. \nD. None of the drugs studied is FDA approved for diabetes \nprevention; the ADA recommends considering metformin in \npatients under 60 with a BMI > 35 and/or with progressive \nhyperglycemia, or those with a history of gestational diabetes. \nE. The goal of hypertension therapy in patients with prediabetes \nis the same as that for patients without diabetes (see Chapter 23, \nHypertension). \nF. Hyperlipidemia should be treated according to current guide-\nlines for nondiabetic patients (see Chapter 23, Hypertension). \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMrs. D's random glucose ls elevated but Is not diagnost ic \nof diabetes. She reports t hat when she reduces her fluid \nintake, she urinates less. You ask her to return for more \ntesti119: \nFPG, 120 mg/dl \nHbA10,6.0% \nUrinalysis: negative for protein, glucose, and blood; \nno WBCs or bacteria; specific gravit y, 1.015. \nHave you crosSBd a diagnostic threshold for \nthe ludlng hypothnle, type 2 DM1 Have \nyou ruled out the active alt8rnatlvee1 Do \nother t8e\"e9 need to be done to exclude the \nalternative dlagnoeeeV \nMrs. D does not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes, but \nshe does have prediabetes. This does not cause glycosuria of a \ndegree sufficient to cause urinary frequency. A urinary tract \ninfection is ruled out by the normal urinalysis. She has increased \nher water consumption, so excess fluid intake is a likely cause of \n\n218 I CHAPTER 12 \nher symptoms. Bladder dyi;function should be considered if her \nsymptoms do not resolve with the reduction in fluid intake. Dia-\nbetes insipidus and primary polydipsia are rare diseases that do \nnot need to be considered unless she has a documented urinary \noutput of more than 3 L/day. The next diagnostic test should be \nreducing her fluid intake. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. D stops forcitl!:l herself to drink extra water, and her \nurination pattern returns to normal. She is very concerned \nabout her elevated FPG and wants to knohoto prevent \np~resslon to diabetes. Her BMI Is 30 ~m\n- and her \nfasting lipid panel shows total cholesterol of 220 mg/dl; \nHDL. 38 mg/dL; trlglycerides. 250 mg/dl; and low-density \nlipoprotein (LDL). 132 mg/dl. You refer her to a dieti-\ncian for dietary counsel!ng and recommend that she walk \n30 minutes per day 5 days a week. When she returns to \nsee you 4 months later. she has lost 8 pounds. Her FPG Is \n112 mg/dl; total cholesterol 197 mg/dl, HDL, 42 mg/dl; \ntrlglycerldes, 150 mg/dl; and LDL, 125 mg/dL. \nFOLLOW-UP OF MRS. D \n\nMrs. D returns 5 years later, having lived in another city in \nthe meantime. She reports that she did quite well with her \ndiet and exercise p~ram for several years. maintaining a \n1 0% weight loss. However, over the last couple of years, she \nhas not been able to continue her exercise program or be \nas careful about her diet because ofthe stresses of caring \nfor her chronically ill mother as well as workitl!:l and caring \nfor her own family. Her mother died recently, so Mrs. D has \nmoved back. She knows that she has gained weight and \nIs especlally worried about her blood sugar level because \nshe did not have time to see a doctor herself during her \nmother's illness. \nOn physical exam, her BMI is no34 kg/m2 (up 4 kg/m2 \nfrom her initial visit), and her BP is 155/88 mm Hg. Her \nlungs are clear, and on cardiac exam, you hear an 5 4 but \nno S 15 or murmurs. Abdominal exam is normal, and there \nIs no peripheral edema. Her peripheral pulses are normal. \nand there are no ulcerations on her feet. She does have \ntlnea pedis. Her point-of-care glucose measurement Is \n335 mg/dL. \nAt this point, what le the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altemativee, and is \nthere a muet not mil!ll!I diagnoele7 Given thle \ndifferential dlagnoele, what tests should 17e \nordensd1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nClearly, Mrs. D nohas type 2 DM. At this point, in addition to \nstarting treatment, the clinician should focus on identifying and \nmanaging diabetic complications and associated cardiovascular risk \nfactors rather than ruling out other diagnoses (Table 12-3). \nTable 12-3.

Retinopathy \nTextbook Presentation \nMost patients with retinopathy are asymptomatic. Other patients \nexperience either gradual or sudden vision loss. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Most common cause of necases of blindness in adults aged \n20-74 years. \nB. Incidence and risk of progression have declined over the past \n30 years, with a 77% decrease in the annual incidence of \nretinopathy in patients with type 1 DM. \n\nC. Stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR) \n1. Nonproliferative (NPDR) \na. Earlier stage of DR \nb. Earliest signs are microaneurysm.s and retinal \nhemorrhages \nc. Progressive capillary nonperfusion leads to ischemia, \nmanifested by increasing cotton wool spots, venous \nbeading, and intraretinal vascular abnormalities. \n2. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) \na. Most advanced form of DR \nb. Progressive retinal ischemia causes the formation of ne\nblood vessds on the retina or optic disk. \nc. The nevessels bleed, leading to vision loss because of \nvitreous hemorrhage, fibrosis, or retinal detachment. \n3. Diabetic macular edema \na. Can devdop at any stage of retinopathy \nb. Nothe leading cause of vision loss in persons with \ndiabetes \nc. Increased vascular permeability causes plasma leaks from \nthe macular vessels, leading to swelling and formation of \nhard exudates at the central retina. \nD. Risk factors include duration of DM, elevated HbA1c level, \nhypertension, dyslipidemia, pregnancy, and nephropathy. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Evaluation should include dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy or \nfundus photography, or both, by an ophthalmologist. \nB. Patients with type 1 DM should have an exam within 5 years \nof disease onset, followed by at least annual exams. \nC. Patients with type 2 DM should have an exam at the time of \ndiagnosis, followed by at least annual exams; patients with \nwell-controlled DM and no retinopathy may be able to have \nexams every 2 years. \n~ \nMost patients with type 2 DM need eye exams \ny \nby an ophthalmologist at least annually. \nD. Screening fundus photography using smartphones is being \nstudied in loresource areas. \nTreatment \nA. Glycemic control \n1. In persons with type 1 DM without retinopathy, the risk \nof developing DR is reduced 76% by tight control (HbA1c \n7.2% vs 9.1% in the Diabetes Control and Complications \nTrial). \n2. In persons with type 1 DM with retinopathy, the risk of \nprogression is reduced by 54% by tight control. \n3. In persons with type 2 DM, better control reduces the \nrisk of microvascular complications (retinopathy and \nnephropathy) by 16-25%. (HbA~c 7% vs 7.9% in the \nUnited Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS] \n[1998]; HbA1c 6.5% vs 7.2% in the ADVANCE trial \n[2008].) \n4. In persons with type 2 DM, there is a 35% reduction in \nthe risk of microvascular complications fur every percentage \npoint decrease in HbA1c-\nB. Better BP control reduces the incidence and progression of \nretinopathy. \nDIABETES I 219 \nC. Aspirin neither improves nor worsens retinopathy; the \npresence of DR is not a contraindication to aspirin therapy. \nD. Laser photocoagulation is indicated for PDR and selected \ncases of severe NPDR. \nE. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, given by intraocular \ninjection, improves vision in patients with diabetic macular \nedema. \nF. There is some evidence that fenofibrate slows the progression of \nDR; it is recommended for secondary prevention in Australia \nand Canada. \n2. Neuropathy \nTextbook Presentation \nDiabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) can be focal but classically \npresents as paresthesias or burning pain in a \"stocking-glove,\" sym-\nmetric distribution. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can manifest \nin a variety of ways, including orthostatic dizziness, diarrhea, uri-\nnary incontinence, and gastroparesis. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Focal mononeuropathies \n1. Cranial (0.05% of mononeuropathies) \na. Usually cranial nerve III or VI \nb. Usually acute and transient \nc. Caused by ischemia \n2. Thoracolumbar \n3. Limb \na. Median nerve most common site (5 .8% of \nmononeuropathies) \nb. Ulnar (2.1 %), femoral, and peroneal also affected \nB. Diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (also called \ndiabetic amyotrophy): pain, severe asymmetric muscle weak-\nness, and wasting of the iliopsoas and quadriceps muscles \nC. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (most common manifesta-\ntion ofDPN) \nD. Epidemiology of distal symmetric polyneuropathy \n1. Found in at least 20% of patients with type 1 DM after \n20 years of the disease \n2. Found in 10-15% of people in whom type 2 DM is newly \ndiagnosed, with up to 50% of patients affected after 10 years \n3. May be present in 10-30% of people with prediabetes \n4. Patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy have a \n15-25% lifetime risk of a foot ulcer or gangrene and \na 15% lifetime risk of amputation. \n5. Severity is rdated to duration of disease, degree of glycemic \ncontrol, presence of hypertension, obesity, smoking, and \nhyperlipidemia. \nE. Clinical manifestations of distal symmetric polyneuropathy \n1. History and physical exam \na. Up to 50% of patients are asymptomatic \nb. Classified as small flber neuropathy, large flber \nneuropathy, or mixed \n(1) Small flber dysfunction causes stabbing pains, \nelectric shocks, allodynia, hyperalgesia and \nhyperesthesia \n(2) Small flber physical findings include abnormal \ntemperature and pinprick sensation and abnormal \n\n220 I CHAPTER 12 \nautonomic function (dry skin, poor blood flow, cold \nfeet, and impaired sweating) with normal strength, \nreflexes, and nerve conduction \n(3) Large flber neuropathy causes deep-seated, gnawing \nor aching pain, numbness and tingling, weakness, \nataxia, and poor balance \n(4) Physical findings in large fiber disease include \nimpaired reflexes, loss of proprioception and \nvibration sense, weakness in feet, wasting of small \nmuscles of hands and feet \nc. Symptoms often worse at night \nd. When symptoms ascend to the knees, upper extremity \nsymptoms start \n2. Charcot joints develop, usually in the tarsometatarsal \nregion, in I 0% of patients. \nF. Differential diagnosis of distal symmetric polyneuropathy \n1. Cervical myelopathy, lumbar stenosis, tarsal tunnel \nsyndrome, and digital neuropathies can all mimic DPN, \nand must be looked for on ph)75ical exam. \n2. Consider other causes of neuropathy if \na. There is greater impairment of motor than sensory \nfunction \nb. There is rapid progression of symptoms \nc. It is asymmetric \nd. Proximal or upper extremity involvement is \ndisproportionate to distal lower extremity involvement \n3. Be sure to check for other causes of peripheral neuropathy \n(eg, hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, monoclonal \ngammopathy}, even in patients with long-standing diabetes. \n~ \nThink about other causes of neuropathy in \ny \ndiabetic patients. \nG. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can affect any organ \ninnervated by the autonomic nervous S}'5tem. \n1. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy has many possible \nmanifestations. \na. Reduced heart rate variability; associated with increased \nrisk of silent ischemia and cardiac death \nb. Fixed heart rate \nc. Resting sinus tachycardia \nd. Inadequate increase in heart rate/BP with exercise \ne. Postural hypotension with S}'5tolic BP drop of \n> 20 mm Hg or > 10 mm Hg drop in diastolic BP \nf. lntraoperative cardiac instability \n2. Gustatory sweating \na. Facial sweating, often accompanied by flushing, that \noccurs after eating \nb. Generally occurs in patients with nephropathy or \nperipheral neuropathy \nc. Cause wtlcnown \n3. GI d}'5function \na. Reduced esophageal motility \nb. Gastroparesis \n(1) Abnormality of gastric motility leading to delayed \ngastric emptying \n(2) Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, \npostprandial fullness, early satiety. \n(3) Poor correlation between demonstrated motility \nabnormalities and symptoms \nc. Diabetic diarrhea \n(1) Characterized by intermittent, brown, watery, \nvoluminous stools, occasionally accompanied by \ntenesmus \n(2) Can be episodic, separated by periods of normal \nbowel movements or constipation \n(3) Rare in the absence of other manifestations of \nneuropathy, either peripheral or autonomic \nd. Constipation \n(1) Constipation specifically resulting from autonomic \nneuropathy occurs in 20% of patients with \ntype2DM. \n(2) Caused by abnormality in autonomic neural control \nof colonic motility \ne. Anorectal dysfunction \n(1) Results in fecal incontinence, even in the absence of \ndiarrhea \n(2) Patients can generally sense the presence of stool, \nbut cannot prevent passage \n4. Genitourinary d}'5function \na. Bladder d}'5function \n(1) Initially motor function normal, but sensation of \nbladder distention impaired \n(2) Then, detrusor muscle hypocontractility occurs, \nleading to urinary retention and overflo\nincontinence. \nb. Erectile d}'5function \n(1) Present in 28-45% of diabetic men \n(2) Most common organic cause of erectile d}'5function \n(3) Risk factors include duration ofDM, glycemic \ncontrol, smoking, other diabetic complications. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy \n1. Nerve conduction studies are the gold standard for large \nfiber neuropathies but are normal in small flber disease. \n2. A randomized trial showed that patients screened for \nDPN with a physical exam had lower amputation rates \nthan those not screened. \n3. The ADA recommends annual comprehensive foot exams \nincluding inspection, assessment of pedal pulses, testing \nfor small flber function with assessment of either pinprick \nor temperature sensation, assessing large flber function \nby testing vibration sense with a 128-Hz tuning fork, \nand identifying feet at risk for ulceration and amputation \nwith an annual 10-g monofllament test. (Patients with \nabnormal monofllament testing have a 2- to 10-fold risk of \ndeveloping a foot ulcer.) \n4. Although studies use variable physical exam techniques, the \nstandards follo(Table 12-4): \na. Semmes-Weinstein monofilament examination \n(1) Apply a 5.07/10-g monofllament to a non~callused \nsite on the dorsum of the first toe just proximal to \nthe nail bed. \n(2) Repeat 4 times on both feet in an arrhythmic manner. \n(3) Add up the total number of times the monofllament \nis perceived by the patient (score range= 0-8). \n\nTable 12-4. Physical exam findings in diabetic peripheral \nneuropathy. \nAble to perceive \nAble to perceive \nstimulus ~ 4 times \nstimulus s 3 times \n(normal test) \n(abnormal test) \nTest \nSensitivity ['M>) \nLR-\nSpecificity ('M>) \nLR+ \nMonofllament \n034 \n10.2 \nTimed vibration \n033 \n18.5 \nSuperficial pain \n0.5 \n9.2 \nOn-off vibration \n0.51 \n26.6 \n'This is the sensitMty when 7 /B monofilament applications are correctly identified. \n(4) Some studies test different sites with the \nmonofilament: plantar surfaces of the fuse, third, \nand fifth toes; the first, third, and fifth plantar \nmetatarsal heads, medial foot, lateral foot. One \nstudy showed that testing the third and fifth toes \nplus the first and third metatarsal heads identified \n95% of the patients with abnormal results on \n8-point testing. \nb. On-off vibration testing \n(1) Apply a vibrating 128-Hz tuning fork to the bony \nprominence at the dorsum of the first toe just \nproximal to the nail bed. \n(2) Repeat twice on each foot. \n(3) Add up the total number of times the patient \nperceives the application of the vibrating \ntuning fork and the cessation of the vibration \n(score range = 0-8). \nc. Timed vibration testing \n(1) Apply a vibrating 128-Hz tuning fork to the same \nlocation used for the on-off vibration test. \n(2) Ask the patient to repon the time at which \nvibration diminished beyond perception and \ncompare with the number of seconds perceived \nby the examiner when the tuning fork is applied \nto the examiner's thumb. \n(3) Record number of times patient's perception time is \nless than examiner's (score range= 0-8). \nd. Superficial pain sensation \n(1) Apply a sterile sharp to the same sites used for the \nmonofllament. \n(2) Repeat 4 times on each foot. \n(3) Add up the total number of times the \npatient did not perceive the painful stimulus \n(score range= 0-8). \n.5. Monofllament testing is more reproducible than timed \nvibration testing. \n6. Table 12-4 lists the test characteristics. \nPatients with any abnormal neurologic exam \nfindings in the foot are likely to have DPN \nand are at high risk for developing ulcera-\ntions; those with normal exams may have \nearly DPN but have a lower risk of developing \nulcerations. \nDIABETES I 221 \nB. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy \n1. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy \na. Cardiology consultation is necessary to evaluate hean \nrate variability. \nb. Postural change in systolic BP is used to diagnose \northostatic hypotension caused by diabetic autonomic \nneuropathy; the systolic BP is measured with the patient \nsupine and again after 2 minutes of standing. \n2. Gustatory sweating is diagnosed by history. \n3. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction \na. Esophageal dysmotilicy: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy \nand manometry \nb. Gastroparesis: Diagnosed clinically or by a \"gastric \nemptying\" study, consisting of double-isotope \nscintigraphy of either solids or liquids. \nc. Diabetic diarrhea: Rule out other causes of chronic \ndiarrhea. \nd. Anorectal dysfunction: Anorectal manometry and \ndefecography can be done to document abnormalities. \n4. Genitourinary dysfunction \na. Urinary bladder dysfunction: Ultrasound and \nurodynamic testing \nb. Erectile dysfunction: History \nTreatment \nA. Tight glycemic control \n1. Definitdy prevents and improves neuropathy in persons \nwith type 1 DM (rdative risk reduction of 60%, NNT of \n15 to prevent 1 case of neuropathy in tightly controlled \npatients) \n2. Possibly prevents and improves neuropathy in persons with \ncype2DM \nB. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic. \n1. Peripheral neuropathy \na. Pregabalin and duloxetine are FDA approved for the \ntreatment of neuropathic pain in diabetes. \nb. Gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants (such as \namitriptyHne or nortriptyline), and venlafaxine can \nalso be used. \nc. Tramadol has been shown to be effective in two \nmulticenter trials and can be considered in patients \nrefractory to other agents; other opioids should be \nconsidered only in consultation with a pain specialist. \nd. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs generally are not \neffective; capsaicin is possibly effective. \nAll patients with DM should receive foot care \neducation. Those with DPN or structural foot \nabnormalities should be referred to a podiatrist, \nand screening for peripheral anerial disease \nwith an ankle-brachial index is recommended \nby some guidelines. \n2. Autonomic neuropathy \na. Cardiovascular \n(1) Onhostatic hypotension is usually the most \ndisabling symptom. \n(a) Patients should raise head of bed and rise slowly. \n(b) Patients can try an elasticized garment that \nextends from the feet to the costal margins. \n\n222 I CHAPTER 12 \n(c) Midrodrine is FDA approved for the treatment \nof orthostatic hypotension. \n(2) Cardioselective beta-blockers are sometimes helpful. \nb. Sweating: no specific treatment available; clonid.ine may \nbe effective. \nc. Esophageal dysmotility: can try prokinetic agents such \nas metoclopramide but not for longer than 12 weeks \ndue to risk of tard.ive dyskinesia. \nd. Gastroparesis \n{l) Severe gastroparesis is very difficult to manage. \n(2) Small meals sometimes help. \n(3) Prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide or \nerythromycin, sometimes are effective. \n(4) Gastric electrical stimulation is being studied for \nrefractory cases. \ne. Constipation \n(l) Increase fiber. \n(2) Drug choices include lactulose, polyethylene glycol, \nstool softeners. \n(3) Avoid senna, cascara due to stimulant activity. \nf. Urinary bladder dysfunction \n(l) Bethanecol \n(2) Intermittent self-catheterization \ng. Erectile dysfunction: sildenafll and other similar agents \n3. Nephropathy \nTextbook Presentatlon \nDiabetic nephropathy is asymptomatic until it is advanced enough \nto cause symptoms of chronic kidney disease. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Occurs in 20--40% of patients with diabetes \nB. The most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in \nthe United States \nC. Definitions (based on spot collection and calculation of the \nalbumin/creatinine ratio in mcg/mg) \nl, Normal < 30 mcg/mg \n2. Microalbuminuria = 30-299 mcg/mg \n3. Macroalbuminuria (overt nephropathy) ~ 300 mcg/mg \nD. Natural history: much better defined for type 1 than for type \n2DM \nl. Type 1 DM \na. Renal enlargement and hyperfunction at onset of \ndiabetes; continues for 5-15 years \nb. Microalbuminuria appears 10-15 years after onset of \nDM; glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and BP initially \nnormal. \nc. Over the ensuing 10-15 years, 80% of patients progress \nto macroalbuminuria; GFR declines and hypertension \ndevelops. \nd. ESRD develops in 50% of patients with \nmacroalbuminuria within 10 years and in 75% by \n20 years. \n2. Type2DM \na. Natural history is less well defined because the onset of \ntype 2 DM is usually not well defined, and other causes \nof kidney disease (such as hypertension and vascular \ndisease) are common comorbidities. \nb. 20--40% of patients with microalbuminuria progress to \nmacroalbuminuria. \nc. 20% have ESRD within 20 years of the onset of \nmacroalbuminuria. \nE. Risk factors for development of nephropathy \n1. Poor glycemic control \n2. Hypertension \n3. Long duration ofDM \n4. Male sex \n5. Ethnic predisposition (Native American, African American, \nHispanic [especially Mexican American]) \nF. Patients with any amount of albuminuria have an increased \nrisk of cardiovascular events. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. ADA recommends annual screening for microalbuminuria \nbeginning at the time of diagnosis for patients with type 2 DM \nand starting at year 5 for patients with type 1 DM. \nB. The recommended screening is a spot urinary albumin/ \ncreatinine ratio. \n1. There is diurnal variation, so first-void or early-morning \nspecimens are best; otherwise, try to obtain confirmatory \nspecimen at same time of day as initial specimen. \n2. Short-term hyperglycemia, exercise, urinary tract \ninfection, marked hypertension, heart failure, and acute \nfebrile illness can cause transient elevations in albumin \nexcretion. \n3. Because of variability, 2 of 3 specimens in a 3- to 6-month \nperiod should be abnormal before diagnosing neor \nprogressive diabetic nephropathy. \n4. For morning specimens, sensitivity ranges from 70% to \n100% and specificity ranges from 91 % to 98%. \n5. For random specimens, sensitivity ranges from 56% to \n97% and specificity ranges from 81 % to 92%. \nC. It is not clear whether it is necessary to measure the albumin/ \ncreatinine ratio annually in patients being treated with an \nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angioten-\nsin receptor blocker (ARB); the ADA states it is \"reasonable\" \nto do so to monitor response to treatment and progression of \ndiabetic kidney disease. \nD. All patients should have a serum creatinine checked at least \nannually. \nTreatment \nA. Tight glycemic control reduces nephropathy. \n1. Type 1 DM: incidence of microalbuminuria is reduced by \nup to 43% and that of macroalbuminuria by 56%. \n2. Type2DM \na. Better control reduces the risk of microvascular \ncomplications (retinopathy and nephropathy) by \n16-25%. \nb. NNT = 36 over 10 years in the UKPDS; NNT = 66 \nover 5 years in the ADVANCE trial. \nc. The microvascular complication rate was 58% for \npatients with an Hb~c ~ 10% and 6.1 % for patients \nwith an Hb~c < 6.0% (UKPDS). \n\nd. Microvascular complication rate decreases by 37% fur \nevery 1 % reduction in HbA1c. \nB. BP control and choice of agents \n1. BP should be < 140/90 mm Hg; aiming fur a BP \n< 130/80 mm Hg is appropriate if it can be achieved \nwithout adverse medication effects. Diastolic BPs \n< 60-70 mm Hg should be avoided. \n2. Either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. \na. ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce \n(1) Progression to overt nephropathy in persons with \ntype 1 and type 2 DM who have hypertension and \nmicroalbuminuria \n(2) Progression to microalbuminuria in persons \nwith type 2 DM who have hypertension and \nnormoalbuminuria \n(3) Cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 DM \nb. ARBs have been shown to reduce progression to overt \nnephropathy in persons with type 2 DM who have \nhypertension and albuminuria. \nc. ACE inhibitors should be used first because of the \nreduction in cardiovascular events, with ARBs used in \npatients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. \nACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used \ntogether; doing so increases the incidence of \nacute kidney injury and hyperkalemia without \nleading to benefits beyond using either agent \nalone. \n3. There is some evidence that adding mineralocorticoid \nreceptor antag0nists, such as spironolactone, to an ACE \ninhibitor or ARB further reduces albuminuria although \ndoes not change the risk of progressive kidney disease; \nhyperkalemia is more frequent. \nC. There are conflicting data regarding the efficacy of dietary \nprotein restriction. \nD. There is emerging evidence that SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as \nempagliflozin, may reduce progression of nephropathy. \nE. When to refer to a nephrologist \n1. Uncertainty regarding the etiology of the kidney disease \n2. Advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR \n< 30 mUmin/1.73 m2 ) \n3. Complications of chronic kidney disease \na. Anemia \nb. Secondary hyperparathyroidism \nc. Metabolic bone disease \nd. Electrolyte abnormalities \nF. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended for primary \nprevention of diabetic kidney disease in patients with normal \nBP, normal albumin/creatinine ratio and normal estimated \nGFR. \n4. Diabetic Foot Ulcers \nTextbook Presentation \nA patient with peripheral neuropathy is unaware of minor trauma \nand the beginning of plantar ulceration. By the time the ulcer is \ndiscovered incidentally, it is usually advanced, often with associated \nosteomyditis. \nDIABETES I 223 \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Lifetime risk of devdoping an ulcer may be as high as 19-34%. \nB. Nearly all patients with ulcers have neuropathy, and over \n50% have peripheral arterial disease, a strong predictor of \nnonhealing ulcers. \nC. Tend to occur at pressure points, so plantar surface and sites of \ncalluses are common locations. \n1. Venous ulcers generally occur above the medial or lateral \nmalleolus. \n2. Arterial ulcers generally occur on the toes, metatarsal heads, \nor shins. \nD. Risk factors \n1. Previous amputation or foot ulcer \n2. Peripheral neuropathy \n3. Foot deformity \n4. Peripheral arterial disease \n5. Visual impairment \n6. Diabetic nephropathy {especially patients on dialysis) \n7. Poor glycemic control \n8. Smoking \n9. Preulcerative callus or corn \nE. Pathophysiology \n1. Biomechanical abnormalities: foot deformities and \nsometimes motor neuropathy leading to excess stress on \npressure points \n2. Loss of protective sensation: sensory neuropathy with \nimpaired or absent pain sensation leading to lack of \nawareness of incipient ulceration \n3. Skin changes: autonomic neuropathy with decreased sweating \nand dry skin leading to easily injured skin that heals poorly \n4. Repetitive external or minor trauma \n5. Peripheral artery disease: ischemia leading to poor healing \nand ulcer progression \nF. Classification of diabetic foot infections \n1. Mild \na. At least 2 of the following: local swelling or induration, \nerythema > 0.5 cm around the ulcer, local tenderness or \npain, local warmth, purulent discharge \nb.

Patients with neuropathy should have a foot exam at every \nvisit. \nYou cannot examine the feet of your diabetic \npatients too often, and you cannot examine \nthem with their shoes on! \nTable 12-6.

All patients with ulcers should have an ankle-brachial \nindex to look for peripheral arterial disease. \nC. Culturing ulcers \n1. Do not culture clinically uninfected ulcers. \n2. Do not obtain a specimen by swabbing the wound or \nwound drainage. \n3. Cleanse and debride the wound before obtaining a \nspecimen. \na. If purulent secretions are present, aspirate using a \nsterile needle or syringe. \nb. Obtain a tissue specimen by scraping the base \nof a debrided ulcer with a sterile scalpd or dermal \ncurette. \nD. Diagnosing complications \n1. Cellulitis: clinical diagnosis (see Chapter 17, Edema) \n2. Osteomyelitis (Table 12-6) \na. Open bone biopsy with culture is the gold standard. \nb. Needle bone biopsy for the diagnosis of \nosteomyelitis is subject to sampling error \n(sensitivity, 87%; specificity, 93%; LR+, 12.4; \nLR-, 0.14). \nc. Being able to see bone or to probe the ulcer down to \nbone substantially increases the probability the patient \nhas osteomyelitis. \nd. C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, \nCBC, blood cultures are not sufficiently sensitive or \nspecific to diagnose osteomyelitis. \ne. MRI is the imaging procedure with the best test \ncharacteristics; bone scan and WBC scans are less \nspecific but are sometimes done in patients who \ncannot undergo MRI. \nMRI scan is the best imaging procedure to \ndiagnose osteomyelitis in a patient with a \ndiabetic foot ulcer. \nA normal CBC, C-reactive protein, or \nerythrocyte sedimentation rate does not \nrule out osteomyelitis. \n\nTreatment \nA. Preventive foot care \n1. Improve glycemic control to reduce risk of neuropathy. \n2. Reduce vascular risk factors (smoking cessation, BP control, \nlipid management, glycemic control). \n3. Examine the feet of high-risk patients at every visit. \n4. Examine the feet oflow-risk patients at least annually. \nS. Ensure patients wear well-fitted shoes. \n6. Educate patients regarding need for daily visual inspection \nof feet. \n7. Refer to podiatrist for d6bridement of calluses, assessment \nof bony deformities. \nB. Treaonent of ulcers \n1. Treat any infection (see Table 12-5). \n2. Determine need for revascularization, and revascularize \nas early as possible in patients with treatable peripheral \nvascular disease. \n3. Heal the ulcer. \na. Offioading: use orthotics or fiberglass casts to remove \npressure &om the wound while allowing the patient to \nremain active. \nb. D~bride ulcers (surgically or with d~briding agents such \nas hydrogds). \nc. Control edema. \nd. Growth factors are being studied. \n4. Institute preventive measures once the ulcer has healed. \nA multidisciplinary approach, including inter-\nnal medicine, vascular surgery, and podiatry is \nnecessary for the optimal treaonent of diabetic \nfoot ulcers. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nThe ophthalmologist reports that Mrs. D has no retinop-\nathy.

Her \nfasting lipid panel shows total cholesterol of 230 mg/dL. \nHDL of 45 mg/dL, triglycerldes of 200 rng/dL, and LDL of \n145 mg/dL. You refer Mrs. D to a diabetes educator and a \ndietician for instruction about diet and exercise. You also \nprescribe metformln for diabetes and atorvastatin for \nhyperllpldemla. Because she has hypertension and mlcroal-\nbumlnuria, you elect to start an ACE lnhll:7itor, lislnopril, to \ntreat her hypertension. You also recommend t hat she start \ntaking aspirin, 81 mg daily, for primary prevention because \nshe has a high-risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-\nease (ASCVD). Over the next 12-18 months, Mrs. D loses \n5 pounds. You Increase the dose of metformln and add \ngliplzlde, and her H bA1 c decreases to 6. 7%. After Increasing \nthe d05e of 115inopril and adding hydrochlorothlazlde, her BP \nis 128/80 mm Hg. Her LDL is no85 mg/dL. \n\n226 I CHAPTER 12 \nTreatment of Type 2 DM \nThe treatment of type 2 DM involves not only the treatment of the \nhyperglyccmia but the management of associated complications \nand cardiow.scular risk factors as well. According to SUJ\"VCY data, \nonly 51 % of participants reach H~c goals, 51 % reach BP goals, \nand 57% reach cholesterol goals; oruy 14.3% reach all 3 goals. \n~ \nIt is common for patients to require 6-7 medi-\n,.,... cations to meet accepted treatment goals. \nTreatment of Hyperglycemia \nA. Treatment goals fur patients with type 2 DM \n1. The ADA recommends treating to a Hb~c < 7.0% in \nmany patients. \na. H~c levels < 7% have been dearly shown to reduce \nmicrovascular events in patients with type 2 DM \n(see data above). \nb. Intensive control has not been consistently shown to \nreduce macrovascular eYl:Ilts; intensive control may be \nharmful in oltin diabetics with cardiovascular disease \nand ma:y be beneficial in younger persons in whom \ndiabetes was recently diagnosed; speci.Sc agents, as \ndiscussed below, may reduce cardiovascular events. \n2. Goals should be modified for frail elderly, in whom \navoidance of hypoglycemia and optimization of \nfunctional status may be more important than tight \nglycemic control. \na. Little evidence that intensive control decreases \ncardiovascular events in older adults, especially those \nwith estimated lifi: expectancy less than 15 years. \nh. Harms, such as hypoglycemia and polypharmacy, arc \nmore likely in patients over 80 years of age, those with \ncognitive impairment, and those treated with insulin or \ncomplex regimens. \n3. Goals should be individualiu:d based on the overall health \nand age of the patient (Figures 12-1). \nB. Monitoring \n1. Measure HbA1< levels every 6 months in stable patients \nmeeting goals, and every 3 months in patients not meeting \ngoals or undergoing changes in therapy. \na. Table 12-8 shows the correlation between plasma glucose \nandHb~c \nb. 50% of HbA, is determined by glycem.ia during \nthe month befure tbe measurement, 25% from the \n30-60 days before, and 25% from 60-90 days before. \n2. Home glucose monitoring \na. Patients taking multiple doses of daily insulin should \nteat blood levels several times a day (fasting, before \nlunch, before dinner, and before bed); those taking \nbedtime long-acting insulin should test in the morning. \nh. Optimal frequency fur patients taking oral agents is \nunclear; data regarding effects on control are mixed but \nshoonly slight improvement at best. \nC. Lifestyle modification \n1. Weight loss (goal of at least 10% of body weight), diet \nmodification, and exercise (goal of at least 150 minutes/week) \nare the foundation& of all treatment for patients with \ntype2DM. \nMost Intensive \nLoos,_ \nI.wt'\"\"\"\"\"\") \n7.0% \n8.0% \nI \n6.0% \nP8YChoaocloaconomlc conaldar~ \nHighly motivated, adherent, \nknowledgeable, excellent \nself-care capacities and \ncomprehensive support systems \nLo\nLess motivated, nonadherent, \nllmHed Insight, poor self-care \ncapacities, and weak \nsupport systems \nHypog!)lcamla J \nModerate \nHigh \nPatientaae:J \n~ \n~ \n~ \n~ \noo \n~ \nro \n~ \nDisease duralon, J \n10 \n20 \nOther cornorbid CondltiOl1:] \nNone \nFeor mild \nMuHiple or severe \nEstablished vaacular comp~ \nNone \nEarly mlcrovascular \nAdvanced mlcrovascular \nFigure 12-1.

Choosing a medication to treat type 2 DM (Table 12-10) \n~ \nMetformin is the preferred initial therapy in \ny \nmost patients with type 2 DM. \n1. Most studies compare an agent to placebo, so direct \ncomparison data are limited. \n2. 75% of patients require more than 1 drug by 9 years; \nthere is no evidence that any specific combination is better \nthan another, although agents that reduce cardiovascular \nevents are the recommended second agents in patients with \nestablished vascular disease. \n3. Consider starting metformin plus a second agent in \npatients who have an Hb~c > 9%. \n4. Patients with DKA., hyperosmolar hyperglycemic \nstate (HHS), or an HbA10 > 10% should be given \ninsulin as the initial therapy, although some patients \nmay eventually be able to stop insulin and reach goal \nwith oral agents. \nS. Using insulin to manage type 2 DM \na. Beta cell function declines over time in type 2 DM, so \nmany patients will eventually need insulin. \nb. The first step is to add long-acting basal insulin to oral \nagents, titrating the insulin dose to the fasting blood \nsugar. \nc. If the HbA1c target is not achieved, options include \nadding a rapid-acting insulin, such as lispro, with meals, \nswitching to twice daily biphasic insulin, or adding a \nGLP-1 receptor agonist. \nd. Sulfonylureas should be stopped when short-acting \ninsulins are used because of increased hypoglycemia. \nTreatment of Hypertension \nMost patients should be treated to a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg. A \ngoal of< 130/80 mm Hg can be considered in patients with a high \nrisk of cardiovascular disease if it can be achieved without excessive \nside effects. See Nephropathy section and Chapter 23, Hyperten-\nsion for details. \nTable 12-10.

Metformln \ntherapy should be maintained, whereas other oral agents may be discontinued on an individual basis to avoid unnecessarily complex or costly regimens \n(ie, adding a fourth antihyperglycemic agent.) \n'Note: In patients with established cardiovascular disease, the American Diabetes Association norecommends liraglutide or empagliflozin as the second agent. \nDPP+i, dipeptidyt peptidase-4 inhibitor; GLP-1-RA. glucagon-like peptide-1-receptor agonist; HbA,~ hemoglobin A,~ SGLT-2-i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. \n\nTreatment of Hypercholesterolemia (see \nChapter 23, Hypertension for additional detail) \nA. All patients with DM should be counseled regarding lifestyle \ntherapy for hypercholesterolemia (exercise, weight loss, reduc-\ning saturated and trans fat intake, increasing intake of plant \nsterols and viscous flber). \nB. Patients younger than 40 years with no ASCVD risk factors \n(LDL cholesterol ~ 100 mg/dL, hypertension, smoking, chronic \nkidney disease, albuminuria, or family history of premature \nASCVD) do not need treatment beyond lifestyle therapy. \nC. Patients younger than 40 years with risk factors or ASCVD \nshould take high-dose statins. \nD. Patients aged 40-75 years without risk factors should take \nmoderate-dose statins; those with risk factors or ASCVD \nshould take high-dose statins. \nE. Patients over 75 years should take moderate- to high-dose \nstatins, if tolerated. \nF. The ADA recommends that high-risk patients with a history \nof ASCVD who cannot tolerate high-dose statins should take \nmoderate-dose statins plus ezetimibe. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. G is a 56-year-old African American man with diabetes, \nchronic hepatitis B. CAD status post Ml 2 months ago, \nhypertension, and a history of stroke 1 year ago. He Is tak-\ning many medications, Including Humulln 70/30 20 units \ntwice dally, metoprolol, aspirin, atorvastatln, llslnoprll, furo-\nsemide, and ribavirin. Despite all of these problems, he has \nbeen slowly improving and reported at his last visit 3 weeks \n<i90 that he had recently given up his walker for a cane. Today \nyou are paged by his sister. who reports that Mr. G is very \nweak and cannot get up; his home glucose monitor reading \nIs \"critical high.\" Mr. G's voice Is barely recognizable over the \nphone. and he is unable to respond to your questions. You \nadvise his sister to call 911. \nAt this point, what ie the leading hypothHie, \nwhat ans the active altsmatlvse, and le \nthere a must not miss diagnosls1 Given this \ndlffsl\"flntial dlagnoele, what tsets should be \nort.lsrsd1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe differential diagnosis at this point is very broad and difficult \nto organize. It is helpful to recognize that Mr. G appears to be \nsuffering from the syndrome of delirium and to use the framework \nfor delirium to organize your thinking (see Chapter 11, Delirium \nand Dementia). It is also reasonable to consider Mr. G's underlying \nchronic medical problems as important clinical clues and initially \nfocus on the serious complications of these conditions; in other \nwords, initially focus on diseases for which he has a high pretest \nprobability: \n1. Diabetes: DKA, HHS, infection with or without sepsis. \nDIABETES I 229 \nG. In patients with ASCVD whose LDL cholesterol is \n~ 70 mg/dL while taking maximally tolerated statin \ntherapy, adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor should \nbe considered. \nAnti platelet Therapy \nA. Low-dose aspirin (75-162 mg/day) is indicated for secondary \nprevention in all patients with cardiovascular disease. \nB. Low-dose aspirin is indicated for primary prevention in \npatients with diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk \n(ASCVD 10-year risk > 10%; see Chapter 2, Screening and \nHealth Maintenance for information on calculating risk). \nI. Patients with locardiovascular risk (10-year risk< 5%) \nshould not take aspirin for primary prevention; the risk of \nbleeding is higher than the potential benefit. \n2. Aspirin should be considered in patients with intermediate \nrisk (10-year risk of 5-10%). \nC. Clopidogrel, 75 mg/day, should be used in patients with \naspirin allergies. \n2.

They become \nextremely dehydrated, with reduction in urinary output, and have very \nhigh serum glucose levels, accompanied by alterations in mental status. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Epidemiology \n1. Risk factors include older age, nursing home residence, \ninability to recognize thirst, and lack of access to fluids. \n2. Mortality rate is 5-6%, compared to < 2% in patients with \nDKA. \nB. Pathogenesis \n1. Reduced effective insulin concentrations and a concomitant \nincrease in counterregulatory hormones lead to increased \nhepatic and renal glucose production and impaired glucose \nutilization in peripheral tissues. \n2. Glycosuria leads to an osmotic diuresis with loss of free \nwater in excess of electrolytes, leading to hyperosmolaliry. \n3. As volume depletion occurs, urinary output drops, and \nhyperglycemia worsens. \n4. Insulin levels are higher than in DKA and are adequate to \nprevent lipolysis and ketogenesis. \nC. Precipitating factors \nI. The 3 most common precipitants are infection, lack of \ncompliance with insulin, and first presentation of diabetes. \n2. Other precipitants include postoperative state, \ncerebrovascular accident, Ml, pancreatitis, alcohol \nabuse, trauma, thyrotoxicosis, and medications \n(eg, corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotic drugs \n[especially olanzapine and risperidone], total parenteral \nnutrition). \nD. Clinical manifestations \nI. History \na. Symptoms and signs usually evolve over several days or \neven weeks. \nb. Common findings include polyuria followed by decreased \nurinary output, polydipsia, fatigue, and weight loss. \nc. Abdominal pain generally does not occur in HHS, as it \ndoes in DKA. \nd. Neurologic manifestations \n(I) Lethargy and disorientation common \n(2) Focal neurologic findings, including seizures, \ncan occur with hyperglycemia and resolve with \nnormalization of serum glucose. \n(3) Changes in mental status correlate with the degree \nof hyperosmolarity. \n(a) 20-25% present with coma. \n(b) Coma is present in half of the patients with \neffective serum osmolality of~ 320 mOsm/L. \n(c) Must search for another cause of altered mental \nstatus if osmolality < 320 mOsm/L \n2. Physical exam \na. Hypothermia often seen resulting from peripheral \nvasodilation \nb. Signs of dehydration often seen (see Chapter 28, Acute \nKidney Injury) \nc. Tachycardia and hypotension suggest severe dehydration \nor underlying sepsis. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Typical total body water deficit is 20-25% (about 9 L). \nB.

Hamilton, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. C i5 a 35-year-old man who come5 to your outpatient \noffice complalni~ of 3 day5 of diarrhea. \n~~ \nWhat fe the differential dlagnoeie of dlarrhea7 \n~JI\"' Howould you frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nA first step in assessing diarrhea is to categorize the frequency \nand duration of bowel movements. Diarrhea is defined as at least \n3 loose bowel movements per day. Often patients and clinicians \nwill mislabd loose bowel movements as diarrhea solely because the \nstool is loose. If a patient does flt the clinical criteria for diarrhea, \nthe diarrhea can be fwther characterized as acute, persistent, or \nchronic. Acute diarrhea has a duration of less than 14 days, per-\nsistent diarrhea 14-29 days, and chronic diarrhea at least 30 days. \nThe differential diagnosis varies significantly based on the duration \nof symptoms. This chapter focuses specifically on diagnosis and \ntreatment of acute diarrhea. \nAcute diarrhe:a can be further subcategorized into infectious \nand noninfectious causes, with infectious causes accounting for the \nmajority of cases of acute, self-limited diarrheal illnesses. \nSeveral factors are important in reasoning through a case of \nacute diarrhea including (1) associated signs and symptoms, \n(2) duration of symptoms, (3) exposure history, (4) history of \nimmunosuppressive conditions, and (5) epidemiology of specific \ninfectious pathogens. \nA detailed history of symptoms and exposures hdps guide the \nevaluation and treatment of acute diarrhea. Noninfectious diarrhea \nis typically characterized by lack of constitutional symptoms and \npresence of a culprit medication, supplement, food, or other con-\ndition (eg, pancreatic insufficiency). Therefore, taking a thorough \nhistory of medications, supplements, diet, and underlying medical \nconditions is essential to prioritize an initial differential diagnosis \nfor acute diarrhea. \nInfectious diarrhea can be associated with symptoms such as \nfever, myalgias, severe abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and \nstool with blood or mucus. However, lack of any of these symptoms \ndoes not rule out a diagnosis of infectious diarrhea. Symptoms of \ninfectious diarrhea may also suggest whether the diarrhea origi-\nnates in the large or small bowel, which can narrothe likelihood \nof specific pathogens. Patients with large volume, watery bowel \nmovements, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, bloating, and \ngas are more likely to have gastroenteritis and the pathogens most \ncommonly associated with this condition. Mucus or blood in the \nstool is rarely present in gastroenteritis. In contrast, patients with \ntenesmus and passage of many small-volume stools with blood \nand/or mucus are more likely to have colitis and the pathogens \nmore commonly associated with this condition. \nFigure 13-1 presents a clinical algorithm and a broad differen-\ntial diagnosis using this framework. \nA.

In this case, the prob-\nlem could be called acute-onset, watery diarrhta, or even acute-onset \ngastroenteritis. Correspondingly, the differential diagnosis should \nfocus on causes of acute diarrhea and gastroenteritis. The presence of \nconstitutional symptoms and the lack of concurrent medical condi-\ntions, offending foods, supplements, and medications make causes of \nnoninfectious diarrhea much less likely. When prioritizing a differen-\ntial diagnosis, assessing the epidemiology, or frequency of diagnoses \nin the population of interest, is hdpful. In cases of acute diarrhea, \nat least 87% result from infectious causes. Therefore, based on the \nepidemiology of acute diarrhea, an infectious etiology is more likely. \nThe presence of nausea and vomiting and lack of colitis-associated \nsymptoms of mucous, blood, and tenesmus makes pathogens that \ncause gastroenteritis more probable. \nTo prioritize the differential diagnosis, a thorough travel, expo-\nsure, medical, and sexual history is essential. International travd is \nespecially important given the regional differences in epidemiology \nof infectious pathogens. Exposure history should include detailed \ndietary history, water exposures through drinking or swimming, \nhealthcare exposure, antibiotic exposure, contact with animals, \nknown sick contacts, and exposure to childcare settings. Table 13-1 \nlists specific exposures and corresponding pathogens. Past medical \nhistory should focus on known history of immunocompromising \nconditions, medications, or history of past infections that would \nraise suspicion of an immunocompromising condition such as \nHIV.

Transmission \n1. Norovirus is easily transmissible via the fecal-oral route, \nairborne droplets, food, and fomites. \n2. Norovirus is the most common cause of foodhorne \ndiarrhea, and numerous outbreaks have been reponed in \nrestaurants, catered events, and cruise ships. \n3. Norovirus is very stable in the environment, resisting \nchlorine and alcohol disinfectants. \n4. Attack rates as high as 50% have been documented in \noutbreaks. \nD. Incubation petiod is 1-2 days. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. In almost all cases, norovirus should he diagnosed clinically \nbased on consistent symptoms as well as ruling out exposures \nor risk factors that would make diagnostic testing necessary. \nB. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is available to \nconfirm a diagnosis, hut testing should he reserved for public \nhealth investigations and in patients who have reasons for \ndiagnostic testing (see Figure 13-1). \nC. PCR is available as a part of some molecular multipathogen \nstool panels, which are increasing in clinical use. However, \ntesting should not be performed as most cases of norovirus can \nhe diagnosed clinically. \nTreatment \nA. Supportive care \n1. Most patients with acute diarrhea require only supportive \ncare. Supportive care is meant to provide rehydration and \nsymptom rdief. \n2. Rehydration \na. Oral rehydration is generally sufficient. \nb. For patients with mild diarrhea and little volume \ndepletion, oral fluids (eg, spans drinks, pediatric \ndectrolyte drinks, and soup broth) are appropriate \nrehydration. \nc. For patients with more significant volume depletion, oral \nrehydration solutions should contain NaCl, KCl, HC03 \nor citrate, and glucose. The World Health Organization \noral rehydration solution has the following composition: \n(1) Sodium: 75 mmol/L \n(2) Chloride: 65 mmol/L \n(3) Glucose: 75 mmol/L \n(4) Potassium: 20 mmol/L \n(5) Citrate: 10 mmol/L \nd. If this solution is not available, patients can he \ninstructed to mix the following in 1 L of water \n(1) One-half teaspoon of salt \n(2) One-quarter teaspoon of baking soda \n(3) 8 teaspoons of sugar \nc. In patients who cannot tolerate oral rehydration or who \nare very volume depleted, intravenous fluids (lactated \nRinger solution or normal saline) are indicated. \n3. Antidiarrheals (such as loperarnide) are safe and effective \nfor patients without bloody diarrhea (dysentery) or concern \nfor C difficile infection. Using antidiarrheals in a patient \nwith dysentery or C difficile may lead to: \na. Prolonged fever \n\nb. Toxic: mega1:olon and colonic: perforation \nc. Hemolytic: uremic syndrome in patients with Shiga \ntoxin-producing E coli (STEC). \n4. Antiemetics \ns. Diet \na. BRAT diet (banana, rice, applesauce, toast) is often \nrecommended. \nb. Dairy produets should be avoided. (See discussion bdow). \nB. Antimicrobial therapy \n1. Treatment other than supportive care is not necessary for \nnorovirus-like illnesses. \n2. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is recommended fur diarrheal \ninfections only in limited circumstances (see Figure 13-1). \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nAt the time of the patient's initial visit he was beginning \nto feel better. He still noted an \"upset stomach\" and was \nhaving watery diarrhea every 2-3 hours. He had not had \nany vomiting In about 6 hours and was able to tolerate \nfluids. \nHave you crossed a dlagnoetlc: threshold \nfor the leading hypotheele, norovlru91 Have \nyou ruled out the active alternatives? Do \nother tests need to t1e done to exc:luds the \nalternative dlagnoeH1 \nIn this case, given the classic symptoms, childcare exposure, and \nepidemiologic likelihood of norovirus as a cause of community-\nacquired gastroenteritis, it is the most likely diagnosis. The clini-\ncal history, lack of suspicious exposures, and the lower frequency \nof other causes in community-acquired gastroenteritis (see \nTable 13-3) make other causes less likely. Although toxin-mediated \ngastroenteritis is a consideration, there is no commercially available \nTable 13-3. Infectious causes of diarrhea in the United States. \nEstimated Annual \n% Infections that are \nOrganism \nNumber of CaHs1 \nFoodborne \nNorovirus \nSalmonella \nCampylobacter \nSTEC \nShlgella \nGiard/a \nCryptosporidium \nVlbrlo \nStaphylococcus \nClostrldlum \n' Rounded to nearest 10.000. \nSTEC, Shiga toxin-producing E coli. \n5.46million \n1.02 million \n850,000 \n180,000 \n130,000 \n80,000 \n60,000 \n50,000 \n240,000 \n970,000 \nDIARRHEA, ACUTE I 237 \ndiagnostic testing, and treatment is supponive. There are sporadic: \ncases of other causes of infectious diarrhea such as Salmonella, but \nalmost all of these infections resolve spontaneously. No diagnostic \ntesting is warranted in this case due to lack of severe symptoms or \nrisk factors for complication. In fact, only 2-15% of tests for bac-\nterial pathogens are positive and only 0.4--0.7% of tests for ova and \nparasites are positive in resource-rich settings. Patients and settings \nthat indicate need for evaluation include the following: \nA. Patients with bloody diarrhea \nB. Outbreak is suspected \nC. Patients at high risk for infecting others, including: \n1. Residents of long-term-care facilities \n2. Daycare workers \n3. Food service workers \n4. Healthcare workers \nD. Patients with severe disease (dehydration, toxic appearance, \nhigh fever) or risk factors for poor outcome (immunosuppres-\nsion, severe comorbid illnesses). \nE. Patients with prolonged diarrhea (>7 days) \nMust not miss diagnoses include those that would indicate \na more significant predisposing immunosuppressive condition \nthat could progress if not diagnosed (eg, HIV). Other must not \nmiss diagnoses are infections that would present a public health \nconcern in people who have the potential to easily spread them \nsuch as healthcare workers, childcare workers, and food han-\ndlers. Finally, other must not miss diagnoses include those that \ncould progress rapidly to life-threatening infections, including \nC difficile, Vibrio species, and enteric fever caused by Salmonella \ntyphi and Salmonella paratyphi. However, in almost all cases, these \ndiagnoses can be ruled out by a careful history, and additional \ntesting is not warranted unless associated characteristics and risks \nare identified. \nIn this case, no compelling reason for diagnostic testing or \ntreatment is present. \nIn most patients with an acute diarrhcal illness, \ndiagnostic testing is not helpful to the patient \nbut may be important from a public health \nstandpoint. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Toxin-Mediated \nGastroenteritis \nTatbook Presentation \nThe presentation of this syndrome, most commonly caused by \nS aureus or C perfringms, usually includes acute-onset vomiting \nand crampy abdominal pain. Vomiting is the predominant symp-\ntom with diarrhea being mild and watery. If present, fever is only \nlograde. Because of the very short lag between ingestion and \nillness (1-16 hours), the culprit meal is usually the last one eaten. \nRecovery is very rapid (12-48 hours). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Toxin-mediated gastroenteritis (often referred to as food \npoisoning) is not an infection; it occurs when a preformed \ntoxin, produced by bacteria, is ingested. \nB. Although S aureus, B emus, and C perfringms are the \nmost common causes of toxin-mediated gastroenteritis, \nthey account for only about 1 % of foodborne diarrheal \nillnesses. \n1. Viral causes account for most foodborne infections. \n\n238 I CHAPTER 13 \nTable 13-4.

Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E coli are the most common \nbacterial causes of foodbome infections. \nC. S aureus, C perfringrns, and B cereus can often be recognized \nby the clinicaJ and exposure history. Table 13-4 describes the \nclinicaJ syndromes of these infections. \nIllnesses presenting with the acute onset of \nvomiting and constitutional symptoms, often \nwith abdominal cramping, are usually caused \nby viruses or bacteria that elaborate toxins. \nEvidence--Based Diagnosis \nA. There are no diagnostic tests for toxin-mediated gastroenteritis \navailable for routine clinicaJ use. \nB. Toxin-mediated gastroenteritis should be considered in any \npatient with acute gastrointestinal symptoms and recent \nsuspicious food intake. \nTreatment \nTreatment is supportive care. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis \nCaused by Salmonella Species \nTextbook Presentation \nThe onset of disease is usually subacute with nausea, fever, and \ndiarrhea. Fever and nausea often resolve over 1-2 days while diar-\nrhea persists for 5-7 days. Patients usually have watery diarrhea \nwith 6-8 bowel movements each day. Salmonella gastroenteritis \nmay cause higher fevers than viral or preformed toxin disease. \nDysentery {characteriud by the passage of blood and mucus often \nwith tenesmus and fever) may occur. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Salmonella species cause 3 major types of disease. \n1. Diarrheal illnesses \na. Gastroenteritis \n(1) Most common Salmonella-related disease in the \nUnited States \n(2) Estimated annual incidence of Salmonella: \n1.23 million cases \nb. Dysentery \n2. Bacteremia \na. Develops in approximately 5% of patients \nb. Endovascular infections and osteomyelitis may \ncomplicate bacteremia. \nLasts 1-2 days \n3. Typhoid {enteric) fever \na. A systemic illness characterized by fever and abdominal \npain caused by Salmonella enterica of both typhi and \nparatyphi serotypes. \nb. It is distinct from gastroenteritis, which is caused by \nnontyphoidal Salmonella. \nc. Not generally considered a diarrheal illness; however, \ndiarrhea may be predominant symptom in some \npatients. \nd. While typhoid fever is a major problem worldwide, in \nthe United States, it is seen most often in unvaccinated \ntravelers. \ne. Typhoid fever should be considered in the differential \ndiagnosis of a traveler with a febrile illness. \nTyphoid fever should be suspected in returning \ntraveler with a fever. Diarrhea is not necessarily \npart of the clinicaJ presentation. \nB. Non-typhi Salmonella is transmitted by: \n1. Food \na. Eggs and poultry are most common sources. \nb. There are reports of infection from almost any type of \nfood. \n2. Fecal-oral contact with infected patients \na. Person-to-person transmission is less common than \ninfection from contaminated food. \nb. Bacteria commonly remain in the stool for 4-5 weeks \nafter infection. \n3. Animals (reptiles and poultry) known to carry Salmonella \nspecies. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosis of Salmonella gastroenteritis is made by stool culture \nor multipathogen molecular assay. \nB. Multipathogen molecular assays \n1. Sensitivity for Salmonella of79-96% and specificity of \n100%. \n2. Results are generally available faster than those from stool \nculrure. \nC. Stool culture \n1. Still considered the gold standard because sensitivity is close \nto 100%. \n2. Remains the only method of performing susceptibility \ntesting in patients that require treatment. \n\nD. Understanding local laboratory protocols is important to \ndetermine what tests are performed when a stool culture is \nordered. \nTreatment \nA. Prevention: Cooking food at adequate temperatures and good \nhand washing practices prevent most infections. \nB. Treatment \n1. Most Salmone/14 infections require no treatment. \n2. The patients who should receive therapy beyond supportive \ncare are those who have: \na. Severe disease (dehydration, dysentery, high fever) \nb. lmmunocompromised status \nc. Age greater than 65 years \nd. Confirmed or high risk of disseminated infection \n(1) Bacterernia \n(2) Prosthetic joints or hardware \n(3) Sickle cell anemia \ne. Typhoid fever \nC. Although most patients shed bacteria for weeks after infection, \nantibiotics should not be used in attempts to prevent transmis-\nsion. Antibiotics do not shorten the duration of carriage. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. C was sent home with directions for oral rehydration. \nHe reported sleeping for most of the afternoon and was \nwell enough to retum to work the next day. By the following \nday (day 4 of the presentation), the patient was com-\npletely better. He reported that none of h Is close contacts \nbecame Ill. \nThe patient's symptoms lasted 48-72 hours. He required no spe-\ncific therapy. There were no suspicious food exposures and nobody \nelse became ill. The case is consistent with a viral gastroenteritis \nsuch as that caused by norovirus. The lack of a suspicious diet \nhistory makes a toxin-induced foodborne illness (food poisoning) \nless likdy. \nFOLLOW-UP OF MR. C \n\nTwo weeks later Mr. C comes to see you again. He attrib-\nutes his rBCOvery to antibiotics that he took on the day he \nsayou. (The antibiotics were left over from a prescription \nhe was given for a dental Infection.) About 5 days after his \nrecovery, he began to feel poorly again. For the last 10 days \nhe has had diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and belching. He \ndenies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, ortenesmus. There has \nbeen no blood In his stool. \nAt this point, what Is the leading hypothHls, \nwhat are the active altsmatlvse, and le \nthere a must not miS& diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnosis, what tsete should be \nordered? \nDIARRHEA, ACUTE I 239 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nKey elements in the patient's current presentation include the \n10-day duration of the symptoms, lack of constitutional symptoms, \nrecent gastrointestinal illness, and recent exposure to antibiotics. \nThese key features suggest that both infectious and noninfectious \ncauses should be considered. Both the duration of symptoms and \nthe recent gastroenteritis should raise the possibility of lactose \nintolerance. Lactose intolerance is common after gastroenteritis \ndue to injury to the small bowel mucosa. Other potential diagno-\nses include recurrent gastroenteritis, side effect of the antibiotic, \nand C difficile infection. Recurrent infectious gastroenteritis can \noccur since many of the bacteria that cause diarrhea can persist \nin the stool after clinical symptoms have resolved. This fearure is \nespecially common with Salmone/14 and Campy/obacter. Antibiotics \nalso have been associated with a paradoxical prolonged carriage rate \nespecially in non-typhoidal Salmone/14 infections, possibly due to \ntheir effect on the intestinal mkrobiome. \nDiarrhea is also a common side effect of antibiotics and compli-\ncates as much as 25% of antibiotic courses. Given the recent anti-\nbiotic exposure, C difficile infection should also be considered. The \nprolonged nature of the illness should prompt consideration of the \nless typical pathogens, such as parasites, but if testing is considered \nnecessary, it should focus on pathogens that may be endemic to \nthe specific regions of exposure. Table 13-5 reviews the differential \ndiagnosis for this presentation. A targeted history focused on asso-\nciation with milk and milk-containing foods or nemedications as \nwell as any neexposures or symptoms will help further prioritize \nthe differential diagnosis. \nTable 13-5.

He ran out after these 3 doses. The \nonset of the c:liarrhea occurred after completlng the anti-\nbiotics. He has not traveled since his Infection and does \nnot note any unusual exposures. He reports that he had \nkept to the \"BRAT diet\" for a couple c:lays after recovery, \nl:lut started to reintroduce more cereal. rice, potatoes, milk, \nand yogurt as he began to feel better. \n~ \nle the clinical information eufflclsnt to maks a \n1~Jll\"' dlagno5l51 If not, what other Information do \nyou nel'Jd1 \nLeading Hypothesis: Lactose Intolerance \nTextbook Presentatlon \nLactose intolerance commonly presents with symptoms of bdch-\ning, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea. Though usually chronic, \nthe symptoms may be acute or subacute in the setting of recent \ninfection or dietary changes. Symptoms are associated with intake \nof milk or milk-containing products. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Lactase is the enzyme that metabolizes lactose. \n1. Rarely, it can be deficient at birth. \n2. More commonly, it can become deficient with age. \nB. It is thought that some ethnicities evolved persistent lactase \nactivity because of the importance of milk products as a \ncalorie source in their environments. \nC. Lactose intolerance can be caused by lactase deficiency or \nlactose malabsorption. \n1. Acquired lactase deficiency is most common in people of \nAsian, African, Middle East, Mediterranean, and Native \nAmerican ancestry. \n2. Secondary lactose malabsorption can occur in the setting \nof underlying bowel diseases, small intestinal bacterial \novergrowth, and infection of the small bowel. This process \nis more common in people with lolevels of lactase \nactivity at baseline. \nLactose intolerance after episodes of gastroen-\nteritis has been reported as high as 50-70% but \nfrequency depends on patient ethnicity. \nD. Milk, ice cream, and yogurt have the highest levels of lactose. \nE. Foods with high lactose and lofat (skim milk) tend to cause \nthe most symptoms as these foods deliver lactose to the small \nintestine the fastest. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of lactose intolerance is made clinically based \non a consistent history and resolution of symptoms on a \nlactose-free diet. \nB. More definitive tests, including lactose tolerance test or lactose \nbreath hydrogen test, can be performed in patients in whom \nthe diagnosis is likely but not clear historically. \n1. False-negative testing can occur in setting of recent \nantibiotic use. \n2. False-positive testing can occur in the setting of small \nintestinal bacterial overgrowth. \nTreatment \nA. Lactose intolerance is treated by decreasing lactose intake. \nB. Enzyme supplementation with lactase is often helpful in \npatients with chronic symptoms. \nC. In post-gastroenteritis lactose malabsorption, lactase activity \nwill eventually recover when the intestinal brush border \nregenerates. \nD. Because of the high prevalence of mild lactose intolerance and \nthe frequent exacerbation following gastroenteritis, patients \nwith acute: gastroenteritis should be advised to avoid dairy \nproducts for 2 weeks after recovery. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nOn exam he appears well. Vital signs are all normal. His \nal:ldomlnal exam reveals hyperactive bowel sounds with \nminimal distention. His al:7domen is soft anc:I nontender. \nRectal exam reveals soft, brown, heme-negative stool. \nHavs you croeesd a diagnoetic threehold for \nthe leading hYPoths&le, lactoee lntolsrance1 \nHave you ruled out the active altl'Jrnativss1 \nDo other teete nHd to bs dons to ncluds the \nalternative diagn051'J51 \nLactose intolerance is most likely, given the high incidence of this \ncondition in patients following episodes of gastroenteritis as well \nas the history of association with reintroduction of dairy products. \nThe patient is less likely to have an infectious cause of diarrhea \ndue to lack of constitutional signs and symptoms. Although anti-\nbiotic side effect should be considered, diarrhea from this cause \ntypically resolves soon after cessation of the antibiotic. Another \nconsideration in a patient who has had a recent antibiotic exposure \nis C difficile infection. Given the duration of symptoms of greater \nthan 7 days, diarrhea caused by a parasitic infection becomes more \nof a consideration, but is still unlikely given the loprevalence in \nthe United States. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Antibiotic Side Effect \nTatbook Presentation \nPatients with diarrhea as a side effect of antibiotics typically have \nwatery diarrhea during a course of antibiotics. Upper abdominal \nsymptoms of nausea and vomiting are rare and systemic symptoms \nshould be absent. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Diarrhea complicates up to 25% of antibiotic courses. \nB. Although any antibiotic can be associated with diarrhea, those \nmost commonly responsible for diarrhea are: \n\n1. Clindamycin \n2. Cephalosporins \n3. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate \nC. Patients with diarrhea caused by side effects of antibiotics usu-\nally have mild disease that occurs either during or immediately \nafter a course of antibiotics. Possible causes of this type of \ndiarrhea are numerous: \n1. Change in intestinal flora \n2. Nonantimicrobial effect of antibiotics such as the \npromotility effects of erythromycin. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diarrhca due to antibiotic use is more likely when certain \nfeatures are present: \n1. History of previous diarrhea associated with antibiotics \n2. Mild to moderate symptoms \nB. Symptoms almost always resolve shortly after discontinuation \nof antibiotics. \nTreatment \nA. Diarrhea as a side effect of antibiotic use usually resolves with \ndiscontinuation of antibiotics. \nB. Pro biotic agents may reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated \ndiarrhea and may shonen an episode once it has occurred. \nC. Antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide can provide \nsymptomatic relief. \nAlternative Diagnosis: C difficile Infection \nDisease Highlights \nA. C difficile accounts for 10-20% of diarrhea in the setting of \nrecent antibiotic exposure. \nB. C difficile causes diarrhea via toxin-mediated effects on the \nlarge bowel, which can present with severe diarrhea, often with \nabdominal pain and leukocytosis. \nC. Risk factors for C difficile include advanced age, hospitaliza-\ntion, antibiotic use, and proton pump inhibitor use. \n1. Although C difficile is classically associated with healthcare \nexposure, the incidence of community-associated C difficile \nis rising, with up to 41 % of all cases of C difficile being \ncommunity-associated in some areas. \n2. C diffidle should also be suspected in hospitalized patients \nwith unexplained leucocytosis. \n3. C difficile has been associated with almost every antibiotic. \nThose associated with the highest risk of C difficile include \nclindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-\ngeneration cephalosporins. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \n1. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become the diagnostic \nstandard with sensitivity ~ 90% and specificity ~ 97%. \nPCR can be performed alone or using an algorithm that \nincludes screening with enzyme immunoassay for glutamate \ndehydrogenase and toxins A and B. \n2. Diagnosis can also be confirmed by direct visualization \nof pseudomembranous colitis on colonoscopy or \nsigmoidoscopy. \nDIARRHEA, ACUTE I 241 \n3. Culture, although highly sensitive and specific, is not \nfrequently used because it is sloand because it also isolates \nnon-toxin-producing strains of C difficile that are not \nclinically relevant. \nTreatment \nA. 2018 guidelines recommend oral vancomycin or fldaxomicin \nfor initial episodes of C difficile. \nB. Relapse complicates 20-25% of cases of treated C diffidk. \n1. An initial relapse should be treated with vancomycin or \nfldaxomicin. \n2. For subsequent recurrences, various regimens arc \nrecommended including prolonged courses of oral \nvancomycin with a taper, use of fldaxomicin, or fecal \nmicrobiota transplantation. \nC. Surgical therapy, such as colectomy, is sometimes necessary \nfor patients with perforation, toxic megacolon, or severe \ninfection. \nD. When possible, patients with C difficile infection should \ndiscontinue antibiotics. \nE. Antidiarrheal medications should be avoided because of risk \nof development of ileus or toxic megacolon. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Giardia lamblia \n(also known as Giardia intestinalis or \nGiardia duodena/is) \nTatbook Presentation \nGiardiasis can present as either acute or chronic diarrhea. It usu-\nally occurs in patients with exposure to infected water supplies, \nalthough person-to-person transmission can occur. Symptoms \nusually include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, bloating, \nflatulence, and foul-smelling stools. Fever is uncommon. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Giardia is the most common parasitic cause of diarrhea in the \nUnited States. \nB. Most infections in the United States result from \ningestion of contaminated water from streams and lakes \nbut can also be transmitted by foodborne and fecal-oral \nroutes. \nC. Incidence peaks annually during the summer and early fall \nwhen people most commonly participate in water sports and \ncamping. \nD. Although usually sporadic, there are occasional outbreaks \nrelated to contamination of bodies of water used for recreation \nand drinking supplies. \nE. Common symptoms \n1. Diarrhea occurs in 96% of cases. \n2. Weight loss is present in 62% of cases. \n3. Abdominal cramps occur in 61 % of cases. \n4. Greasy stools are present in 57% of cases. \n5. Belching, flatulence, and foul-smelling stools are commonly \nreported. \nF. Fever is uncommon. \n\n242 I CHAPTER 13 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA. Enzyme immunoassay has a sensitivity of over 90%. \nB. Sensitivity of microscopic examination of stool for ova is \n50-70% for 1 stool sample and 90% for 3 samples. \nTreatment \nA. The treatment of choice for G lamblia infection is oral \nmetronidazole. \nB. If a patient has recurrence or severe disease with Giardia, \nimmunosuppression (including HN infection or immuno-\nglo bulin deficiency) should be suspected. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT W \nMr. Vis a 35-year-old man who is admitted to your acute-\ncare hospital after presentit19 with 4 days of diarrhea. \nHe reports fi!:ellt19 tired and weak. He Is having 6-8 bowel \nmovements a day. He says that he has significant abclom-\nlnal pain. On the day of admission, he began to pass bloody \nstools. On physical exam, his vital signs are temperature, \n38.3C; BP, 130/84 mm Hg; pulse, 90 bpm; RR. 1 2 breaths \nper minute. He is orthostatic. His abdomen has hyperac-\ntive bowel sounds. It Is diffusely tender. without peritoneal \nsigns. H Is stool ls a mixture of loose brown stool and blood. \nAt thki point, what le the leading hypotheele, \nwhat are the active alternatives, and Is \nthere a muet not mf99 dfagnoele? Given thle \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests should be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe pivotal points in this case are the presence of bloody diarrhea, \nabdominal pain, and fever. Bacterial pathogens are much more \nlikely than other pathogens to cause bloody diarrhea. The bacteria \nthat commonly cause bloody diarrhea are Shige/Ja species, Campy-\nlobtJCter species, and E cali. Salmone/Ja species, Y enttrocolitica, and \nC di.lficile also may cause bloody diarrhea. Noninfectlous causes, \nsuch as ischemia or an initial presentation of inflammatory bowd \ndisease, should also be considered. \nClinically, it is impossible to differentiate, with certainty, \nbetween the different causes of bacterial diarrhea, but a careful his-\ntory focused on potential exposures and risk factors as wdl as the \nknowledge of the epidemiology of the relevant infections can hdp \nprioritize the differential diagnosis. Table 13-6 lists the differential \ndiagnosis. \n\nThe patient's diarrhea began 4 days prior to admission. \nThe dlarrhea was watery and was accompanied by abclom-\nlnal cramping. He also had a low-grade fever. On the day of \nadmission, he began to have blood In his stool. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nA Lactose-free diet was recommended for t he patient . PCR \ntesting for C difflcile was negative. The suspicion for a recur-\nrent bacterial Infection or a parasitic Infection was very low. \nThe patient began a lactose-free cllet ancl was better within \n3 days. After 2 weeks, he slowly reintroduced his usual diet \nwithout symptoms. \nTable 13-6.

He has not had any International \ntravel. He has sex wit h men only and et19a0es in anal recep-\ntive and anal insertive Intercourse. He has had three sexual \npartners in the past 6 mont hs and only occasionally uses \nbarrier protect ion. He has not eaten any undercooked meat \nor poultry, and he has not had any animal contact In t he \npast 6 months. \n~ \nle the cllnlcal Information eufflclent to make a \n1~,.-\ndiagnosis? If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \n\nLeading Hypothesis: Shigella lnfedion \nTextbook Presentation \nShigel/4 infection often presents with fever and constitutional \nsymptoms. Diarrhea is initially watery and may become bloody. \nThe diarrhea can be frequent. Tenesmus is often present. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Shigel/4 has been reported to be the most common cause of \nbloody diarrhea in the United States. \nB. There have been outbreaks of Shigel/a in people who engage in \nanal-genital or anal-oral sexual intercourse. \nC. Although there is a spectrum of disease, a patient who is \nsystemically ill with classic dysentery (frequent bloody stools \nwith tenesmus) is most likely to have Shigel/4 infection. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Similar to the case with Salmonel/4 (discussed earlier) both \nPCR testing (as part of multipathogen molecular panels) or \nstool culture can be used to diagnose Shigel/a. \nB. PCR testing is associated with high sensitivity (93-97%) and \nspecificity (98-100%) for detecting Shigeila species. \nC. Stool culture allows for susceptibility testing. Because of \nincreasing rates of antibiotic resistance, particularly in men \nwho have sex with men, culture should be performed in \naddition to molecular testing. \nD. Understanding local laboratory protocols is important to \ndetermine what tests are performed when a stool culture is \nordered. \nTreatment \nA. Shigel/a dysentery benefits from treatment, by shortening the \nduration of symptoms and decreasing bacterial shedding. \nB. Ciprofloxacin is a reasonable empiric treatment option, but \nselection of an antibiotic should be based on susceptibility \ntesting as well as knowledge of local resistance patterns in \ntarget populations as a result of increasing antibiotic resistance. \nAlternative Hypothesis: Campylobacter Infection \nTextbook Presentation \nPresenting symptoms of Campylobacter infection are usually \ndiarrhea and abdominal pain. The diarrhea is often profuse and \nwatery and preceded by fever. The fever usually resolves over the \nfirst 2 days of the illness, while the diarrhea and abdominal pain \nmay last 4--6 days. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Campylobacter species are among the most commonly isolated \nbacterial pathogens in patients with diarrhea and the second \nmost common causes of bloody diarrhea behind Shigel/a \nspecies. \nB. Campylobacter species can be carried by domestic animals such \nas birds and farm animals {eg, pigs), and they can be found in \nundercooked meat and poultry. \nC. Campylobacter rarely can be transmitted from person-to-person, \nincluding through genital-anal, oral-anal, and digital-anal \ncontact. \nD. Common aspects of the presentation are \n1. Constitutional symptoms, including fever, occur before \ngastrointestinal symptoms. \nDIARRHEA, ACUTE I 243 \n2. Bloody diarrhea may occur after 2-3 days of watery \ndiarrhea in a small percentage of patients. \n3. Diarrhea is often associated with abdominal pain and can \nbe severe, sometimes mimicking appendicitis. \nE. Campylobacter infection can rarely be associated with \nextraintestinal complications, such as reactive arthritis and \nGuillain-Barre syndrome. \nF. Bacteria commonly remain in the stool for 4-5 weeks and \nreinfection can occur. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Stool cultures with selective media for Campylobacter can \nmake the diagnosis, but sensitivity is lower compared to other \nbacterial pathogens (37-70%). \nB. PCR testing is increasing in clinical settings and has much \nhigher sensitivity (93-97%) for Campylobacter than culture; \nhowever, PCR testing does not provide susceptibility data, \nwhich can be performed only on positive cultures. \nTreatment \nOrganisms that are generally associated with \ndysentery (Shige/la, Campy/obacter, Shiga \ntoxin-producing E cols) are at least as likely to \ncause non-bloody diarrhea and a gastroenteritis-\ntype illness, so the absence of bloody diarrhea \ndoes not rule out these diagnoses. \nA. Most cases of Campylobacter infection do not require \nantibiotics and are self-limited. \nB. Patients with severe symptoms (see Figure 13-1) should be \ntreated with antibiotics. \nC. Fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotics can be used as \nempiric therapy, but resistance is increasing so choice should \nbe based on local susceptibility patterns and results of \nantibiotic susceptibility testing. \nAntidiarrheals should never be used for \npatients with dysentery or signs of invasive \ninfection (tenesmus, blood or mucus in stool, \nhigh fever, and severe abdominal pain). \nAlternative Diagnosis: Shiga toxin-producing \nE coli (STEC) \nTextbook Presentation \nSTEC usually presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain. The \npain is often worse in the right lower quadrant. Bloody diarrhea is \nvery common, while nausea, vomiting, and fever are not. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Nomenclature \n1. STEC is a strain of E cou that produces Shiga toxin. \n2. STEC is also called enterohemorrhagic E cou (EHEC). \n3. The most common strain of STEC in the United States is \n0157:H7. \n4. Other than STEC, there are 4 types of E coli that cause \ndiarrheal illness in adults. \na. Enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC) is a common cause \nof travders' diarrhea that causes symptoms through \nelaboration of a toxin. \n\n244 I CHAPTER 13 \nb. Enteropathogenk E coli (EPEC) is a common c:ause of \nwatery diarrhea in adults and children. \nc. Enteroinvasive E coli (EIEC) causes bloody diarrhea \nwith tenesmus similar to Shigell.a. \nd. Enteroaggregative E coli (EAEC) is a common cause of \ndiarrhea in children and travelers' diarrhea. \nB. STEC is most commonly associated with undercooked beef, \nbut it can also be found in fcc:ally contaminated food products \nsuc:h as produce, fruit products, and dairy products. \nC. STEC can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected \npeople and livestock. \nD. Symptoms of STEC include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, \nand absence of fever. \nE. STEC can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a con-\ndition that is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic \nanemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA Patients infected with STEC are significantly more likely than \npatients infected with other pathogens to: \n1. Repon bloody diarrhea and provide visibly bloody \nspecimens \n2. Lack fever \n3. Have abdominal tenderness \n4. Have a white blood cell count> 10,000/mc:L \nB. Positive culture for STEC, detection of Shiga toxin by \nimmunoassay, or detection of Shiga toxin gene by nucleic acid \nampliflc:ation testing is considered diagnostic. \n1. Selective culture media for STEC is required for growth. \n2. Multipathogen molecular testing panels have demonstrated \nhigh sensitivity (91-100%) and specificity (97-100%) for \nSTEC. \nC. Some microbiology laboratories perform testing for STEC \nwith routine stool testing, but culture and toxin testing \nfor STEC may need to be specifically requested in other \nmicrobiology laboratories. \nTreatment \nA Treatment of STEC is controversial. \nB. Antibiotics have demonstrated mixed results in studies, but \nthere is a concern for increased risk of HUS with their use. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr. V Is g lven Intravenous fl ulds (because of the orthostatlc \nhypotension) and acetaminophen.

Testing should be selective in order to \nfacilitate pathogen detection in groups that benefit the most, while \ndecreasing likelihood of false-positive testing. Details of testing \nstrategies are included in Table 13-7. \nMany laboratories are nousing multipathogen gastrointesti-\nnal panels, whic:h identify a range of bacterial, viral, and parasitic \ncauses of diarrhea from a single specimen. These tests are often \nmore sensitive than non-molecular tests and do not require clini-\ncians to order different tests for eac:h suspected pathogen. However, \nthese methods are not able to determine antibiotic susceptibility, so \nsome pathogens identified by these panels require a reflex culture. \nPatients who may benefit the most from treatment and are \nhighest yield for diagnostic testing include: \n\nA. Patients with severe illness (bloody stool, fever, severe \nabdominal pain, > 6 bowel movements per day, hypovolemia, \nand need for hospitalization); \nB. Specific exposures that increase risk of pathogens that \nbenefit from treatment (travel, high-risk sexual encounters, \nantibiotics); \nC. Patients with conditions that increase the risk of complications \n(immunosuppression, inflammatory bowel disease, pregnancy, \nand advanced age); and \nD. Situations with public health implications (confirmed \nor possible outbreak or patients who are at high risk for \nspreading disease, such as healthcare workers, food handlers, \nand childcare workers). \nIn the past, testing for fecal leukocytes has been recommended \nin the diagnostic work-up of acute diarrhea with the highest \nreported sensitivity for infectious or inflammatory diarrhea of \n71-73% and speciflcity of 79-84%. However, the performance \ncharacteristics are widely variable in different settings. In addition, \nthis test is not diagnostic of a particular infection and does not gen-\nerally change management or outcomes. Therefore, fecal leukocyte \ntesting should not be used routinely in the diagnostic work-up of \nacute diarrhea. Fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin are newer tests \nthat have been used for the diagnosis of inflammatory diarrhea, \nbut there is insufficient evidence to support their routine clinical \nuse for guiding the management and diagnostic testing for acute \ndiarrhea. \nAlthough Shigella infection is most likely in this case, diagnos-\ntic testing should be performed because other pathogens including \nCttmpylobacter and STEC are still possible, and the management of \nthese pathogens is different. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nThe patient was treated with supportive therapy. Antl-\ndlarrheals were withheld because of his bloody dlarrhea. \nCiproftoxacin was prescribed empirically due to his severe \nsymptoms. His stool was sent for multipathogen molecular \ntesting. which identified Shigel/a. Reflex culture greShigel/a \nflexnerlthat was susceptible to clproftoxacln. \nIn this case, the acute and bloody nature of the diarrhea allowed \nfor the differential diagnosis to be focused on specific pathogens \nusing the initial approach presented in this chapter. Epidemiologic \nfactors, symptoms, and exposures allowed for further focusing of \nthe differential diagnosis, which, in turn guided the appropriate \ndiagnostic and therapeutic monitoring. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nTravelers' Diarrhea \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with travelers' diarrhea usually become ill in the first \n5 days of their trip from resource-rich regions to resource-limited \nones. They usually have mild symptoms of a gastroenteritis-like \nillness. Patients are often better by the time they return home. \nDisease Highlights \nA. There are up to 10 million cases in the United States reported \nyearly. \nDIARRHEA, ACUTE I 245 \nB. The highest risk destinations for travelers' diarrhea are in Asia, \nAfrica, and South and Central America. \nC. The disease usually occurs in the first S days (with a peak \nonset at 4 days) and resolves in 1-5 days. \nD. Symptoms are usually mild to moderate but more severe \nsymptoms can occur. \nE. Although the predominant cause of travelers' diarrhea is \nenterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC), any bacteria, virus, or parasite \ncan be a causative pathogen. The local epidemiology of gas-\ntrointestinal pathogens is important to inform the differential \ndiagnoses in these cases. \nTreatment \nA. '-otioo \n1. Ensure dean water \na. Boiled, filtered, or chemically purifled local water or \nbottled water. \nb. Ice and mixed drinks can be made with contaminated \nwater. \nc. Ensure bottled water is sealed and not just bottled tap \nwater. \n2. Fruit, vegetables, and table-top sauces are also sources of \ntravelers' diarrhea. \n3. Gastric acidity is natural prevention; temporarily \ndiscontinue proton pump inhibitors or H 2 -blockers if safe \nto do so. \n4. Prophylactic antibiotics \na. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not typically recommended \nfor travders unless they are at very high risk \nfor complications, such as those with severe \nimmunosuppression or inflammatory bowel disease. \nb. Rifaximin, ciprofloxacin, or bismuth subsalicylate can \nbe used for prophylaxis in high-risk travelers. \nc. When used, antibiotics are at least 80% effective at \npreventing travelers' diarrhea, but there is increasing \nantibiotic resistance in many regions of the world. \nB. Treatment \n1. Antibiotics are effective at decreasing duration of symptoms. \na. Ciprofloxacin and azithromycin are the preferred agents, \nbut ultimate choice should depend on resistance rates in \nthe area of travel. \nb. Antibiotics should be provided to travelers to take at \nfirst signs of gastrointestinal symptoms. \n2. Consider causes of travelers' diarrhea other than ETEC \n(such as giardiasis, amebiasis), which require different \ntherapies, especially if symptoms do not respond to empiric \ntreatment. \nREFERENCES \nAdachi JA, Mathewson JJ, Jiang ZD, Ericsson CD, DuPont HL.

Stem, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. J is a 32-year-old man who comes to your office com-\nplaining of dizziness. \n~ \nWhat fe the differential dlagnoeie of \n1~Jll\"' dizzinees1 Howould you frame the \ndifferential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nDizziness may arise from diseases of the inner ear; central and \nperipheral nervous system; cardiovascular system; and occasionally, \npsychiatric conditions. This leads to an extensive differential diag-\nnosis. Fortunately, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed with \nan organized approach. The first pivotal step is to recognize that \nmost patients who complain of dizziness are actually complaining \nof 1 of 3 distinct symptoms: vertigo, near syncope, or dysequilib-\nrium. (Patients who are unable to dearly describe their dizziness, \nare referred to as having ill-defined light-headedness.) Identifying \nthe more specific symptom narrows the differential diagnosis and \nfocuses the evaluation. Therefore, the first step asks the patient \n\"What does it feel like when you are dizzy?\" (Figure 14-1). \nPatients must then be given enough time, without interruptions \nor mggestions, to describe their dizziness as dearly as possible. \nAdditionally, the event that triggers the symptom can also help \nclassify the symptom as vertigo, near syncope, or dysequilibrium. \nFor instance, dizziness that occurs when rolling over in bed or \nwith head movement suggests vertigo, upon standing suggests \nnear syncope, or when walking suggests dysequilibrium. It is also \nimportant to determine whether the symptom is constant or inter-\nmittent and to ask about other associated symptoms that may be \nimportant diagnostic clues (ie, other neurologic or cardiac symp-\ntoms). Table 14-1 summarizes chief complaints, triggers, other \nhistorical features, and differential diagnoses. \nAfter identifying the more precise symptom that the patient is \nexperiencing, the second pivotal step addresses these more specific \nsymptoms in detail. \nVertigo \nVertigo is a sense of spinning or motion and is the most com-\nmon type of dizziness. The differential diagnosis of vertigo is \nextensive and includes diseases of the peripheral nervous system \n(inner ear) and CNS (brainstem}. The most important task in \nthe evaluation of patients with vertigo is to identify patients with \n\"must not miss\" life-threatening central causes, including stroke, \nhemorrhage, tumors, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, the \nflnt pivotal step in the evaluation of patients with vertigo is to \nlook for dues on history and neurologic exam that suggest CNS \ndisease (Figure 14-2). Since the vestibular system resides in the \nbrainstem, central vertigo is often accompanied by other brain-\nstem or cerebellar findings, which is where the history and exam \nshould focus. Patients should be asked about CNS symptoms of \nnesevere headache or neck pain, symptoms of brainstem dys-\nfunction (dysarthria, diplopia, facial weakness}, symptoms of \ncerebellar dysfunction (ataltla or incoordination} and examined \nfor brainstem or cerebellar signs (dysconjugate gaze, facial weak-\nness, other cranial nerve abnormalities, abnormal gait, abnormal \nRomberg, dysmetria, or papilledema). The CNS exam should also \ncarefully look fur nystagmus. While many patients have physio-\nlogic endpoint nystagmus (a febeats of nystagmus on far lateral \ngaze), some types of nystagmus suggest a central etiology. These \ninclude the following: \n1. Bidirectional nystagmus refers to nystagmus that occurs both \nwhen the patient looks to the left anti to the right. (The fast \ncomponent goes to the left when the patient is looking left and \nto the right when the patient is looking right.) \n2. Nystagmus that is not inhibited by visual fixation on an object. \n3. Nystagmus that lasts > 1 minute or fails to fatigue with \nrepetition. \nTable 14-2 contrasts the features distinguishing central from \nperipheral vertigo. Any patient with unexplained CNS symptom(s} \nor sign(s} should have prompt evaluation of the brainstem, prefer-\nably with MRI. \nThe second pivotal step in vertiginous patients without obvi-\nous CNS symptoms or signs, reviews the time course of the vertigo \nas wdl as its trigger to determine the appropriate evaluation and \ndifferential diagnosis (Figure 14-3). \nThis is critical because surprisingly some patients with central \nvertigo do not have obvious CNS symptoms and signs and may \nnot be identified by that first pivotal step. A systematic evaluation \ncan nonetheless identify these patients. In particular, the precise \nduration of each episode of vertigo must be determined because this \ndramatically narrows the differential diagnosis. Although patients \nmay say that their vertigo started days ago, the follow-up question \nmust ascertain holong each individual episode lasts. Another key \nquestion is whether the vertigo is actually triggered by head move-\nment or simply mlllie worse by head movement. Almost all causes of \nvertigo are made worse by head movement but only some are acru-\nally precipitated/triggered by head movement. These two questions \n(episode duration and trigger) identify 3 distinct groups of patients \nwith vertigo (Figure 14-3). \nThe most 1:ommon group are patients with episodes of vertigo \nthat are very brief (typically< 1 minute} that are triggered by head \nmotion (anti absent while still). Virtually all such patients have \nbenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) that can be evaluated \nwith the Dix Hallpike maneuver (discussed below). \n\n248 I CHAPTER 14 \nDizziness \n\"What doea It feel lllre when you are dizzy?\" \nSpinning \nFalling \nFainting \nSN flgUl'8814-2 \nS..

The vertigo for these patients is typically \nmade worse by motion but is spontaneous and present even with-\nout motion. The differential diagnosis for such patients includes \nTIA, vestibular migraine, or Meniere disease. Useful clues in such \npatients include cardiovascular disease risk factors {suggesting \nTIA), a headache history {suggesting vestibular migraine), or a \nhistory of other auditory symptoms such as tinnitus or hearing loss \n(suggesting Meniere disease) (Figure 14-4). \nThe third group of patients has vertigo that is continuous for \ndays and made worse by motion. This syndrome is referred to as \nthe acute vestibular syndrome and may be caused by vestibular \nneuritis, stroke, or other CNS causes. A detailed approach to \nsuch patients is critical to detect small brainstem strokes that may \ninitially be subtle and yet lead to life-threatening complications. \nThe approach to the acute vestibular syndrome is discussed in \ndetail bdoand illustrated in Figure 14-5. \nAs mentioned above, many patients have other, nonvertiginous \ncauses of dizziness, including near syncope and dysequilibrium. \nNear Syncope \nThe differential diagnosis and approach to near syncope is covered \nin detail in Chapter 31. \nDysequilibrium \nDysequilibrium is the sensation of falling or imbalance associated \nwith difficulty walking or standing and can arise from abnormal-\nities of the brain, cerebellum, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. \nCommon causes include Parkinson disease, normal-pressure \nhydrocephalus, cerebdlar degeneration (eg, alcoholic cerebdlar \ndegeneration}, cerebellar stroke, vertebrobasilar insufficiency \n(VBI), vitamin B12 deficiency, tabes dorsalis, diabetes mdlitus, and \nmultiple sensory deficits. The cranial nerve, cerebellar, gait, and \nsensory exams may provide critical clues that help focus the diag-\nnosis. Gait disturbances may suggest Parkinson disease (shuffling \ngait) or cerebdlar disease (wide-based gait). Stocking glove sensory \ndeficits are typical of diabetic neuropathy; whereas loss of propri-\noception suggests posterior column disease (ie, vitamin B12 defi-\nciency, tabes dorsalis, and some compressive spinal lesions}. A \ndiagnostic approach is illustrated in Figure 14-6. \nIll-defined Light-headedness \nIn practice, many patients have difficulty describing their symp-\ntom and are referred to as having ill-defined light-headedness \n(Figure 14-1). Such patients may suffer from any of the aforemen-\ntioned disorders but cannot describe the symptom in a manner that \nallowi; it to be recognized. Others have nonspeciflc dizziness that \nmay be caused by depression, anxiety, or a medication. Patients \nwith ill-defined light-headedness should be asked about neurologic \nand cardiac symptoms and signs that may point to the involved \nsystem. For instance, dizzy patients with other CNS symptoms \nor signs (neheadache, double vision, ataxia, or diplopia) almost \ncertainly have CNS disease, whereas patients who note dizziness \nimmediately on standing associated with a drop in their BP almost \n\n250 I CHAPTER 14 \nVertigo triggered by motion, \nBrief episodes < 1 minute \n(But recurring for weeks) \nProbable BPPV \nSpontaneous vertigo \nMultiple episodes \nLasting minutes to hours (or days) \nEvaluate TIA, vesti>ular \nmigraine, Meniere disease \nSee Figure 14-4 \nSpontaneous vertigo \nMonophasic illness \nSymptoms for days \nAcute vestibular syndrome \nEvaluate for vestibular neuritis, \nstroke, or other CNS cause \nSee Figure 14-5 \nBPPV, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; CNS, central nervous system; TIA, transient ischemic attack. \nFigure 14-3.

See Figure 14-1. Patients with vertigo \ncomplain that either they or their surroundings are spinning. \nRecognizing that Mr. J is suffering from vertigo allows the exam-\niner to limit the differential diagnosis to the subset of diseases that \ncause vertigo (Table 14-1). \nAs noted above, the first pivotal step in the evaluation of \npatients with vertigo is to look for signs or symptoms that suggest \ncentral vertigo. Since these are must not miss diagnoses, a careful \nneurologic history and exam searching for cranial nerve or cerebel-\nlar findings is crucial (Figure 14-2). \n\nOn further questioning, Mr. J reports t hat he had a similar \nepisode 5 years ago. Other t han nausea, he has no other \n5ymptom5. Speclflcally, he ha5 not had definitive CNS \nsymptoms such as nesevere headache or neck pain, dlplo-\npla, numbness, weakness, dy5arthrla, or trouble walking. On \nphysical exam, he appears anxious. His vftal signs are BP. \n110/70 mm Hg; RR. 16 breaths per minute; pulse, 84 bpm; \ntemperature, 37.0\"C. HEENT exam reveals extraocular \nmuscles Intact wit h 15 beats of horizontal nystagmus on \nleft lateral gaze. This 5tops after repeating t he maneuver \nseveral times.

Given this and the lack of CNS signs and \nsymptoms, BPPV is the leading hypothesis. An alternative diagnosis, \nthat is much less likely given the duration of symptoms and lack of \ntinnirus or hearing loss would be Meniere disease. See Table 14-3. \nLeading Hypothesis: BPPV \nTextbook Presentation \nBPPV typically presents with the abrupt onset of severe dizziness. \nPatients often describe feeling like the room is spinning. They \noften note that the symptoms began when they rolled over in bed, \nTable 14-3.

Each episode is brief {lasting 10-20 seconds) rather than \npersistent {as in vestibular neuritis). However, since the episodes \noccur in clusters, patients often complain of vertigo that occurs \nfor days or weeks. A careful history can help make this distinction. \nSymptoms may recur years later. \n\n254 I CHAPTER 14 \nDetermining the duration of a single episode \nof vertigo is critical to establishing the correct \ndiagnosis. \nPatients with BPPV often complain of vertigo \nwith head motion. However, this is not diag-\nnostic of BPPV as many forms of vertigo are \nworsened with head motion. \nDisease Higblighu \nA. Most common cause of vertigo (17-42%) \nB. Vertigo typically precipitated by positional changes \n(rolling over in bed, looking up) \nC. Dizziness may also be worsened on standing. However, \nsymptoms that occur only on standing (and not rolling \nover, etc) suggests orthostatic dizziness {see below). \nD. Vertigo is brief, usually lasting < 15 seconds but may last as \nlong as 90 seconds. \nE. Patients typically have clusters of attacks over several weeks \nto 1 month and then remission. Recurrent clusters occur in \nabout half of patients. \nF. Secondary to a free-floating canalith usually within 1 of the \nsemicircular canals (usually the posterior semicircular canal). \nHead motion starts the canalith in motion that continues \nwhen the head stops. This creates turbulent flowithin the \nendolymph, resulting in the sensation of motion (vertigo}. \nThe precipitant is usually unknown, although BPPV may be \ncaused by labyrinthitis or head trauma. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \n'1. A. Patients with all 4 of the following criteria usually have BPPV \n(88% sensitive, 92% specific; LR+ 11, LR- 0.13): \n1. Recurrent vertigo \n2. Duration of attack < 1 minute \n3. Symptoms invariably provoked by changing head position \na. Lying down or turning over in bed or \nb. 2 of the following: Reclining the head, rising from \nsupine, or bending forward \n4. Not attributable to another disorder \nB. One study reported the following symptoms in patients with \nBPPV: \nI. All patients with BPPV complained that turning over in \nbed provoked the vertigo. \n2. 50% of patients complained of imbalance but falling was \nrare (only 1/61). Given the rarity of falling, this should \nraise the concern for another disorder. \nC. Nystagmus in BPPV \n1. Positional nystagmus is common. Changes in position \ncause movement of the canalith within the involved \nsemicircular canals, which triggers vertigo and may cause \nnystagmus. \n2. Spontaneous nystagmus is absent. (In spontaneous \nnystagmus, change in gaze without a change in head position \ntriggers nystagmus.) Spontaneous nystagmus should alert \nclinicians to alternative diagnoses. \nD. The Dix Hallpike maneuver can elicit nystagmus in patients \nwith suspected BPPV. \n1. The maneuver is only useful in patients with suspected \nBPPV (those with vertigo that is brief, positional, and \nwithout neurologic symptoms or spontaneous nystagmus) \nand could be confusing in other patients. \n2. Typical findings of nystagmus induced by the Dix Hallpike \nmaneuver in BPPV patients include \na. A latency period of 2-5 seconds between the time the \npatient's position is changed and the nystagmus begins. \nb. Nystagmus is brief (usually< 30 seconds), and fatigues \nwith repetition of maneuver. \nc. Nystagmus is usually mixed, with a rotary upward \nbeating. Occasionally, the nystagmus is horizontal or \nnot evoked at all. \n(1) Sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 94% \n(2) A superb video demonstrating the Dix Hallpikc \nand Epley maneuvers can be found at \nhttps:l/www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxD-lgqix-s. \nd. Alarm features that suggest a central (brainstem) \ndisorder include nystagmus that begins immediately \n(without a latency period), lasts longer than 1 minute, \nfails to fatigue, is not suppressed by visual fixation, or is \npurely vertical. \nE. CNS imaging should be performed in patients with findings \nthat suggest central disease and in patients with atypical \nfindings for BPPV, including patients with symptoms that \npersist or progress. \nTreatment \nA. Most patients recover regardless of therapy over 2-6 weeks but \nrecovery can take months. \nB. The Epley maneuver is a rotational maneuver that repositions \nthe canalith and is effective (56%) at stopping vertigo. \nC. Vestibular rehabilitation (a series of patient movements that \ntriggers central adaptation} is another option. \nD. Vestibular suppressants (meclizine and benwdiazepines) may \ncause drowsiness, worsen imbalance, and delay CNS adapta-\ntion and should be used only when necessary for patients with \nfrequent intolerable spells. \nE. Surgical options are available for patients with refractory \nsymptoms but are rarely necessary. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. J's history is characteristic of BPPV. At this point, the Dix \nHallpike maneuver should be performed to evaluate positional \nnystagmus. \n\nMr. J reports Intense vertigo with the maneuver. A mixed. \nupward beating nyetagmu5 i5 noted, which la5t5 for \n20 eecond5. After repeat ing the maneuver, the ny5tagmus \ndisappears. \nHavs you c::roessd a diagnostic; threshold for \nthe Isadlng hYPoths&le, 5PPV1 Havs you rulsd \nout ths actlvs altsrnatlvss? Do othsr tests \nnssd to be dons to sxc;lude the altsmatlve \ndiagnoses? \n\nThe dinkal history, exam, and lack of risk factors for CNS \ndisease or CNS signs all point to peripheral rather than central \nvertigo. The duration of each vertiginous episode suggests BPPV \nrather than vestibular neuritis or Meniere disease. The Dix \nHallpike maneuver is completely consistent with BPPV: Given \nthis, and the lack of tinnitus or hearing loss, further evaluation is \nnot necessary. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. D is a 40-year-old white man who complains of diz-\nziness. His past medical history is unremarkable except \nfor controlled hypertension. Detailed questioning reveals \nthat he has had a constant spinning sensation for the last \n3-4 days. He has no history of similar episodes or hearing \nloss. Altho~h head movement exacerbates the symptom, \nit is persistent even when he is still. \n~ \nAt this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \n1~Jll\"' wha\"t; are \"t;he active alumativH, and ie \nthsre a muet not mlH dlagnosie1 Given \"t;hie \ndlfferen\"t;lal diagnosis, what usts should be \norc:lerec:l1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \n& noted in the beginning of the chapter the first pivotal point \nin dizzy patients distinguishes vertigo from near syncope or dys-\nequilibrium (see Figure 14-1). Clearly, Mr. D is suffering from \nvertigo. The second step searches for CNS signs or symptoms \nthat might suggest central vertigo (Figure 14-3). This requires a \ncareful neurologic history and exam searching for cranial nerve or \ncerebellar findings. \nMr. D denies any history of slg nlftca nt headaches. He denies \nany history of prior or current neurologic complaints, such \nas dlplopla, visual loss. ataxia, or unexplained motor or sen-\nsory symptoms. He does note some intermittent nausea. \nOn physical exam his vital e;lgns are BP, 126/82 mm Hg; \npulse, 74 bpm; RR. 16 breaths per minute; temperature, \n37.0\"C. HEENT exam reveals that his pupils are equal, \nround, react to light and accommodation. Extraocular \nmovements are Intact. Neurologlc exam reveals normal gait, \nmotor strength, sensation, negative Romberg e;lgn, and \nintact cranial nervee;. \nMr. D has no obvious symptoms or signs to suggest central ver-\ntigo. & noted above, the next step in vertiginous patients without \nobvious CNS symptoms or signs is to reviethe time course of the \nvertigo as well as its trigger to determine the appropriate evaluation \nand differential diagnosis (see Figure 14-3). \nDIZZINESS I 255 \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nAn Epley maneuver is performed resulting in resolution \nof Mr. J's symptoms. One month later he returns and is \nfeeling well. \n\nMr. D repeat s that his vertigo has been present for days. \nHe reports that head motion makes It worse, but that it is \nalso present even while he is still. He has never had any prior \nsimilar eplsodt:s. \nUnlike our first patient Mr. J, Mr. D has vertigo that is con-\ntinuous, lasting for days and spontaneous (that is present even \nwithout head motion). Patients with a single prolonged episode \n(days) of spontaneous vertigo (present without motion) are clas-\nsified as having the acute vestibular syndrome. Its differential \ndiagnosis includes vestibular neuritis, stroke, and other CNS \ncauses (ie, MS). Of these, vestibular neuritis is the most com-\nmon and the leading hypothesis. Mr. D's history of hypertension \nincreases his risk of stroke, but his young age makes it less likely. \nHe has not had any prior symptoms suggestive of MS (eg, diplo-\npia, dysarthria, weakness) but this could still represent his initial \npresentation. Additionally, he has no history of cancer making \nmetastatk disease unlikely but a primary CNS neoplasm remains \npossible. Table 14-4 lists the differential diagnosis. \nTable 14-4.

A detailed approach to such patients is critical to \ndetect serious brainstem strokes or other processes that may be \nsubtle before progressing to life-threatening complications. Many \npatients with brainstem suokes or other serious brainstem disor-\nders can be rapidly identified by the aforementioned neurologic \nhistory, cranial nerve, and cerebellar exam. Severe gait instability, \nan inability to stand unaided, or any other neurologic signs or \nsymptoms warrant neuroimaging (usually with MRI). However, \nroughly 25% of patients with the acute vestibular syndrome \nhave suffered from a stroke and but lack obvious abnormalities on \na typical neurologic mJieof systmis, c~bellar and cranial nerve \nexam. The identification of these patients is greatly facilitated by \nthe HINTS examination. The components of the HINTS exam \nare the head impulse test, nystagmus, and tests of skedeviation. \nThis exam is highly sensitive at detecting strokes and other CNS \ncauses in patients with the acute vestibular syndrome (sensitivity, \n98%; specificity, 85%; LR+, 6.5; LR-, 0.02) and in fact even more \nsensitive for brainstem strokes than initial diffusion-weighted MRI \n(DW-MRI). Specifically, any of the following suggest a stroke or \nother CNS cause: (1) a normal head impulse test, (2) nystagmus \nthat is direction changing, or (3) vertical skedeviation. Each of \nthese is explained beloand can be seen at https://collections.lib. \nutah.edu/details?id= 177180 \nIn the head impulse test. the examiner holds the patient's head \nin their hands and asks the patient to focus on the examiner's sta-\ntionary nose. The examiner then rapidly mrns the patient's head \nwhile the patient tries to stay focused on the examiner's nose. In \npatients with an intact vestibular ocular reflex, the patient is able \nto maintain eye contact with the examiner's nose despite the head \nthrust. \nIn vestibular neuritis, the vestibular-ocular reflex is impaired, \nand the eyes move with patient's head making them unable to \nmaintain visual fixation on the examiner's nose. The patient's eyes \nthen saccade back to return the nose to focus. This is referred to as \na positive head thtust test. Thus, patients with vestibular neuritis \nusually have an abnormal head impulse test, which is paradoxi-\ncally reassuring. See https://ars.els-cdn.com/ content/image/ 1-s2.0-\nS0733861915000365-mmc3 .mp4 \nOn the other hand, the vestibular ocular reflex is often intact \nin patients with central vertigo from a posterior fossa suoke. Such \npatients are usually able to maintain focus on the examiner's finger \nor nose when their head is turned and such patients usually have a \nnormal (or negative) head impulse test. \nThe head impulse test should not be utilized to evaluate patients \nwith brief episodes of venigo, which are not suggestive of the acute \nvestibular syndrome because the results may be confusing. \nIn summary, a negative {normal) head thrust in a patient with \nthe acute vestibular syndrome suggests a central lesion rather than \nvestibular neuritis. \nDirection changing nystagmus refers to nystagmus in which \nthe fast component is in one direction on rightward gaze, and in a \ndifferent direction on leftward gaze. This suggests central disease. \n{In peripheral disease, the fast component beats in the same direc-\ntion regardless of the direction of gaze.) \nSkedeviation is a condition in which the eyes are not aligned \nin the vertical plane. This is more easily identified during a cover-\nuncover test. See http://emcrit.org/misdposterior-stroke-video/. \nSkedeviation suggests central pathology. \nTaken together, a careful neurologic exam that included the \nHINTS examination was 96.8% sensitive and 98.5% specific for \nstroke or other central causes of the acute vestibular syndrome \n{LR+, 64; LR-, 0.03). Sec Table 14-5. \nIn summary, patients with the acute vestibular syndrome \nshould undergo a thorough neurologic revieof symptoms, cranial \nnerve, cerebellar, and HINTS exam. Any of the following suggests \nCNS disease and warrants neuroimaging (preferably with MRI): \n(1) abnormal neurologic symptom, (2) abnormal neurologic sign, \nor (3) normal head impulse test, (4) bidirectional nystagmus, or \n(5) vertical skedeviation. The approach to patients with the acute \nvestibular syndrome is illustrated in Figure 14-5. \nTable 14-5.

The vertigo is often exacerbated by head motion (similar \nto BPPV) but present even at rest (unlike BPPV). Subsequently, \npatients may complain of intermittent vertigo that occurs for \nweeks to months and is precipitated by head movement. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Acute vestibular neuritis is caused by inflammation of the \nvestibular-cochlear nerve. This innervates the anterior and \nhorizontal semicircular canals resulting in vertigo. \nB. The inferior division supplies the cochlea and is usually \nasymptomatic, leaving hearing typically unimpaired. \nC. The etiology is uncertain but may be due to reactivation of \nherpes simplex virus 1. \nD. Severe vertigo typically lasts 2-3 days and may last up to \n1 week. Milder symptoms may persist for 6 weeks or longer. \nE. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a variant of vestibular neuritis. \n1. Varicella zoster reactivation involving cranial nerves \nVII and VIII produces vestibular neuritis with hearing \nloss and facial weakness. \n2. Vesicles are seen in the external auditory canal. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosis is usually made through clinical examination and \nconsideration of other more serious alternative diagnoses. \n(Cerebellar stroke is commonly misdiagnosed [34%] as \nvestibular neuritis.} \nB. Like most causes of vertigo, vertigo in vestibular neuritis is \nworsened by head movements. But, unlike BPPV. it is not \nsolely triggered by head movement. It is spontaneous and \noften present even when patients are still. \nC. Nausea and vomiting are common. \nD. Patients often have spontaneous nystagmus (occurring with-\nout head motion) that is unilateral, horizontal, or horizontal \nand torsional and suppressed by visual fixation. Bidirectional \nnystagmus suggests a different (central) disorder. \nE. Gait instability may be present, but patients maintain the \nability to ambulate. However, they should be able to sit or \nstand unaided with their feet spread apart and eyes open \nwithout falling. Severe unsteadiness suggests an alternative \ncentral process. \nF. Patients may fall during Romberg testing. \nG. The neurologic exam should include a cranial nerve exam with \nparticular emphasis on extraocular movements, a cerebellar \nexam (including gait}, and Romberg sign. \n1. Significant CNS signs or symptoms suggest central vertigo \nand the need for neuroimaging. \n2. Key CNS symptoms and signs include: \na. Headache \nb. Neck pain \nc. Dysarthria \nd. Diplopia \ne. Weakness \n Inability to ambulate \nDIZZINESS I 257 \ng. Dysmctria \nh. Cranial nerve findings \ni. Horner syndrome \nj. Central type nystagmus \nk. Persistence of severe vertigo beyond a fedays \n3.

The HINTS exam is very accurate for identifying stroke or \nother central causes of the acute vestibular syndrome. \n1. Sensitivity, 96.8%; specificity, 98.5% \n2. LR+, 64; LR-, 0.03 \nI. The expected findings in patients with vestibular neuritis \ninclude an abnormal head impulse test, no bidirectional \nnystagmus, and negative venical skedeviation. \nJ. Table 14-5 compares the findings in patients with vestibular \nneuritis and patients with central vertigo. \nTreatment \nA. Meclizine (antihistamine}, dimenhydrinate, and scopolamine \n(anticholinergic} arc drugs of choice in most patients. \nB. Antiemetics arc useful for severe nawea, vomiting. \nC. Benzodiazepines have also been used. \nD. Medications are sedating. Driving should be avoided. \nE. Corticosteroids have been demonstrated to improve vestibular \nrecovery, although symptomatic and functional improve-\nments have not been consistently demonstrated. Their use is \ncontroversial. \nF. Antiviral medications are not useful. \nG. Vestibular rehabilitation using exercises that stimulate the \nlabyrinth can promote CNS adaptation and hasten recovery. \nA5 noted above, Mr. D'5 routine neurologlc examination \nwa5 unremarkable.

First, his head impulse test is normal & \nnoted above, vestibular neuritis typically causes an abnormal head \nimpulse test, so this normal result is worrisome. Indeed, a normal \nhead impulse test in a patient with the acute vestibular syndrome \n\n258 I CHAPTER 14 \nhas an LR+ of 17 for CNS disease. Additionally, Mr. D has bidim;-\ntional nystagmus, which is a CNS finding. Focusing on potential \nCNS causes, you recognize that Mr. D is the right age for MS \n(but is at lower risk given his sex and unusual presenration). A \ncerebrovascular accident is possible, although he is young and his \nhypenension has been well controlled. A primary intracranial neo-\nplasm is also possible; given these alternative hypotheses, neuroim-\naging is required and an MRI is ordered. \nThe MRI reveals multiple perlventrlcular white matter \nplaques In addition to 1 In the bralnstem, highly suggestive \nof MS. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis \nTextbook Presentation \nMS typically affects young women of Western European descent \nwho experience attacks of CNS dysfunction that develop over \ndaY5 to weeks and then remit partially or completely. Neattacks \nat different times and in different CNS locations (space) are the \nhallmark of MS. \nDisease Highlights \nA. A multifocal demyelinating disease characterized by CNS \nlesions that develop in different parts of the brain at different \ntimes. Lesions may or may not resolve. \nB. Etiology \nI. MS develops secondary to an inflammatory autoimmune \ndisease triggered by environmental agents in genetically \nsusceptible patients resulting in multifocal CNS \ndemyelination. \n2. Demyelinatlon may result in neurologic deficits, which can \nbe transient if remyelination or axonal adapration occurs. \n3. Amnal injury may result in irreversible injury. \nC. Epidemiology \nI. The most common cause of nontraumatic neurologic \ndisability in young adults \n2. Women are affected 2-3 times more than men. \n3. Patients are usually between the ages of 18 and 45 years \nat onset. \n4. Several studies suggest that late infection (ie, in \nadolescence) with Epstein-Barr virus may increase the \nrisk of MS. \nD. Symptoms and signs \nI. Relapse-remitting MS \na. Most common clinical course of MS (85%) in which \na first discrete episode, (a clinically isolated syndrome, \nsee below), is followed by recovery and then subsequent \nattacks are followed by full or partial recovery \nb. Secondary progressive MS, in which progressive \ndeterioration occurs with or without acute attacks, \neventually develops in most of these patients. \n2. A smaller percentage of patients present with primary \nprogressive MS in which steady progression (with or \nwithout acute attacks) is present at the outset of the disease. \n3. Clinically isolated syndromes: A symptomatic event due \nto a focal area ofCNS demyelination in a patient not \npreviously diagnosed with MS. 20--80% of patients with \na clinically isolated syndrome develop MS. MRI and \ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test results greatly aid in the \ndiagnosis and risk stratification of MS. Common clinically \nisolated syndromes include: \na. Optic neuritis \n(1) Presenting complaint in 15-20% of patients \n(2) Patients complain of monocular visual loss, \nmonocular visual field loss (scotoma), and difficulty \ndiscerning color that evolves over hours to days. \n(3) Pain with extraocular movement is common (92%). \n(4) Afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil) is \nalmost alwaY5 seen. \n(5) Fundoscopic exam is normal in two-thirds of \npatients. Swelling of the optic nerve may be seen, \nbut hemorrhages are rare. \n(6) With long-term follow-up, MS develops in 15-75% \nof patients with optic neuritis (50-80% if the MRI \nscan is abnormal versus 6-22% if the MRI scan \nlacks disseminated features of MS). \nb. Partial spinal cord syndromes \n(1) Band-like sensation \n(2) Varying degrees of pain, light touch, and \nproprioceptive loss \n(3) Bilateral sensory loss caudal to a level \n(4) Weakness associated with spasticity, extensor plantar \nresponses, hyperreflexia, and clonus \n(5) Electrical sensation from spine into the limbs that \noccurs with neck flexion (Lhermitte sign) \nc. lntranuclear ophthalmoplegia \n(1) The medial longitudinal fasciculus coordinates \nconjugate eye movement such that on lateral gaze \n1 eye adducts while the other abducts. \n(2) An intranuclear ophthalmoplegia develops when a \nlesion interrupts the medial longimdinal fasciculus \npathway. \n(3) On lateral gaze, abduction occurs but adduction in \nthe opposite eye is impaired producing diplopia. \nNystagmus develops in the abducting eye. \n(4) Adduction during convergence is maintained, \ndistinguishing an intranuclear ophthalmoplegia \nfrom a third nerve palsy. \n(5) lntranuclear ophthalmoplegia is seen in 33-50% of \npatients with MS. \n(6) lnuanuclear ophthalmoplegia is not specific for MS; \nit may develop secondary to vascular disease. \nd. Vertigo is the presenting symptom in 5% of patients \nwith MS and is reported in 30-50% of patients with \nMS; it is commonly associated with other cranial nerve \nd)75function. \ne. Up to 33% of patients presenting with a \"first\" \ndemyelinating event have had prior symptoms on \ncareful questioning. The McDonald criteria suggest \nconfirming prior symptomatic attacks with objective \nevidence (eg, abnormal MRI, visual evoked response). \n4. Pain is a common and important symptom in MS patients \nwith an overall prevalence of 63%. This includes headache \nin 43%, neuropathic extremity pain 27%, back pain 20%, \npainful spasms 15%, and Lhermitte sign 16%. \n\n5. Other common symptoms include a variety of sensory \nsymptoms, gait disturbance, tremor (46%), urinary \nincontinence, fatigue (in 90%), depression, and cognitive \ndysfunction. \n6. Uhthoff phenomenon: worsening of MS symptoms \nin warm environments (eg, in the shower and during \nexercise); believed to be due to decreased nerve conduction \nin heat. \n7. Atypical findings that suggest alternative diagnoses \ninclude age of presentation < 10 years or > 50 years, rapid \ndevelopment of neurologic symptoms (within minutes), \nearly dementia, ddirium, cortical defects (eg, aphasia), \nseizures, a single brain lesion, or a spinal lesion without \nbrain lesion. \nE. Infections (viral or bacterial) and live attenuated virus \nvaccinations may trigger attacks. (Inactivated vaccines \nare safe.) \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. There is no single test that diagnoses MS. Rather, it is the \nintegration of clinical, radiologic and supporting laboratory \ninformation that confirms the diagnosis. \nB. Prior diagnostic criteria required the demonstration of~ 2 \nclinical attacks of~ 24 hours in duration (in the absence of \nfever or infection), separated in time and in space (different \nCNS locations). The 2017 McDonald criteria arc complex \nbut incorporate the MRI and CSF results (oligoclonal bands) \nto allofor the diagnosis of MS in patients with a clinically \nisolated syndrome. \nC. Brain MRI is the test of choice. \n1. Useful to predict, diagnose, and determine disease activity \nin MS. \n2. Demonstrates periventricular white matter lesions Oesions \nmay also be seen in other white matter locations). \n3. The precise MRI criteria required for diagnosis are \ncontroversial (number of periventricular white matter \nlesions, etc). \na. Sensitivity, ~85-92%; specificity, 26-40% \nb. LR+, 1.2-1.4; LR-, 0.27--0.38 \n4. Gadolinium enhancement suggests neor newly active \nplaques. \n5. Nonspeciflc white matter lesions are common, and \ndistinction from MS lesions can be complex. \nD. Spinal MRI has similar sensitivity (75-83%) to brain MRI \nbut is more specific (97%). Spinal MRI can be particularly \nuseful in patients with spinal cord symptoms and in patients \nwith other clinically isolated syndromes by demonstrating \nother lesions and thereby fulfilling the criteria of dissemina-\ntion in space. \nE. CSF can be useful in patients in whom the diagnosis is \nuncertain. \n1. Cell counts are usually normal. \n2. Bands of oligoclonal IgG suggesting inflammation may be \ndetected in the CSF. \na. Considered positive if there is > 1 band that is unique \nto the CSF (ie, not also found in the serum) \nb. In patients with MS, 89.8% sensitive, 86% specific; \nLR+, 6.4; LR-, 0.12 \nDIZZINESS I 259 \nc. Positive in 67.5% of patients with their first clinically \nisolated syndrome. \n3. CSF features that suggest alternative diagnoses include \nCSF protein> 100 mg/dL, > 50 cells/mcL, or the presence \natypical cdls, neutrophils, or eosinophils. \nF. Evoked potentials \n1. Evoked potentials are dectrical potentials recorded from \nthe nervous system in response to a stimulus (sensory, \nvisual, or auditory) that can determine the integrity of that \npathway. \n2. Visual evoked potentials are 65-85% sensitive but not \nspecific for MS. \n3. Somatosensory evoked potentials \na. 69-77% sensitive \nb. Abnormal in 50% of patients with MS without sensory \nsigns or symptoms \nTreatment \nA. Acute exacerbations can be treated with high-dose IV corticos-\nteroids, and if refractory, by plasma exchange \nB. A variety of immunomodulatory agents have been used in MS \nas disease-modifying treatments, including interferon beta and \na wide variety of other agents. \nC. Neuropathic pain can be treated with gabapentin, carbam-\nazepine, and valproic acid. \nD. Bone mineral density should be monitored in patients with \nlolevels of activity and in those requiring corticosteroids. \nE. Complications of MS such as tremor, mood disorders, \ncognitive impairment, spasticity, bladder and bowel \ndysfunction benefit from specific therapies. \nF. Routine follow-up brain MRI is indicated in symptomatic \npatients, treated patients, and asymptomatic patients to assess \ndisease activity and progression. \nAlternative Diagnosis: lntracranial Neoplasm \nSee Chapter 20, Headache. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nThe MRI is highly suggestive of MS. \nDespite encouragement f rom you to continue t he evalua-\ntion, Mr. D refuses and is lost to follow-up. One year later he \npresents wit h urinary Incontinence, and a spinal MRI reveals \nneenhancing white matter plaq,ues. He thus has evidence \nof lesions distributed In time and space and fulfllle; criteria \nfor MS. He is referred to neurology for treatment. \nMr. D presented with vertigo that was worse with motion, a \nsymptom complex easily mistaken as BPPV. However, his pro-\nlonged continuous spontaneous vertigo clearly suggested the acute \nvestibular syndrome. A careful examination led to 2 diagnostic \nfindings (bidirectional nystagmus and a normal head impulse test), \nwhich clearly identified the brainstem as the site of the pathol-\nogy. Appropriate neuroimaging pointed to a diagnosis that at first \nglance seemed improbable, MS. \n\n260 I CHAPTER 14 \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs.Sis a 70-year-old woman with a history of depres-\nsion and anxiety who complains of dizziness. Over the last \n1-2 months she notes Increasing Intermittent dizziness. \nWhen asked to describe her dizziness In more detail, she \nhas trouble and describes neither vertigo, near syncope. \nnor dyseGj,uilibrium. She does mention that It seems to \nbe worse while standing. Mrs. S has also been under more \nstress than usual. Her daughter died several years ago and \nher husband has been chronically Ill and Is scheduled for \nsurgery next month. \nAt thl5 point, what le the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altematlve9, and 19 \nthere a must not ml55 diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnoeie, what teete ehould 17e \nordsred? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMrs. S has described ill-dc:flned light-headedness (Figure 14-1). \nIdentifying the cause in such patients is complex because it can \narise from neurologic, cardiac, or inner ear diseases; be due to \northostatic hypotension; or be a symptom of depression and anx-\niety (Figure 14-7). Her psychiatric history and social stressors are \na clue suggesting she may be suffering from nonspeciflc dizziness \ndue to depression, anxiety, or her social stressors. This is the leading \nhypothesis. Additionally, Mrs. S mentioned that her symptoms are \nworse while standing, raising the possibility of orthostatic hypoten-\nsion. Finally, nonspeciflc dizziness is frequently caused by medica-\ntions. Table 14-6 lists the differential diagnosis. \nMrs. S readily admits to a loss of Interest In her activities \nand anhedonla.

She has no incriminating medications. \nLeading Hypothesis: Nonspecific Dizziness \nTextbook Presentation \nIll-dc:flned dizziness is often secondary to a psychiatric disorder \nsuch as panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, \nsomatization disorder, alcohol dependence, or personality dis-\norder. The dizziness is often of long duration (years) and poorly \ndc:flned. Patients may complain of fogginess, feeling woozy, \nmental fuzziness, loss of energy, or a wobbly or a .floating sensa-\ntion. Patients may complain of other associated symptoms partic-\nularly if they have panic attacks, including chest pain, shortness of \nbreath, impending sense of doom, palpitations, perioral paresthe-\nsias, tingling in the hands and feet, and light-headedness. \nDisease Highlights \nA. 20-38% of patients attending a clinic specializing in dizziness \ndemonstrated panic disorder. \nB. Psychiatric symptoms may devdop without any identifiable \norganic cause or develop after episodes of true vertigo or syncope. \nC. Symptoms can be secondary to hyperventilation, which leads \nto hypocapnia resulting in decreased cerebral blood flow. \nD. Patients may complain of light-headedness or near syncope. \nE. Milder variants of somatization disorder are more common \nthan the full-blown entity. Such variants may be precipitated \nby stress or minor physiologic disturbances. Paradoxically, \nsuch patients are often disturbed by negative test results rather \nthan reassured. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Continuous sensation of vertigo lasting longer than 1-2 weeks \nwithout daily variation is likely psychogenic. This is to be \ndistinguished from intermittent vertigo, recurring for weeks, \nprecipitated by motion. \nB. One study reported 62% of patients with hyperventilation \nhad other significant psychiatric disorders. \nC. Symptom reproduction by induced hyperventilation is \nnonspeciflc. \nD. Care must be taken before ascribing dizziness to a psychiatric \netiology. \n1. Multiple studies have demonstrated a high prevalence \nof anxiety (22-67%) among patients with well-dc:flned \norganic etiologies of their dizziness. \n2. Anxiety scores are as high in patients with acute \nlabyrinthine fu.ilure and vestibular dysfunction as among \npatients with no vestibular diagnosis. \n~ \nPsychiatric symptoms may be sequelae of the \nV\" dizziness rather than the cause. \nE. Certain physical findings suggest a psychogenic etiology. \n1. Moment-to-moment fluctuations in impairment \n\n2. Excessi~ slowness or hesitation \n3. Exaggerated sway on Romberg, improved by distraction \n4. Sudden budding of knee, typically without falling \n5. A cautious \"walking on ice\" pattern \nTreatment \nA. Appropriate evaluation to exclude organic etiologies. \nB. Discuss patient's concerns and fears about the diagnosis. \nC. Educate the patient not to overly restrict physical activities \nsince this impairs CNS compensation and may worsen the \nphysical symptoms. \nD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) and benzodi-\nazepines are used in patienrs with panic attacks and anxiety \ndisorders. SSRls are preferred due to potential problems with \nbenzodiazepines (eg, dependence, tolerance, exacerbation of \nsymptoms on discontinuation, sedation, interference with \ncognition in the elderly, and exacerbation of depression). \nE. Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been effective. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMrs. S confirms your suspicion that she Is depressed \nand you feel that this is the likely cause of her nonspecific \ndizziness.

Orthostatic hypotension is covered in detail in \nChapter 31, Syncope. This section will briefly cover other aspects \nof orthostatic dizziness. \nTatbook Present.ad.on \nPatients with orthostatic dizziness classically complain of dizziness \nupon standing. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Orthostatic dizziness may or may not be secondary to \northostatic hypotension. \nB. Orthostatic hypotension may be transient and not detected on \nphysical exam (see Chapter 31, Syncope) \nC. Other causes of orthostatic dizziness include neuropathy, \nimpaired vision, and BPPV. (Patients with orthostatic dizziness \ndue to BPPV almost always also have symptoms when their \nhead position changes without standing [rolling o~r. looking \nup, etc.].) \nD. Criteria include nonvestibular dizziness, which is precipitated \nby standing and lasts from seconds to < 5 minutes. \nE. Lifetime prevalence of orthostatic dizziness is 8.5% and \naccounts for 55% of nonvestibular dizziness. \nDIZZINESS I 261 \nF. Consequences of orthostatic dizziness include \n1. Syncope, 18.5% \n2.

You elect \nto initiate treatment for her depression with an SSRI, refer her to \npsychiatry for counsding and see her back in 1 month. You hope \nher symptoms will have improved at that time. \n\nMrs. 5 returns 1 month later even more dist ressed t han \nat the time of her last visit . She reports her dizziness is \nworse, and that she is nohaving trouble walking and driv-\ning. When asked to elaborate. she reports that she feels \nunsteady on her feet and Is sea red that she wtll fall. \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMrs. S's complaints are clearly worrisome. Her symptoms have \nevolved and she is no longer describing ill-defined light-headedness \nbut rather dysequilibrium. As discussed in the introduction, dyse-\nquilibrium is the sensation of imbalance and may be due to diseases \nof the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. A careful neurologic \nrevieof symptoms and neurologic exam is critical to focus the \ndiagnostic search (Figure 14-6). \nMrs. S denies headache. numbness. or weakness. How-\never. she reports t hat she no longer trusts herself driving \nbecause of her double vision. Surprised by t his comment \nyou ask her to clescrlbe her double vision and she reports \nthat she sees 2 lines on the road In areas where there \nis only 1 line. On neurologic exam. her cranial nerves are \nintact (Including her extraacular movement s). and her gait \nappears slightly unsteady. \n\n262 I CHAPTER 14 \nThe lengthy differential diagnosis for dysequilibrium is intim-\nidating, but Mrs. S's complaint of diplopia is a highly specific \npivotal clinical clue that focuses the differential diagnosis on \ndiseases affecting the brainstem. Neither diseases of the cerebral \ncortex, dorsal column, peripheral nerves, multiple sensory deficits \nnor her depression would cause diplopia. You revise your leading \nhypothesis to diseases affecting that region of the brain. In her age \ngroup, the 2 most common conditions affecting the brainstem are \ncerebrovascular disease or posterior fossa tumor. \nLeading Hypothesis: Cerebrovascular Disease \nTextbook Presentation \nCerebrovascular disease encompasses a multitude of diseases in \nwhich disordered blood supply results in CNS dysfunction. The \nneurologic symptoms may be transient (typically < 1 hour) if \nblood supply is reestablished quickly or permanent if infarction \n(stroke) occurs. TIAs refer to brief attacks without infarction \non imaging. The location of ischemia within the brain and the \nmechanism of the event determine the type of symptoms, their \nrapidity of onset, and severity. This discussion will focus on those \ncerebrovascular diseases associated with vertigo or dysequilibrium; \nvertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) and lacunar infarction of the \npons and cerebellum. Other causes including cerebellar hemor-\nrhage and vertebral artery dissection (VAD) are discussed later in \nthe chapter. \n1. VBI \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation ofVBI is an elderly patient with diabetes, \nhypertension, or both who complains of intermittent spells of ver-\ntigo associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as diplopia, \ndysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, or ataxia. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Risk factors include hypertension (58-70%), tobacco use \n(42%), diabetes mellitus (25%), and hyperlipidemia (19%). \nCommon comorbidities include coronary artery disease (42%) \nand peripheral vascular disease (11 %). \nBasilar ischemia should be considered in \npatients with vertigo who have significant \ncerebrovascular disease risk factors {eg, \ndiabetes mellitus). \nB. Atherosclerosis is often present in the vertebral and the basilar \narteries. Symptoms may be caused by loflow, embolism \n{artery to artery), or thrombosis. VAD is another important \ncause in young patients (see below). Cardiac sources of \nembolism may also cause posterior strokes or TIAs. \nC. The 90-day recurrent stroke rate in symptomatic patients with \ndemonstrable stenosis is 13.9% vs. 2.8% in those without \nstenosis. Stenosis is a more significant risk factor for recurrence \nthan hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, or prior stroke. \nThe stroke rate in symptomatic patients with \nvertebrobasilar stenosis is exceptionally high \nmaking this a must not miss diagnosis. \nD. Dizziness in patients with VBI may be described as tilting \nrather than spinning. \nE. Symptoms may last for minutes or hours with VBI (but may \npersist in patients with stroke or cerebellar hemorrhage). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. 50% of patients have a normal neurologic exam between the \nepisodes. Attacks can last seconds to hours but usually last \nminutes (if they were not associated with infarction). \nB. Manifestations ofVBI and their frequency \n1. Visual changes (diplopia, hallucinations, or field \ndefects), 69% \n2. Vertigo, 58% (isolated without other CNS symptoms \nin 7.5-29%) \n3. Unsteadiness-incoordination, 21 % \n4. Confusion, 17% \nS. Headache, 14% \n6. Loss of consciousness, 10% \nC. Patients with transient symptoms occasionally have strokes \non imaging. MRI is more sensitive for ischemic strokes than \nCT scanning (Table 14-7). However, both may be negative in \npatients with TIA without stroke. \n~ \nCT is insensitive for the diagnosis of acute \ny \nstroke. \nD. MRA, CT angiography (CTA), and angiography have \nbeen used. \n1. MRI with MRA is procedure of choice; 83-89% sensitive, \n87-98% specific \n2. CTA can be used in patients with contraindications to \nMRI/MRA; 58-68% sensitive, 92-93% specific \n3. Angiography is invasive but the gold standard. \nE. Duplex ultrasonography is neither sensitive nor specific. \nF. Echocardiography is useful in patients with \n1. Suspected embolic disease, particularly those without \nevidence of basilar or vertebral artery disease on \nneuroimaging \n2. Isolated cerebellar infarcts or infarcts in multiple vascular \nterritories \nG. Long-term electrocardiographic monitoring identifies \nunsuspected atrial fibrillation in 15% of patients with stroke \nor TIA of unclear cause and is also recommended. \nTreatment \nA. Recurrent TIAs and strokes are very common in patients with \nVBI (28% recurrent TIA or stroke within 90 days). One-half \nof these occur in the first 48 hours after the initial symptom. \nThe incidence of recurrent stroke or TIA is \nexceptionally high in the first 48 hours after an \nattack. Patients presenting with a recent TIA \nshould be admitted for evaluation and therapy. \nTable 14-7.

Emergent neuroimaging, including MRA or CTA, and \nneurology consultation is advised. \nC. Ex.uacranial stenosis with TIA or stroke \n1. BP control, high-intensity statin therapy, and \nantithrombotic therapy is recommended. \n2. Revascularization {with stenting or surgery) may be \nconsidered in patients with recurrent events despite \noptimal medical therapy. \nD. lntracranial stenosis with TIA or stroke \n1. Aspirin, 325 mg/day, is recommended. \n2. Clopidogrel, 75 mg/day, is a reasonable alternative to \naspirin in patients with events within the last 30 days and \nstenosis of70-99%. The current recommendation suggests \nusing it for 90 days. \n3. Revascularization is not recommended for patients with \nstenosis of 50-69% and remains under investigation for \npatients with stenosis ~ 70%. \nE. Patients with nestrokes should be treated as outlined under \nInfarction of the Pons or Cerebellum. \n2. Infarction of the Pons or Cerebellum \nTextbook Presentation \nTypically, the presenting symptoms are rapid onset ofhemiparesis, \nsensory symptoms, or ataxia. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Etiology: Brainstem strokes may occur due to either lacunar \ninfarction or nonlacunar mechanisms. \n1. Lacunar infarction \na. Account for 15-26% ofischemic strokes \nb. Long-standing hypertension causes lipohyalinosis of the \nsmall penetrating vessels, which may thrombose and \ncause lacunar infarction. \nc. Commonly involves the pons; other common locations \ninclude the basal ganglia, internal capsule, and \nthalamus. \nd. Incidence in the black population is approximately \ntwice that in the white population. \ne. Cortical signs (aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, and \nhemianopsia) are absent. \n2. Isolated cerebellar infarction is often due to nonlacunar \nmechanisms, including cardioembolism, large vessel \natherosclerosis, and occasionally VAD. \na. Large vessel atherosclerosis may cause stroke if there \nis either thrombosis or artery to artery downstream \nembolization. \nb. Identification of artery to artery embolization is \nimportant due to the much higher stroke recurrence rate \nin these patients compared with patients without such \nlesions (16% vs 1 %). \n3. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, dyslipidemia, \natrial fibrillation, and valvular heart disease are important \nrisk factors. \n4. 25% of these strokes occur in patients < 50 years of age in \nwhom the leading cause is VAD. Such patients oft:en lack \ntraditional risk factors leading clinicians to underestimate \nthe risk of stroke. (See VAD below.) \nB. Complications: Deterioration in the first 3 days occurs in \n10-20% of patients with cerebellar strokes. \nDIZZINESS I 263 \n1. Occurs due to swelling, hemorrhage, and brainstem \ncompression. \n2. Such patients may require emergent neurosurgical \nintervention. \n3. Missed diagnoses are associated with a marked increase risk \nof death. \n4. This is a must not miss diagnosis that requires a detailed \nneurologic evaluation, frequently accompanied by \nneuroimaging. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. > 34% of patient with cerebellar stroke are misdiagnosed. The \nmost common misdiagnosis was vestibular neuritis. \nB. Pontine/cerebellar strokes may be associated with vertigo, \nipsilateral weakness, ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. The \ndizziness may be described as vertigo, tilting, or swaying. \nC. Certain symptoms are important dues that suggest cerebellar \nstroke when present but are insensitive and often absent. \n1. Headache \na. Although insensitive (23-40% overall) headaches \nare an important clue to the diagnosis of cerebellar \ninfarction \nb. A case series has shown that headaches were present in \n13 of 15 patients in whom the diagnosis was missed. \n2. Other focal findings were also unusual (see Table 14-8) \n3. Furthermore, only 27% of patients with vertigo due to \nsmall brainstem infarctions had focal symptoms. \n4. Vertigo: \na. It is estimated that 10-55% of patients with acute \npersistent vertigo have suffered a stroke. \nb. Vertigo was the presenting symptom in 23% of patients \nwith cerebellar infarction. \nc. Similar to BPPV and vestibular neuritis, vertigo may be \nexacerbated by head motion. \nVertigo exacerbated by motion is not pathog-\nnomonic of BPPV and should not exclude the \nconsideration of other etiologies. \ncl. The HINTS exam is highly accurate for the diagnosis \nof stroke and other CNS causes of central vertigo \nin patients with the acute vestibular syndrome \n(Table 14-5). \n(1) Sensitivity, 96.8%; specificity, 98.5% \n(2) LR+, 63.9; LR-, 0.03 \nTable 14-8.

The HINTS plus exam adds nehearing loss to the \nstandard HINTS criterion because nehearing loss \nsuggests CNS disease; this increases sensitivity slightly. \n(1) Sensitivity, 99.2%; specificity, 97.0% \n(2) LR+, 32.7; LR-, 0.01 \n5. In summary, patients with vertigo should have a careful \nneurologic revieof systems, neurologic exam (focused \nespecially on the brainstem and cerebdlum), and HINTS \nplus exam to identify cercbdlar or brainstcm infarction. \nD. Ncuroimaging \n1. Because CT imaging has losensitivity (16% for ischemic \nstroke) its role is to rule out hcmorrhage in patients with \nstroke who arc candidates for thrombolysis. \n2. DW-MRI \na. Superior to er but still imperfect at detecting acute \npontine infarcts (80-87% sensitivity in first 24 hours); \nLR-, 0.21. \nb. Early MRI was particularly insensitive at detecting small \nacute infarcts (47%}. \n3. MRI should be performed in patients with venigo \naccompanied by any of the following: \na. Abnormal CNS signs or symptoms (eg, diplopia, central \ntype nystagmus, dysanhria, inability to ambulate, \ndysmetria, or visual field defects} \nb. Any positive result on the \"HINTS plus\" exam \nc. Neck pain (suggesting possible venebral artery dissection) \nd. Persistence of severe vertigo beyond a fedays \n(Figures 14-2 and 14-5) \nA negative MRI in patients with an acute \nvestibular syndrome does not conclusivdy rule \nout a stroke and repeat MRI should be strongly \nconsidered in those with a positive HINTS \nexamination. \n4. In patients with confirmed stroke, MRA or erA should \nalso be performed to evaluate patients for vertebral or \nbasilar artery stenosis, VAD, or cmboli. Studies suggest that \nrisk factors do not reliably separate patients with lacunar \ninfarctions due to disease of the small penetrating arteries \nfrom patients with large vessel disease at higher risk fur \nrecurrences. \nE. Echocardiography is useful in patients with suspected embolic \ndisease, particularly those without evidence of basilar or verte-\nbral artery disease on neuroimaging and in those with isolated \ncerebellar infarcts or infarcts in multiple vascular territories. \nF. Long-term dectrocardiographic monitoring identifies unsus-\npccted atrial fibrillation in 15% of patients with stroke or TIA \nof unclear cause and is also recommended. \nTreatment \nA. Close observation is critical, since patients with brainstem \ninfarcts are at increased risk for edema, hemorrhage, or obstruc-\ntive hydrocephalus, which may cause herniation and death. \nB. The AHAJASA 2018 guiddines for the management of acute \nischcmic stroke included the following: \n1. Evaluation \na. Initial evaluation should include a neurologic exam, \nassessment of stroke severity (using the NIHSS stroke \nscale) and emergent neuroimaging. \nb. Emergent noncontrast er within 20 minutes of \nhospital arrival to rule out acute intracranial hemorrhage \nis required prior to administration of antithrombotic \ntherapy. \n(1) A negative CT scan does not rule out an acute \nstroke in the appropriate clinical situation nor the \nneed for appropriate treatment. \n(2) DW-MRI is more sensitive than CT scanning and \nselective use is appropriate. \nc. Blood glucose should be checked prior to the initiation \nof thrombolytics in all patients to exclude hypoglycemia \nor massive hyperglycemia masquerading as an acute \nischemic stroke. \nd. Other routine laboratory studies should include ECG, \nbasic metabolic profile, troponin, and HbA,c but should \nnot delay reperfusion therapy. International normalized \nratio (INR}, activated partial thromboplastin time \n(aPTT), and platelet counts are indicated in select \npatients. \n2. Treatment \na. Reperfusion \n(1) Thrombolytic therapy for disabling strokes \n(a) Recommended in patients with disabling \nstrokes without contraindications who may \nbe treated within 3 hours of symptom onset \nand fur select patients with symptoms of \n3-4.5 hours in duration or patients with mild \nnondisabling strokes. (Note: In patients who \nawoke with stroke symptoms, the time they were \nlast observed to be at baseline should be used \n[ie, prior to sleep].} \n(b) lntracranial hemorrhage is a contraindication \nand must be excluded (with noncontrast CT) \nprior to administration. \n(c) There are a large number of other \ncontraindications that must be excluded prior \nto administration. (See 2018 AHN ASA acute \nstroke guidelines.} \n(d) Goal of door to needle time < 60 minutes. \n(2) Mechanical thrombectomy and stent are options fur \nselect patients with major arterial occlusions, even \nthose with symptoms up to 24 hours in duration. \nPatients who are candidates for thrombolytics \nshould still be treated while awaiting mechanical \ntherapy. \nb. Aspirin (160-300 mg) is recommended within \n24--48 hours and should be delayed 24 hours for \npatients receiving thrombolytics. \nc. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) \nbeginning within 24 hours and continued for 90 days \ncan be beneficial for patients presenting with minor \nstroke. \nd. BP management \n(1) In patients receiving flbrinolytic therapy: BP should \nbe carefully lowered< 185/110 mm Hg prior to \nstarting flbrinolytic therapy. Preferred drugs include \nIV labetalol, nicardipinc, or clevidipine. \n(2) In patients not receiving fibrinolytic therapy: in \npatients with severe hypertension~ 220/120 mm Hg \nbut without other acute indication for BP lowering, \ntreatment is of uncertain benefit in the first \n48-72 hours. It may be reasonable to lower the \n\nBP by 15% in the first 24 hours. Stahle patients \nwho remain hypertensive(> 140/90 mm Hg) \nseveral days after sttokc should be treated. \ne. Intensive lipid lowering with statin therapy is \nrecommended to reduce the risk of stroke in patients \nwith ischcmic stroke or TIA presumed to be of \natherosclerotic origin. \n Miscellaneous \n(1) Fever (tcmpcwwe > 38C) should be treated. \n(2) Oxygen is recommended to maintain Sa02 > 94%. \n(3) Treat hypcrglyccmia to achieve blood glucose \n140-180 mg/dL. Avoid and treat hypoglycemia. \ng. Recommendations for patients found to have large \nvessel atherosclerosis arc found above under VBI. \nh.

In \npatients with vertigo, the next pivotal step is to look for neurologic \nsigns or symptoms that suggest whether the pathologic process is \ncoming from the brainstem or cerebellum (Figure 14-2). His head-\nache makes this an obvious consideration. The subset of diseases \nthat cause vertigo and headache include migraine with vertigo \n(vestibular migraine), cerebellar hemorrhage, intracranial neoplasm, \nand VAD. Clearly, several of these arc potentially life-threatening. \nMr. W reports that he has never experienced vertigo before. \nHe has an occasional headache that resolves with Ibupro-\nfen and has never been associated with an aura. He has \nno known vascular disease and does not have a history of \nhypertension, diabetes. tobacco use, coagulopathy, atrial \nflbrlllatlon. or cocaine use. He has no known rnallgnancy. \nFina.Uy. although he feels that It Is unrelated. he mentions \nthat he saa chiropractor for cervical adjustment about \n1 hour before his symptoms started. He reports that he \nsees his chiropractor regularly and has never had any symp-\ntoms subsequently. \nOn exam he looks fairly uncomfortable. His vital signs \nare normal except for mild hypertension 140/90 mm Hg. \nHis cranial nerve exam and gait are normal. He has no \nnystagmus or dysmetrla. The remainder of his exam ls \nunremarkable. \nGiven Mr. W's young age and overall health, you wonder if he \nis presenting with a migraine and vertigo. However, all of the alter-\nnative hypotheses are potentially life-threatening and are must not \nmiss hypotheses. Table 14-9 lists the differential diagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: Vestibular Migraine \nTextbook Presentation \nClassically, migraine sufferers complain of intermittent attacks of \nsevere unilateral throbbing headache associated with photophobia, \nphonophobia, nausea and vomiting (see Chapter 20, Headache). \nHeadaches may be preceded by an aura that is usually visual (se<>-\ntoma or scintillating lights). Occasionally, patients with migraine \ndisorders have vertigo, an entity referred to as vestibular migraine. \nThis discussion will focus on vestibular migraines. (See Chapter 20 \nfor a more complete discussion of migraine.) \nDisease Highlights \nA. Dizziness or vertigo is common during a migraine attack, \naffecting as many as 24.5% of patients with migraine \naccompanied by aura and up to 47.5% of patients with \nsevere migraine pain(~ 7/10). \nB. Characteristics of the vertigo in vestibular migraine include \n1. Lasts seconds to a week \n2. The vertigo is constant in 30% of patients and positional \n(brought on by head movement) in 60% of patients. \n3. The temporal association of vertigo with headache is \nvariable. \nTable 1 ~.

The venigo may precede, be concurrent with, follow, \nor be temporally unrdated to headache. \nb. Venigo was regularly associated with headache in 45% \nof patients and occurred with and without headache \nin 48% of patients. In 6% of patients, vertigo and \nmigraine did not occur together. \nc. However, in 95% of patients, a history of migraines \npreceded the development of vertigo (by an average \nof8-20 years). \nA history of migraines almost always pre-\ncedes the devdopment of vestibular migraine. \nPatients with a neheadache accompanied by \nvertigo should be evaluated for other diagnoses \n(eg, cerebellar hemorrhage, VAD). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The International Headache Society criteria for definite \nvestibular migraine require all 4 of the following: \n1. :!: 5 episodes of moderate to severe vertigo, lasting \n5 minutes to 72 hours \n2. Current or prior history of migraine with or without aura \n3. > 50% of vertiginous attacks accompanied by \n:!: 1 migrainous symptoms: \na. Headache with :!: 2 of the following: One-sided \nlocation, pulsatile, mod.crate to severe, aggravation \nwith activity \nb. Photophobia or phonophobia \nc. Visual aura \n\n4. Not better accounted for by another vestibular \ndiagnosis (This is particularly complex as Meniere attacks \nand other vestibular conditions can trigger migraine \nattacks.) \nB. Attack characteristics \n1. Common symptoms include nausea (95%), photophobia \n(70%), headache (65%), phonophobia (10%), and \naura{l0%). \n2. Central, spontaneous, or positional nystagmus may be \npresent during the attack. \n3. All patients with vestibular migraine have a normal finger \nto nose, heel to shin, and rapid alternating movements. \n4. 65% of patients have disturbances of gait, but only 5% \nwere unable to stand and walk. \n5. 70% of patient have an abnormal Romberg sign. \n6. Pathologic cranial nerve or cerebellar findings signs are \nseen in < 10% of patients with vestibular migraine during \nan attack. \n7. Hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural pressure occur in up \nto 38% of patients with vestibular migraine but, unlike \nMeniere disease, are usually mild, do not progress, or cause \nsevere hearing loss between attacks. \nTreaunent \nClues that suggest an alterativc: diagnosis \nand the need for additional evaluation in \npatients with both venigo and headache \ninclude: (1) neheadache with venigo or \ntypical migraine with new-onset vertigo, \n(2) persistent profound hearing loss or \nvestibular abnormalities between episodes, \n(3) an inability to ambulate during an attack, \nor (4) brainstem signs. \nA. Fewell-controlled studies have examined the effectiveness of \ntherapy for patients with vestibular migraine. \nB. Abortive therapy with zolmitriptan may be effective. \nC. Prophylactic therapy with either propranolol, vc:nlafaxinc:, or \nflunarizine (a calcium channel blocker) appear to be effective \nin patients with recurrent attacks. \nD.

Coupled with the \nlifc:-thrc:atc:ning nature of the: alternatives, his evaluation needs \nto continue. In particular, cerebellar hemorrhage is imminently \nlifc:-thrc:atc:ning and must be excluded. \nDIZZINESS I 267 \nCerebellar hemorrhage is a must not miss pos-\nsibility that must be considered in all patients \nwith headache: and vertigo. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Cerebellar Hemorrhage \nTatbook Presentation \nThe textbook presentation of cerebellar hemorrhage is the abrupt \nonset of headache associated with vomiting, ataxia, and vertigo. \nBrainstc:m compression may produce: weakness, cranial nerve: \nabnormalities, coma, and death. Patients with cerebellar infarc-\ntions have similar symptoms. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Cerebellar hemorrhage accounts for 5-16% cases of intracere-\nbral hemorrhagc:s. \nB. Cerebellar hemorrhage is a neurologic emergency due to the \npotential for hematoma expansion, herniation, and death. \nRapid progression within minutes to hours is common. \n1. 28--38% of patients demonstrate an increase in the \nhematoma on repeat CT scan within 3 hours of onset. \n2. Hematoma expansion is associated with a 5-fold increase: \nin poor outcomes and death. \n3. Both hematoma expansion and edema contribute \nto an increase: in intracranial pressure and brainstem \nherniation. \nC. Etiologies \n1. Most common: \na. Hypertensive hemorrhage \nb. Subarachnoid hemorrhage \nc. Amyloid angiopathy \nd. Arteriovenous malformations \n2. Less common: \na. Blood dyscrasias \nb. Hemorrhagic infarction \nc. Septic emboli \nd. Anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy \ne. Neoplasms \n Herpes simplex virus encephalitis \ng. Vasculitis \nh. Cocaine and amphetamine: use: \nD. Demographics \n1. Mean age is 61-73 years \n2. 36% have diabetes mellitus \n3. 32-73% have hypertension \n4. 14% have a coagulopathy \n5. Frequency: Asians > Blacks > Hispanics > Whites \nE. Complications \n1. Hydrocephalus (48%) \n2. Chronic disability \n3. Herniation and death (42%) \n4. Other: Pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and ventricular \narrhythmias \nF. Poor prognostic factors include \n1. Marked hydrocephalus \n\n268 I CHAPTER 14 \nTable 14-10.

Deteriorating consciousness \n3. Stupor and coma (100% mortality without surgery) \n4. Fever (correlates with ventricular extension of bleeding) \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Clinical findings \n1. The most common clinical symptoms are headache, \nvomiting, and altered consciousness (Table 14-10). \n2. Brainstem findings were universal in I study. \n3. Vertigo is present in 59% of patients. \nB. Laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, \nplatelet count, INR, partial thromboplastin time, basic met-\nabolic pand, ECG, chest radiograph, glucose, and toxicology \nscreen in young- and middle-aged patients. \nC. Prompt cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI is critical to \nidentify hemonhage. \nD. Patients with cerebellar hemorrhage due to aneurysms or \narteriovenous malformation may require additional imaging \nand interventions. \n1. Consider if there is a lolikdihood that the hemorrhage \nwas secondary to hypertension and in patients with \nsubarachnoid hemorrhage. \n2. Risk factors for vascular abnormalities include patients \n< 65 years old, cocaine use, female sex, nonsmoker, absence \nof a history of hypertension or coagulopathy. \n3. Aneurysms can be identified with CTA, contrast-enhanced \nCT, contrast-enhanced MRI, or MRA. \n4. Abnormal results can be evaluated with cerebral \nangiography. \nTreatment \nA. Cerebellar hemorrhages can compress vital brainstem structures \nand surgical evacuation can be lifesaving. \nB. Emergent surgical removal of the hemorrhage is recommended \nfor patients with large hemorrhages (> 3 cm), those with \nneurologic deterioration, brainstem compression, or hydro-\ncephalus from ventricular obstruction. \nC. ICU monitoring is critical. \nD. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy should be held and \nanticoagulation should be reversed immediatdy. \nE. Platelets should be administered to patient with severe \nthrombocytopenia. \nF. Hypertension \nI. High systolic BP following intracranial hc:morrhage is \nassociated with hc:matoma expansion and poor outcomes. \n2. BP lowering has been associated with better outcomes. \n3. Patients with systolic BP 150-220 mm Hg should have \nacute lowering of the systolic BP to 140 mm Hg unless \nthere is a contraindication. \n4. IV antihypertensivc: medication should be considered in \npatients with a systolic BP > 220 mg Hg. \nG. Specific detailed guiddines of potential therapies to treat \nintracerebral hemorrhage, the associated hypertension, \nseizures, reverse anticoagulation, prevent venous throm-\nboembolism, and treat increased intracranial pressure were \npublished in 2015. \n\nAn emergent head CT without contrast Is performed and \nnormal. \nThe normal head CT is reassuring because it markedly decreases \nthe likelihood of 1 of the life-threatening hypotheses, cerebellar \nhemorrhage (sensitivity 93%). However, a diagnosis has not been \nestablished and the evaluation must continue. \nOn reevaluatlon, Mr. W complains of weakness on his left \nside. Neurologlc exam reveals a neflaccid paralysis on the \nleft side. \nThe neneurologic findings coupled with the vertigo, headache, \nneck pain, and recent neck trauma (chiropractic manipulation) \nmake you revise your leading hypotheses to VAD. \nRevised Leading Hypothesis: Vertebral \nArtery Dissection (VAD) \nTcrtbook Presentation \nUnlike patients with atherosclerotic disease, patients with VAD are \nusually younger (mean age 46) and often complain of severe neck \npain, occipital headache, and evolving neurologic symptoms due to \nprogressive involvement of the brainstem. Numbness, hc:mipare-\nsis, quadriparesis, coma, a locked-in syndrome, or death can result \nfrom this uncommon but occasionally devastating illness. \nDisease Highlights \nA. VAD is the leading cause of posterior circulation strokes \namong young adults. \nI. Median age is 43 years. \n2. Accounts for 42% of strokes associated with vertigo in \npatients younger than age 50. \nB. Pathogenesis \nI. The venebral artery passes through foramen within the \ntransverse process ofCl-C6. \n2. As Cl rotates on C2, the vertebral artery can be stretched \nand injured, initiating dissection (which may be \nex.tracranial or intracranial). \n\n3. As blood leaks into the false lwnen, the true lumen is \nnarrowed, which may lead to rostral thromboembolism. \nThe thrombosis may extend to involve the basilar artery \ncompromising the entire brainstem. \n4. Infarction is seen in 65%. \nS. Aneurysm formation can also occur, which may be \ncomplicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage. \nC. Stroke develops in 63% of patients. A good outcome was \nreported in 69%, fair outcome in 18%, and poor outcome \nin 10%. \nD. Risk factors differ from patients with typical ischemic stroke. \nVAD may occur following spotting activities (15% of cases), \nminor trauma, chiropractic manipulation (16% of cases), or \nspontaneously (> 50%). \n1. Examples of sporting activities include jogging, horseback \nriding, tennis, skiing, and others. Given the frequency with \nwhich individuals engage in these activities, it is unclear if \nthis relationship is causal. The average time from the event \nto symptoms is 2-3 days. \n2. It is also unclear if cervical manipulative therapy \n(CMT) causes VAD or if these dissections preexisted the \nmanipulation and patients were seeking CMT to help with \ntheir pain. When associated with CMT, symptoms develop \nwithin 1 hour of procedure in 83% of patients. \nE. Pain (from the dissection) is a common feamre. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Clinical findings \n1. The most common symptoms are headache (51--69%), \nneck pain (46%), and dizziness/vertigo (36-58%) \n(Table 14-11). \n2. Headache or neck pain are seen in 85% of patients. \n3. 13% of patients present with headache and neck pain \nwithout other neurologic symptoms. They may precede \nother neurologic symptoms by hours to weeks. \n4. The onset of headache and neck pain may be gradual or \nsudden. \nTable 14-11.

Neck pain is usually unilateral (= 66% of patients). Patients \nmay have neck tenderness on exam which should not \nremove VAD from consideration. \n6. Isolated vertigo and headache are present in 12% of cases. \nPatients with vertigo and headache or neck pain, \nshould be carefully and emergently evaluated. \nDiagnostic possibilities include migraine, sub-\narachnoid hemorrhage, cerebellar hemorrhage, \nandVAD. \nB. Neuroimaging: VAD can be visualized with MRA, CTA, and \nconventional angiography. \n1. MRA, contrast-enhanced MRI, and CTA are highly \naccurate. CTA is preferred for the diagnosis of dissection, \nalthough MRI is more sensitive at detecting infarction. \n2. Ultrasonography with color Doppler is less sensitive for \nVAD (66%). \nTreatment \nA. For patients with stroke and extracranial cervical arterial \ndissection who meet stringent eligibility criteria for throm-\nbolytic therapy, thrombolytics are \"probably recommended\" \n(2018 AHA/ASA Guideline). Use of thrombolytics in patients \nwith intracranial arterial dissection is uncenain and not well \nestablished. \nB. For other patients with V AD and ischemic stroke or TIA not \nreceiving thrombolytic therapy and without subarachnoid \nhemorrhage, the 2014 AHN ASA guidelines recommend \nanticoagulation or antithrombotic therapy. \nC. For patients with recurrent ischemic events despite medical \ntherapy, endovascular or surgical therapy may be considered. \nD. For patients with aneurysm formation or subarachnoid \nhemorrhage, endovascular repair and surgery have been used. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nAn emergent MRA is performed and reveals a VAD with ne\nevidence of t hrombosis in the left vertebral artery. \nThe MRA confirms VAD. This unusual but very dangerous \ncondition must be treated immediately. \nThe patient 's neweakness suooests neInfarction from \nthe VAD. The patient has no contraindications to thrombo-\nlytic therapY which is started emergently. Two hours later \nhe repor-ts that his weakness has resolved. He Is subse-\nquently treated with aspirin. At follow-up 2 months later, \nhe Is stable and asymptomatic. \nAlthough CNS causes of vertigo are less common, they must \nbe carefully considered in patients with vertigo and neurologic \nsymptoms. A careful neurologic history and exam are of para-\nmount imponance. Mr. W had a less common but life-threatening \ncause of vertigo, which illustrates the need for careful diagnostic \nreasoning. \n\n270 I CHAPTER 14 \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nMeniere Disease \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients complain of intermittent spells of vertigo. They may note \nassociated ear fullness, fluctuating unilateral hearing loss, and \ntinnitus. Spells typically last for minutes to hours (rarely longer \nthan 4-5 hours) and occasionally up to a day. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Associated with excess fluid (hydrops) in the endolymphatic \nspaces of the inner ear. \nB. The disease may be unilateral or bilateral. \nC. Patients have both episodic sensorineural hearing loss and \nvertigo. Patients may also experience tinnitus. \n1. Vertigo lasts 20 minutes to 24 hours. \n2. The hearing loss typically affects lower frequencies initially \nand then progresses. \n3. Tinnitus is often described as lopitch. \n4. Only 38% of patients present with the complete triad. \nPatients may present with any of the 3 symptoms and \ndevelop the others more than 10 years later. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. There are no tests that definitely confirm Meniere disease. The \ndisease is diagnosed clinically. \nB. Diagnostic criteria of the American Academy of Otolaryngol-\nogy and Head and Neck Surgery require the following for a \ndefinite clinical diagnosis: \n1. Two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo lasting \n> 20 minutes \n2. Confirmed sensorineural hearing loss \n3. Tinnitus or perception of aural fullness, or both \n4. Other causes excluded. The utilization of other tests is \ncontroversial. A recent revierecommended an MRI to \nrule out other causes (ie, acoustic neuroma, cerebrovascular \naccident or MS) before confirming the diagnosis. \nC. Dedicated inner ear MRI \n1. Dedicated inner ear MRI protocols can demonstrate \nenlargement of the endolymphatic spaces consistent with \nMeniere disease. However, enlargement may be seen in \nother conditions and is not specific for Meniere disease. \n2. Recommended in patients with suspected Meniere disease \nto both exclude other causes of vertigo and to help confirm \nMeniere disease. \n3. May be especially useful in the subset of patients (20%) \nwho present with vertigo or hearing loss suggestive of \nMeniere disease but who have not yet developed the \nclassic symptom triad and to distinguish Meniere disease \nfrom other causes of episodic vertigo such as vertiginous \nmigraine. \nHearing loss may accompany Meniere disease \nor posterior circulation ischemia (due to infarc-\ntion of the labyrinth) and is not pathogno-\nmonic of Meniere disease. \nD. Audiometry should be performed. \n1. Early Meniere disease is characterized by lofrequency \nsensorineural hearing loss. \n2. Hearing can be normal between attacks. \nE. Test should be done to rule out syphilis (treponemal-specific \nenzyme immunoassay). \nF. Specialized testing is available (eg, electronystagmogram). \nTreatment \nA. Anecdotal evidence suggests low-salt diet and restriction of \ncaffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. \nB. Diuretics and corticosteroids (both oral and intratympanic) \nhave been used but their usefulness is unclear. Diuretics are \nfrequently used when lifestyle changes are inadequate. \nC. Acute vertiginous symptoms can be treated with diphenhy-\ndramine, dimenhydrinate, meclizine, benzodiazepines, or \nantiemetics. \nD. Surgical therapies are available for patients with refractory \nincapacitating symptoms. \nMultiple Sensory Deficits \nTatbook Presentation \nThe typical patient is an elderly diabetic who complains of symp-\ntoms when arising from their bed during the night. Patients may \nfall or simply feel as though they are going to fall. Multiple sen-\nsory losses and physical deconditioning create imbalance and an \nunsteady gait. Orthostatic hypotension (aggravated by many \nmedications) and benzodiazepines for sleep may contribute to the \nsymptoms. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Multiple systems are involved. \nB. Typically, at least 2 or more of the following are present: \n1. Visual loss \na. May develop secondary to myopia, presbyopia, \ncataracts, macular degeneration \nb. The average 80-year-old requires 3 times the lighting to \nsee like a 20-year-old. \nc. Age-rdated changes in the lens decrease color \nperception, decreasing the ability to discriminate objects \nof similar color, increasing the risk of falls. \nd. Glare and accommodation to variations in light \nintensity also worsen with age. \n2. Proprioceptive loss (eg, neuropathy from diabetes, \nmydopathy from cervical spondylosis) \n3. Chronic bilateral vestibular damage (eg, from ototoxic \ndrugs) \n4. Orthopedic disorders impairing ambulation \nEvidence-Based Diagnosia \nA. Ataxia is uncommon (0/14 in 1 series). \nB. Patients with significant ataxia or cerebellar findings should \nundergo MRI to exclude alternative diagnoses. \nTreatment \nA multifaceted approach is often necessary; elements include: \nA. Visual correction \nB. Night lighting \n\nC. Amplify visual contrast by juxtaposing objects of distinctly dif-\nferent colors to highlight boundary zones (eg, floor coverings). \nD. Instructing patients to sit at the edge of the bed prior to \nstanding. \nE. Modifying medications to minimi:ie orthostatic hypotension \n{ie, alpha-blockers, diuretics). \nF. When possible, eliminate benzodia:iepines, neuroleptics, and \nany unnecessary medications. \nG. Home visits can identify f.tll risks (electric and telephone \ncords, loose rugs, etc). \nH. Lower limb strength training and balance training have been \ndemonstrated to reduce falls. \nI. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fractures in patients with \nosteoporosis. \nREFERENCES \nBalcct LJ. Clinical practice. Optic neuritis.

Trowbridge, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. C is a 64-year--old man who comes to see you complain-\ning of shortness of breath. \n~~ \nWhat fe the differential dlagnoeie of dyepnea7 \n~JI\"' Howould you frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe differential diagnosis of dyspnea is extraordinarily broad but \nfollowing a structured and sequential approach to the patient \nwith dyspnea can allofor the rapid identification of common \nand serious disorders while also ensuring that other causes are not \nmissed. Heart disease and lung disease constitute the most com-\nmon serious causes of dyspnea, specifically heart failure (HF), \npneumonia, obstructive lung disease (chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease [COPD] and asthma), and pulmonary embolism \n(PE}. These four conditions should always be on the differential \ndiagnosis for dyspnea and at the forefront of the clinician's mind \nin evaluating the dyspneic patient. A series of other less common \ndisorders represent an immediate risk to life and must also be con-\nsidered in the very early stages of investigation, as urgent treatment \nmay be necessary. These diagnoses can be remembered using the \nACT ASAP mnemonic (Table 15-1}. \nOnce these common and life-threatening disorders have been \nconsidered, a more systematic approach to the many other causes \nof dyspnea can proceed. The simplest approach to constructing the \nbroad differential diagnosis is to consider the anatomic components \nof each of these systems, specifically the route of inspired air and \noxygen through the cardiopulmonary system and the rest of the \nbody. This allows us to devdop a fairly comprehensive differential \ndiagnosis of dyspnea. \nDifferential Diagnosis of Dyspnea \nA. Lung \n1. Airways \na.

Hyperthyroidism \nA key issue to keep in mind when evaluating a patient with dys-\npnea is that multiple potential causes are often present in a single \npatient. Patients with COPD, for example, are at increased risk for \npneumonia, pneumothorax, PE, and lung cancer. Thus, a patient \nwith known COPD presenting with acute dyspnea may have an \nuncomplicated exacerbation of the underlying COPD secondary \nto continued tobacco use, or the worsening symptoms may he sec-\nondary to the development of a complication (such as pneumonia) \nthat has also caused an exacerbation of the underlying COPD. \nIn this case, both the COPD and the pneumonia are responsible \nfor the increase in dyspnea. Similarly, patients with HF often have \nor are at risk for other common causes of dyspnea, including con-\ncomitant valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. \nThe extensive differential diagnosis for dyspnea and the pos-\nsibility of several contributory causes necessitates a careful and \ndetailed history and physical exam and revieof basic laboratory \nexams. The history should detail the time course of the dyspnea, \nits severity, and associated symptoms. The past medical history \nshould cover the predisposing factors for common causes of dys-\npnea (eg, immunosuppression for pneumonia) and the social and \noccupational hazards associated with specific disorders (eg, tobacco \nuse for COPD and occupational exposures for interstitial lung \ndisease). The physical exam should include vital signs, a detailed \ncardiac and pulmonary exam, and a search for signs suggestive of \nanemia and other systemic diseases. In addition, almost all patients \nwith new-onset or worsening dyspnea should have a chest film, \nECG, and hematocrit. Unlike some other patient presentations, \nhowever, there are feindividual signs or symptoms whose pres-\nence is highly suggestive of a specific diagnosis or whose absence \nrules out a diagnosis. Instead, it is often the combination of history, \nsigns and symptoms, augmented by basic testing, that suggests a \ndiagnosis (Table 15-2). \nAs is usually the case in diagnosis, the history is the most impor-\ntant component of the evaluation of a patient with dyspnea. Of \ncritical importance is reviewing the risk factors for the causes of \ndyspnea. Feacures that suggest HF, for example, include a history \nof myocardial infarction (Ml), CAD risk factors, long-standing \nuncontrolled hypertension, or alcohol abuse. PE should he con-\nsidered in patients with risk factors, such as recent hospitalization \nor immobilization, surgery, a history of cancer, or use of estrogen. \nIn obtaining the history, a focus should he placed on the \npresence of chest pain (covered in Chapter 9), which is a pivotal \ndiagnostic clue in patients with dyspnea (Table 15-2). Chest pain \nmay he pleuritic or nonpleuritic and acute or chronidrecurrent. \nEach of these features can help focus the differential diagnosis \n(Table 15-3). In general, pleuritic chest pain helps focus the search \non a pulmonary cause of dyspnea such as pneumonia, PE, and \npneumothorax. Nonpleuritic chest pain evokes a broader differ-\nential and includes both those diseases that cause pleuritic chest \npain and other etiologies such as MI, aonic stenosis, and aortic \ndissection. The acuity of the chest pain can also help narrothe \ndifferential diagnosis. Common causes of dyspnea associated with \nacute chest pain include MI, aortic dissection, PE, pneumothorax, \narrhythmias (causing angina), and pneumonia. Common causes \nof dyspnea associated with chronic/recurrent chest pain include \nangina (caused by CAD, severe anemia, or aortic stenosis), asthma \nor COPD (which are often associated with chest tightness), and \nrecurrent intermittent arrhythmias. \nOtherwise there is significant overlap between the presentations \nof the common causes of dyspnea as many symptoms occur in mul-\ntiple otherwise seemingly unrelated causes. Fever, for example, may \noccur in pneumonia, asthma or COPD with concomitant infec-\ntion, valvular heart disease due to endocarditis, PE, acute respira-\ntory distress syndrome, and interstitial lung disease. Similarly, the \nlack of a fever is only a modestly strong argument against any of \nthese disorders as the cause of dyspnea. Cough similarly occurs in \nmany diseases, including pneumonia, HF, COPD, and interstitial \nlung disease, and is of limited usefulness in terms of differentiating \namong the different causes of dyspnea. \nA detailed physical exam should he particularly focused on \nthe presence of key pivotal findings, specifically jugular venous \ndistention, s3, egophony with bronchial breath sounds, and \ncrackles. The presence of jugular venous distention is an impor-\ntant discovery and suggests the diagnoses of HF, tamponade or \nPE. If an S, is present in a nonpregnant patient over the age \nof 30, HF is likely. Egophony and bronchial breath sounds are \nsuggestive of pneumonia. The presence of crackles is less specillc \nbut suggest a pulmonary or cardiac cause and are classically asso-\nciated with pneumonia, HF, and interstitial lung disease. Most \nimportantly, although the presence of any of these pivotal find-\nings on exam can be helpful, their absence does not rule out any \nof these diagnoses. \nPoint-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly being rec-\nognized as a useful addition the clinical examination in the \npatient with dyspnea. Findings such as the absence of a sliding lung \n(pneumothorax) and B-lines (HF) may substantially increase the \nlikelihood of specific disorders. Incorporating POCUS findings \ninto the evaluation of the dyspneic patient, however, is dependent \non the availability of an experienced operator (Table 15-4). \nIn most patients, a chest film is necessary to hdp delineate the \ncauses of dyspnea. As is the case with other clinical characteris-\ntics, however, there is substantial overlap and variability in the \nradiographic findings of disease. A normal chest radiograph makes \npneumonia, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome unlikely and rules out pneumothorax (Table 15-5). \nFocal infiltrate(s) suggest pneumonia and can also he seen with \nlung cancer and PE. Diffuse infiltrates or edema may he seen in \na variety of settings including any cause of HF, acute respiratory \n\nDYSPNEA I 275 \nTable 15-2.

Mr. C's risk factors, symptoms, and \nsigns immediately focus the differential diagnosis. His past history \nof MI is a clear risk factor for HF. Furthermore, the combination \nof ]VD, S gallop, crackles, and peripheral edema are all very sug-\ngestive of HF making it the leading hypothesis. His physical exam \nalso reveals a heart murmur raising several alternative diagnoses \n(ie, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, or aonic regurgitation). \nThe location of this murmur is most consistent with mitral regur-\ngitation. Mr. C's irregular pulse also raises the possibiliry of atrial \nfibrillation. Finally, cardiac ischemia presenting as dyspnea rather \nthan pain is a must not miss possibility.

Often, there is an \nantecedent history of either MI or poorly controlled hypertension. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. HF refers to any cardiac pathology that impairs left ventricu-\nlar (LV) filling or ejection, which may arise from diseases or \ndysfunction of the myocardium, valves, or pericardium. The \nremainder of this discussion will focus on myocardial causes \nof HF. Valvular heart disease is discussed separately. \nB. Affects 6.5 million patients in the United States and \naccounts for 900,000 hospitalizations and 75,000 deaths \nannually. At age 45, lifetime risk of heart failure is 27.4% \nin men and 23.8% in women. The risk ofHFrEF is higher \nin men than in women although the risk of HFpEF is equal \nbetween genders. \nC. Pathophysiologic classification: HF may occur in patients \nwith impaired emptying (and an ejection fraction S 40%) or \nimpaired filling (with a preserved ejection fraction~ 50%). \nThe distinction is important because both the etiologies and \ntreatments of these 2 groups are different. HF may also be \nclassified based on whether the primary process affects the LY \nor the right ventricle (RV). \n1. HFrEF \na. Previously called systolic HF or systolic dysfunction, \nHFrEF accounts for approximately 50% of cases of HF. \nb. HFrEF develops when systolic dysfunction impairs LV \nemptying. \nc. CAD is the most common cause ofHFrEF. \ncl. Other common causes include long-standing \nhypertension and alcohol abuse. \ne. Less common causes include viral cardiomyopathy, \npostpartum cardiomyopathy, drug toxicity (eg, \nadriamycin), persistent tachycardia, and idiopathic \ncardiomyopathy. \n2. HFpEF \na. Previously referred to as diastolic HF, HFpEF accounts \nfor approximately 50% of all HF cases. \nb. HFpEF develops when an increase in myocardial muscle \nmass (thickness), infiltration, or fibrosis decreases LY \ncompliance. \n(1) Decreased LV compliance impairs LV filling. \n(2) Note that although LV filling is compromised, \ncontractility is preserved and the ejection fraction \nis normal. \nc. The most common cause ofHFpEF is hypertension. \ncl. Less common causes include \n(1) Aortic stenosis \n(2) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \n\n278 I CHAPTER 15 \nDyspn1111 \nConsider 4 most common causas: \nHF, COPDlaslhma, PE, pn9Ur11onla \nYes \nPleurltla ahal pmln \n- Pneumonia \n- PE \n- Pneumothorax \n- Exudallve pllual effusion \nNo \nNonpleurttlc chMI f191n \n- Myocardial iechemiafrlarction \n- Aortic dissection \n- All cau- ol pleurlllc chest pain \nDrmlne risk faclors, 11- for \nllBllOCialed aymptome, signs \nIncorporate POCUS findings \nif available \nConsider addftional testing: \nechocardiogram, PFTs, D-dimar, BNP \nYes \n>----~ Treat consider concomitant cause \nAcute \nNo \nPneumonia \nConsider aculll must not miss clagnoses: \nACT ASAP \nAnhythmls, ACS, la'nponade \nAllway obstruction, stenosls (aortic) \nanaphylaxis, pneumolhorax \nCrackas \nHF \nPneumonia \nILD \nACS, acute coronary syndrome; ACT ASAP, arrhythmia, coronary syndrome (acute), tamponada, airway obstruction, stanosls (aortic), snaphylaxls, pnaumothorax; \nBNP, brain natriuretic peptide; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ECG, electrocardiogram; HF, hean failure; ILD, interstitial lung disease; \nJVD, jugular venous distention; PE, pulmonary embolism; PFTs, pulmonary function tests; POCUS, point of care ultrasound. \nFigure 15-1.

Patients with ejection fraction of 41-49% are classified \nas HFpEF, borderline. Their treatment and outcomes are \nsimilar to patients with HFpEF. \n5. Right- versus left-sided HF \na. HF may involve the LV, the RV, or both. \nb. Common causes ofLV failure include CAD, \nhypertension, and alcoholic cardiomyopathy. \nc. Common causes of RV failure include advanced LY \nfailure and severe pulmonary disease, such as COPD \n(cor pulmonale). \nd. A key distinguishing feature between right- and left-\nsided HF is that pulmonary edema, common in LY \nfailure, is not a featUre of isolated RV failure. \nc. Peripheral edema, ]VD, and fatigue may be seen in \nLY or RV failure. \n\nTable 15-9.

HF triggers maladaptive neurohormonal changes \nincluding increased activation of the renin~angiotensin~ \naldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system. \nb. These neurohormonal responses promote sodium \nretention, increase afterload, and contribute to volume \noverload and progressive HF. \nc. Therapies that interrupt these responses reduce mortality. \nD. Classifications of HF \n1. NeYork Heart Association (NYHA) \na.

Limited by the ability of patients to move from 1 class \nto another with therapy. \nDYSPNEA I 279 \n2. American College of Cardiology Foundation/ American \nHeart Association (ACCF/AHA) stages of HF were \ndeveloped to fucilitate identifying stage~speciflc therapies. \na. Stage A: Patients at high risk for HF without \nstructural heart disease or symptoms (eg, patients with \nhypertension or CAD but normal LV function). \nb. Stage B: Patients with structural heart disease (eg, LV \nhypertrophy or decreased ejection fraction) without \nsigns or symptoms of HF. \nc. Stage C: Structural heart disease and prior or current \nsymptoms. \nd. Stage D: Refractory HF symptoms despite therapy. \nE. Complications of HF \n1. Electrical: Heart block, ventricular tachycardia, atrial \nfibrillation, sudden death \n2. Pulmonary edema \n3. Stroke and thromboembolism \na. 2-4% annual incidence \nb.

The history should assess risk factors for HF, including hyper-\ntension, CAD, alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, and adriamycin \nexposure. \nB. Classic symptoms and signs include dyspnea on exertion, \northopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, an s3 gallop, ]VD, \nandedema. \n1. Although the presence of any of these should prompt \nconsideration of HF, none of the signs or symptoms \nare sensitive enough to rule out HF when absent \n(Table 15-10). Indeed, even in severe chronic HF (mean \nejection fraction 18%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure \n[PCWP] > 22 mm Hg), 42% of patients did not have \ncrackles, increased JVP, or edema. \n~ \nSigns of HF are commonly absent even in \n,.,.... advanced HF. \n2. Classic symptoms such as orthopnea, paroxysmal \nnocturnal dyspnea, and crackles are also not specific \nfor HF (LR+, 2.2-2.6). \n3. However, certain findings are highly specific for HF and \nstrongly suggest HF when present, including an S3 gallop \n(LR+, 11) and]VD (LR+, 5.1). \n.a. s3 gallop \n(1) Occurs when a large volume of blood rushes from \nthe left atrium (LA) into the LV at the start of \ndiastole (just after S2). \n(2) May occur normally in pregnant or young patients \n(under age of 30) \n\n280 I CHAPTER 15 \nTable 15-10.

The absence of these findings or the presence of massive \nunilateral or bilateral pleural effusions suggests a \ndifferent etiology and warrants further evaluation. \n4. Table 15-11 summarizes the accuracy of the chest \nradiograph in the diagnosis of HF. \nD.

The accuracy of the BNP is summarized in Table 15-12. \n7. BNP is also elevated in many patients with pulmonary \nembolus (average 702 ng/L, and 1876 ng/L in patients with \ncentral PE (in the main pulmonary trunk or left or right \nmain pulmonary arteries). \nTable 15-12.

The ACCF/AHA concluded that elevated BNP levels lend \nweight to a diagnosis of HF but should not be used in \nisolation to confirm or exclude HF. \nF. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) can provide valuable \ninformation on the likelihood of HF. \n1. Internal medicine residents with limited training can \naccurately identify patients with ejection fraction < 40% \n(sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 94%; LR+, 15.7; LR-, 0.06). \n2. For acute HF, B-lines have an LR+ of7.4 and an LR-\nof0.16. \nG. Two-dimensional echocardiogram is the test of choice to \ndiagnose HF and is recommended for all patients with \nknown or suspected HF. \n1. Systolic and diastolic function can be evaluated. \n2. Regional systolic dysfunction suggests an ischemic etiology. \n3. Valve function can be assessed. \nH. Radionuclide tests can quantify ejection fraction but cannot \nassess LV wall thickness or valvular abnormalities. \nI. Cardiac MR is another option for the evaluation of HF, \nalthough it is more expensive and more difficult to perform \nthan echocatdiography. \n1. Cardiac MR can accurately measure ejection fraction and \nLV volume as well as assess myocardial perfusion, viability, \nand fibrosis. \n2. Most appropriate in the initial evaluation of patients with \nneor suspected HF secondary to restrictive or pericardia! \ndisease. \n3. Cardiac MR combined with magnetic resonance \nangiography and gadolinium enhancement can detect \nunderlying CAD and ischemia {sensitivity 100%, \nspecificity 96% in patients in sinus rhythm). \nJ. HF and COPD \n1. Share some of the same risk factors and may coexist \n2. The diagnosis of HF is more difficult in patients with \nCOPD. \na. Studies report unsuspected HF in ~ 21 % of patients \nwith COPD. These patients had fewer pack years of \ntobacco use than patients without HF (9.6 vs 22.7). \nb. Pleural fluid, pulmonary revascularization, and edema \nwere uncommon even in the subgroup with HF (9.1 %) \nbut strongly suggested HF (LR+ 9.1) when present. \nc. BNP is less sensitive in patients with COPD (sensitivity, \n35%; specificity, 90%; LR+, 3.5; LR-, 0.72). \nTreatment \nClinicians should have a lothreshold for \nobtaining an echocardiogram in patients with \nCOPD and dyspnea. \nA. Prevention: Hypertension therapy decreases the incidence of \nHF by 30-50%. \nB. Evaluation \n1. Initial history and physical exam should assess functional \ncapacity and volume status (weight, vital signs, lung exam, \n]VD, S3 gallop, and edema). \n2. Routine laboratory tests recommended by the ACCF/AHA \na. CBC \nb. Urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine \nDYSPNEA I 281 \nc. Electrolytes \nd. Lipid panel, glycohemoglobin, liver biochemical tests \ne. Thyroid-stimulating hormone \nf. Chest radiograph \ng. ECG \nh. Echocardiogram \n3. Evaluation of CAD \na. HF develops secondary to ischemia in approximately \ntwo-thirds of patients with HFrEF. \nb. Identifying underlying CAD allows clinicians to \noptimize medical therapy and identify which patients \ncan benefit from revascularization. Some patients \nmay experience an increase in ejection fraction with \nrevascularization. \nc. CAD should be suspected in patients with chest pain, \nCAD risk factors, ischemic ECG findings, or regional \nwall motion abnormalities on noninvasive imaging. \nd. Stress test or angiography can be used depending on \nthe pretest probability of CAD. \nC. Treatment \nI. Certain treatments benefit all patients with HF whereas \nothers have greater proven efficacy in patients with HFrEF. \n2. All HF patients \na. Sodium restriction is recommended for all HF patients. \nA high sodium diet is associated with a marked increase \nin acute decompensated HF (an absolute increased risk \n31-34%, NNH\"\" 3), hospitalizations, and all-cause \nmortality. \nb. Diuretics (loop or thiazides) \n(1) Loop diuretics are mainstay of therapy to treat \nedema and pulmonary congestion (and should be \nused in combination with salt restriction). Thiazides \nmay be useful in patients with mild disease and \npreserved kidney function. \n(2) The clinical assessment of volume status is critical. \nVolume overload may be suggested by edema, \nweight gain, JVD, pulmonary edema, or an \nS, gallop. \n(3) However, multiple studies demonstrate that despite \nsevere chronic HF and marked volume overload \n(measured by PCWP) patients may not have signs \nof HF. \n(4) Therefore, dyspneic HF patients should undergo \naggressive diuresis while kidney function is \nmonitored. \n(5) LV filling pressures can also be indirectly estimated \nusing POCUS evaluation of the inferior vena cava \n(IVC). \n(a) POCUS can measure IVC diameter and \ncollapsibility with inspiration. \n(b) HF (right or left) is associated with an increase \nin IVC diameter and a decrease in the normal \ncollapsibility with inspiration. \n(c) IVC diameter > 2.0 cm suggests elevated PCWP \n~ 17 mm Hg (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 83%; \nLR+ 4.4; LR-, 0.3). \n(d) IVC collapsibility< 45% suggests elevated \nPCWP ~ 17 mm Hg (sensitivity, 83%; \nspecificity, 71%; LR+ 2.9; LR-, 0.24). \n(e) IVC measurements may prove useful as an \nadjunct to determine the need for further \n\n282 I CHAPTER 15 \ndiuresis. Larger NC diameters and less \ncollapsibility on discharge predicted the \nsubsequent need for readmission. \n(6) Input and output, daily weights, lung and cardiac \nexam, electrolytes, BUN and creatinine should be \nmonitored daily in hospitalized patients. \nc. Control of hypertension. Angiotensin-converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors are especially useful since they \nhave the dual indication for hypertension and HF. \nd. CAD revascularization: Coronary artery bypass surgery \ncan improve cardiovascular outcomes in select patients \nwith CAD and HF. Recommendations include the \nfollowing: \n(1) Should be considered in patients who have HF \n(HFrEF or HFpEF) with angina and left main \nstenosis or left main equivalent disease \n(2) Recommended for select patients with HFrEF and \nmultivessel or proximal left anterior descending \n(LAD) disease \ne. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination \nf. Avoidance of specific medications that increase fluid \nretention and are associated with worsening and \nprecipitating HF (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \nand thiazolidinediones). \n3. Patients with HFrEF \na. Therapy with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, \naldosterone antagonists, and hydralazine combined \nwith nitrates have been shown to reduce morbidity and \nmortality in patients with HFrEF. \nb. ACE inhibitors \n(1) Indicated in patients with HFrEF or patients with \na prior MI. ACE inhibitors have been shown to \nreduce mortality in all patients with HFrEF and \nmay decrease rates of MI. \n(2) Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are indicated \nin patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors due to \ncough. However, other side effects seen with ACE \ninhibitors (such as hyperkalemia or angioedema) \nmay also occur with ARBs. \nc. Beta-blockers \n(1) Beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in all \nstages of HF, including severe HF (ejection fraction \n< 25%). \n(2) Indicated in patients with HFrEF or patients with a \nprior MI. \n(3) Beta-blockers with proven efficacy include \ncarvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol, and \nbisoprolol. \n(4) Other beta-blockers, including short-acting \nmetoprolol, should not be used for HF. \n(5) Initiate therapy at lodoses, when patients are \neuvolemic and not requiring inotropes. \n(6) Beta-blockers can precipitate fatal asthma and \nshould be avoided in patients with severe or \ndecompensated reactive airway disease. Selective \nbeta-1-agonists can be used with caution in patients \nwith controlled reactive airway disease. \nd. Aldosterone antagonist (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone) \n(1) Reduces mortality in patients with class II-N HF \nand ejection fraction S 35% (< 40% with prior MI) \n(2) Should be avoided in patients with a glomerular \nfiltration rate s 30 mL/min, K+ <!: 5.0 mEq/dL, or \npatients who cannot have their serum potassium \nadequately monitored \ne. Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) \nsacubitril-valsartan \n(1) Neprilysin inhibitors prevent degradation of \nbeneficial natriuretic peptides; used in combination \nwithARBs \n(2) May decrease mortality and HF hospitalization \ncompared to ACE inhibitors but is often associated \nwith symptomatic hypotension \n(3) Consider as a replacement for ACE inhibitors, \nespecially in patients with continued symptoms \ndespite optimal therapy \nf. Ivabradine \n(1) Directly affects the sinus node and slows the \nsinus rate \n(2) May be useful in patients with a heart rate \n> 70 bpm on maximal beta-blocker therapy \ng. Statins should be used in patients with HFrEF and \nCAD. \nh. Hydralazine and nitrates, in addition to ACE inhibitors \nand beta-blockers \n(1) Have been demonstrated to reduce mortality in \nblack patients with class III or N HF \n(2) May also be useful in patients who are unable to \ntolerate ACE inhibitors/ ARBs \ni. Digoxin \n(1) Reduces hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF \nbut not mortality \n(2) Loserum concentrations (0.5--0.8 mg/dL} are as \neffective as higher concentrations. \n(3) ACCF/AHA guidelines recommend digoxin only in \nsymptomatic patients with HFrEF. \n(4) Digoxin may increase mortality in women and is not \nadvised for women by some authorities. \nj. Cardiac resynchronization therapy: Some patients with \nHF have prolonged QRS intervals, associated with \nprolonged and dyssynchronous depolarization. This \nnonuniform depolarization results in poorly organired \ncontraction and contributes to LY dysfunction. In \naddition, it contributes to mitral regurgitation and \nLY remodeling. \n(1) In cardiac resynchronization, wires are implanted \nin the atria and both ventricles to alloprecise and \ncoordinated depolarization of the atria and left and \nright ventricles. \n(2) Cardiac resynchronization therapy improves \nejection fraction, quality of life, and functional \nstatus, and it reduces hospitalizations and mortality \nin select patients. \n(3) Indications are complex and detailed but include \npatients with symptomatic HF despite optimal \nmedical therapy, an ejection fraction s 35% and a \nQRS <!: 0.15 s {and in certain patients<!: 0.12 s). \nk. Implantable cardiac defibrillator \n(1) A substantial proportion of patients with HF \nexperience sudden death {30% in dilated \n\ncardiomyopathy), presumably secondary to \nventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. \n(2) Implantable cardiac defibrillators are recommended \nin the following select HF patients: \n(a) Patients who have survived cardiac arrest, \nventricular fibrillation, or hernodynamically \ndestabilizing ventricular tachycardia \n(b) Symptomatic HF patients (NYHA class II-III) \nwith ischemic or nonischemic HFrEF with \nejection fractions 35%, at least 40 days post \nMI while taking appropriate therapy \n(c) Asymptomatic patients with ischemic HF and \nan ejection fraction S 30%, at least 40 days post \nMI while taking appropriate medical therapy \n(d) Placement could be considered in HF patients \nwith unexplained syncope. \nI. Heart transplantation is an option for patients with \nsevere HF refractory to intensive medical therapy. \n4. Patients with HFpEF \na. The effectiveness of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or \nARBs in patients with HFpEF is not well established. \n(1) None have been shown to decrease mortality, \nalthough ARBs may decrease hospitalizations in \npatients with HFpEF. \n(2) Therapy should concentrate on controlling \nsymptoms and comorbidities, including \nhypertension. \nb. Systolic and diastolic hypertension should be controlled. \nc. Diuretics can be used to treat pulmonary congestion or \nedema. \nd. Control ventricular rate for patients with atrial \nfibrillation. \ne. Digoxin has no proven benefit. \n5. See ACCF/AHA guiddines for the treatment of patients \nwith refractory HF and cardiogenic shock. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr.Chas several features that are highly specific for HF. \nHis histof)' of prior Ml, orthopnea, and most importantly \nthe clinical findings of JVD and an 5:3 gallop are highly spe-\ncific for HF. \nHave you cros5Bd a dlagnoetlc thnsshold for \nthe ludlng hypothHls, HF7 Have you rulet.I \nout the active alternatives? Do other tests \nneat.I to be done to e><cluds the alternative \ndiagnoses? \nAlternative Diagnosis: Chronic \nMitral Regurgitation \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with mitral regurgitation may be identified by hearing a \nholosystolic murmur at the apex in an asymptomatic patient or \nduring an evaluation of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, \nedema, orthopnea, and fatigue. Alternatively, it may be discovered \nduring the evaluation of patients with atrial fibrillation. \nDYSPNEA I 283 \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Trivial asymptomatic mitral regurgitation is commonly discov-\nered on echocardiogram. The remainder of the discussion will \nfocus on patients with more significant regurgitation. \nB. Etiologies: Mitral regurgitation devdops secondary to either \ndamaged mitral leaflets (primary) or a dilated mitral annulus \n(secondary). \n1. Primary mitral regurgitation \na. Etiologies: mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart \ndisease, and endocarditis. \nb. Although most patients with mitral valve prolapse never \nrequire valve replacement, mitral valve prolapse may cause \nmitral regurgitation, progress, and is the most common \nreason for mitral valve replacement in the developed world. \n2. Secondary mitral regurgitation \na. HF: LY dilatation can lead to mitral annular dilatation \nand mitral regurgitation. \nb. Ischernic mitral regurgitation: Leaflet tethering shortens \nthe mitral apparatus, resulting in mitral regurgitation. \nC. Pathophysiology \n1. Compensated mitral regurgitation: \na. Mitral regurgitation in systole leads to LA dilatation \nand compensatory LY dilatation (necessary to maintain \nadequate forward flodespite the retrograde ejection of \nblood across the incompetent mitral valve). \nb. When systolic function is maintained, ejection &action \nremains normal to high and LY end-systolic volume \nremains lobecause mitral regurgitation reduces LY \nafterload. \n2. Decompensated mitral regurgitation: Systolic function may \neventually fail leading to increased LY end systolic volume, \ndecreased stroke volume, and decreased ejection fraction. \nSystolic dysfunction may be irreversible. \n3. LA dilatation may lead to atrial fibrillation. \nD. Typically, chronic mitral regurgitation progresses slowly. \nAverage delay from diagnosis to symptoms is 16 years. \nHowever, in patients with severe mitral regurgitation, the \nannual mortality is 5%. \nE. Acute mitral regurgitation, which may occur in endocarditis or \nMI complicated by papillary muscle rupture, is poorly tolerated \nsince compensatory changes have not had time to develop. \nF. Complications of both acute and chronic mitral regurgitation \ninclude the following: \n1. Dyspnea \n2. Pulmonary ederna \n3. Atrial fibrillation \n4. Sudden death \nEvidence--Based Diagnosis \nA. Physical exam: The typical murmur is a blowing, holosystolic \nmurmur heard at the apex that radiates to the axilla. s2 may be \ninaudible. \n1. Grade 3 or louder systolic murmur for moderate to severe \nmitral regurgitation \na. Sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 81 % \nb. LR+, 4.5; LR-, 0.2 \n2. s3 gallop may be heard due to increased floacross the \nmitral valve. \n\n284 I CHAPTER 15 \nB. ECG \n1. May demonstrate LA enlargement or LY hypertrophy \n2. Is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis \nC. Chest radiograph \n1. May demonstrate LA or LY enlargement \n2. Is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis \nD. Echocardiography \n1. Test of choice to diagnose and quantify mitral regurgitation \n2. Recommended in all patients with suspected mitral \nregurgitation \nE. Transesophageal echocardiography \n1. Provides more precise details on valve anatomy \n2. May hdp determine whether valve repair (versus \nreplacement) is an option \nTreatment \nA. Serial echocardiography \n1. Serial echocardiography is important to detect signs of LV \ndysfonction, which may occur despite the absence of symptoms. \n2. Echocardiography is recommended when there is a change \nin signs or symptoms in patients with any degree of miual \nregurgitation. Otherwise, echocardiography should be \ncompleted semi-annually or annually in patients with \nmoderate to severe mitral regurgitation and every 3-5 years \nin patients with mild mitral regurgitation. \nB. Valve repair versus replacement \n1. When technically feasible, valve repair is superior to valve \nreplacement in patients with primary miual regurgitation \n2. Valve repair is associated with substantially decreased \noperative mortality (2% vs 6%), a lower rate oflater \nendocarditis, and a significantly better ejection fraction. \nImportantly, valve repair does not require subsequent \nanticoagulation. \nC. ACCF/AHA guidelines for valve surgery are summarized \nbelow. \n1. Miual valve surgery is reserved for patients with severe \nprimary mitral regurgitation based on the following: \na. Symptoms, especially if ejection fraction > 30% \nb. Asymptomatic patients \n(1) Mild to moderate LY dysfunction: (ejection fraction \n30-60% and/or, LV end-systolic diameter ~ 40 mm) \n(2) Normal but decreasing LY function or normal \nbut increasing LY end-systolic diameter on serial \nechocardiograms \n(3) Atrial fibrillation or pulmonary hypertension with \nhigh likelihood of surgical success and losurgical \nrisk \n(4) Chronic severe primary mitral regurgitation \nundergoing other cardiac surgery (eg, coronary \nartery bypass grafting) \n2. The optimal strategy for patients with severe mitral \nregurgitation accompanied by severe LY dysfunction \n(ejection fraction < 30%, LY end-systolic diameter \n> 55 mm) is unclear. Such patients may not benefit from \nsurgery due to irreversible LY dysfunction. Furthermore, \nmitral valve repair or replacement increases LY afterload \n(by preventing ejection of blood from the LY to the LA) \nand may worsen HF. \n3. Patients receiving a mechanical mitral valve replacement \nrequire lifelong anticoagulation with a VKA (target \nINR 3.0) in addition to aspirin {75-100 mg/day). \n4. Patients undergoing prosthrnc valve replacement at lo\nrisk for bleeding should receive a VKA (target INR 2.5) \nfor 3-6 months following surgery followed by aspirin \n(75-100 mg/day). \nD. Medical therapy of miual regurgitation \n1. Chronic primary asymptomatic mitral regurgitation with \npreserved LV function: No medical therapy has been \ndemonstrated to be useful. \n2. Secondary miual regurgitation: \na. Optimize HF regimen. \nb. ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers (particularly carvedilol, \nmetoprolol sucdnate, or bisoprolol), diuretics, and \nsometimes digoxin can be useful. \nc. Biventricular pacing reduces the severity of miual \nregurgitation but is not considered a primary \ntreatment. \n3. Miual regurgitation with hypertension: Treat hypertension \nwith ACE inhibitors, diuretics, or beta-blockers. \n4. Treat underlying ischemia. \n5. Endocarditis prophylaxis \na. Recommended prior to dental procedures for patients \nfollowing miual valve replacement with a mechanical or \nbioprosthetic device and for repairs using a bioprosthetic \nannuloplasty ring and chords \nb. Also recommended for patients with a history of \nendocarditis \nAlternative Diagnosis: Chronic \nAortic Regurgitation \nTatbook Presentation \nPatients with chronic aortic regurgitation typically complain of \nprogressive dyspnea on exertion or the sensation of a pounding \nheart. Alternatively, the patient may be asymptomatic, and the \ndiagnosis may be suspected when a careful examiner detects an \nearly diastolic murmur. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Secondary to damaged aortic leaflets or dilated aortic root \nB. Etiologies \n1. Valvular abnormalities: \na. Rheumatic carditis \nb. Bacterial endocarditis \nc. Collagen vascular disease \nd. Calciflc degeneration \ne. Medications (fenfluramine and phentermine) \n2. Aortic root dilatation: \na. Hypertension \nb. Ascending aortic aneurysm \nc. Marfan syndrome \nd. Aortic dissection \ne. Syphilitic aortitis \n3. Bicuspid aortic valve disease \na. Most common form of congenital heart disease affecting \n1 % of population, often transmitted in an autosomal \ndominant pattern with variable penetrance \n\nb. Affects the aortic: valve and the aorta, most commonly \ncausing aortic: stenosis. \nc. Aonic regurgitation may result from primary valve \nchanges or dilation of the proximal ascending aorta \nsecondary to associated cystic: medial necrosis of aorta \nindependent of the valve disease. \nd. Aortic: disease also associated with aneurysm and dissec:tion. \nC. Pathophysiology \n1. Compensation: \na. Regurgitation results in LV remodeling and LV \nhypertrophy (ec:c:entric and concentric) to maintain wall \nstress and ejection fraction. \nb. LV end-diastolic volume increases to augment the stroke \nvolume so that forward floremains in the normal \nrange despite the regurgitant volume. \nc. During the compensated stage, systolic function is \npreserved and both the ejection fraction and LV end-\nsystolic volumes are normal. \n2. Decompensation: \na. The increasing preload and afterload may eventually \nresult in LV systolic dysfunction, as evidenced by a \ndecreasing ejection fraction and an increase in LV end-\nsystolic volume. \nb. These are critical markers suggesting LV \ndecompensation (and the need for surgical \nintervention). \nc. LV end-diastolic pressure increases and pulmonary \ncongestion and dyspnea result. Exertional angina may \nalso occur. \nd. LV dysfunction can become irreversible. Valve \nreplacement should be performed before irreversible LV \ndysfunction and HF develop. \ne. Progression to symptoms or LV dysfunction in patients \nwith normal LV function develops in 4% of patients per \nyear. Sudden death occurs in 0.2% per year. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The pulse pressure (systolic:-diastollc BP) is often wide in \naortic regurgitation due to 2 processes. First, the large stroke \nvolume increases the systolic BP, and second, the regurgitation \nof blood back into the LY rapidly lowers the diastolic BP. \n1. The wide pulse pressure causes many of the classic physical \nfindings, such as bounding pulses and head bobbing; none \nof the classic peripheral findings of aortic regurgitation \n(eg, Corrigan pulse, Duroziez sign) are very helpful in \ndetermining presence or severity of disease (LR+, 2.1; \nLR-, 0.8). \n2. Wide pulse pressures (typically defined as systolic BP-\ndiastolic BP ~ SO% of systolic BP) are not specific for aortic \nregurgitation. Other causes include anemia, fever, pregnancy, \nlarge arteriovenous fistula, cirrhosis, thyrotmdc:osis, and \npatent ductus arteriosa. Elderly patients with systolic \nhypertension commonly have a widened pulse pressure. \nB. Auscultation \n1. May demonstrate an early decrescendo diastolic murmur \nfollowing S2 Best heard at the left sternal border. \na. Sensitivity depends on severity and examiner level of \ntraining. \n(1) Sensitivity for mild to moderate aortic regurgitation: \nonly 4-14% among nonc:ardiologist attending \nphysicians \nDYSPNEA I 285 \n(2) Sensitivity for moderate to severe aortic regurgitation: \n0-64% among students and residents \n(3) Sensitivity for moderate to severe aortic regurgitation: \n80-9S% among experienced cardiologists \nb. A diastolic murmur is highly specific (98%). \n~ \nA diastolic murmur is always abnormal and \n,,.. warrants evaluation with echocardiography. \n2. A systolic murmur suggesting aortic stenosis may be heard. \na. The increased cardiac output resulting from increased \nforward flomay exceed the capacity of even a \nnonstenotic aortic: valve to acc:ommodate flow, \nresulting in a high-flosystolic murmur across the \naortic valve. \nb. One study reported that S 1 % of patients with mild to \nmoderate aortic regurgitation had a systolic murmur \n(86% in moderate aortic regurgitation and 50% in mild \naortic regurgitation). \nAlthough a diastolic murmur strongly suggests \naortic regurgitation, systolic murmurs may be \nthe on? ~urmur heard in patients with aortic \nregurg1tanon. \n3. Austin Flint murmur \na. Aonic regurgitant streams may impact the mitral valve \nleaflets during diastole resulting in functional mitral \nstenosis and a late diastolic murmur over the apex. \nb. Sensitivity varies from 0% to 100%. \nC. Echocardiography is the test of choice and should be per-\nformed in all patients with a diastolic murmur and in those \npatients with a dilated aortic root. \nD. Patients with biscuspid valves in whom the aortic root is not \nadequately visualized with transthoracic echocardiography \nshould undergo additional imaging to evaluate the aortic root \n(eg, transesophageal echocardiography or cardiac MR). \nE. Exercise testing can help assess LY function during stress. \nTreatment \nA. Valve replacement is indicated in symptomatic patients or \nthose with evidence ofLV decompensation (an ejection \nfraction S 50% or LY end-diastolic diameter > 65 mm or \nLY end-systolic diameter > SO mm). \nB. Valve replacement should not be delayed once signs of LY \ndysfunction develop. \n1. Medical therapy is of uncertain efficacy, and the prognosis \nis worse if symptoms or significant LY dysfunction are \npresent at the time of surgery. \n2. Symptoms, LY dysfunction, and death occur in 0%/y of \npatients with a LY end-systolic diameter of< 40 mm but \nincrease to 6%/y in those with a diameter of 40-SO mm \nand 19%/y in those with a diameter > SO mm. \n3. Mortality in symptomatic patients without surgery is \n10-20% per year. \nC. Serial echocardiography is important to detect signs of LY \ndysfunction, which may oc:c:ur in patients without symptoms. \nIt should be performed regularly with timing based on the \nseverity of regurgitation and whenever there is a change of \nsymptoms. \n\n286 I CHAPTER 15 \nD. Replacement valves may be either mec:hankal or bioprosthetk \n(eg, porcine valves). \n1. Mechanical valves \na. More durable and often chosen for young patients \nto minimize the need for subsequent aonic valve \nreplacement. \nb. Require lifdong anticoagulation with a VKA (target \nINR2.5-3) in addition to aspirin (75-100 mg/day) \n2. Bioprosthetic valves \na. Used more often in older patients (> 70 years) \nwith shoner life expectancies and patients at greater \nrisk for bleeding while receiving antkoagulation \ntherapy. \nb. Patients undergoing prosthetk valve replacement at \na lorisk for bleeding should receive a VKA (target \nINR 2.5) for 3--6 months following surgery followed \nby aspirin (75-100 mg/day) \n3. Endocarditis prophylaxis prior to dental procedures \nis recommended for patients following aonic valve \nreplacement with a mechanical or bioprosthetic \ndevice and for repairs using bioprosthetic material. \nIt is also recommended for patients with a history of \nendocarditis. \nE. When aonic regurgitation is secondary to dilatation of the \naonic root, valve repair is recommended in patients with \naonic regurgitation of any severity associated with an aonic \nroot> 4.5-5 cm. \nF. Afterload reduction with ACE inhibitors \n1. Should not be substituted for aonic valve replacement in \npatients with an indkation for valve replacement \n2. Indications \na. Severe aortic regurgitation \n(1) Symptomatic patients or those with LY dysfunction \nas shon-term preoperative therapy to improve their \nhemodynamic function. \n(2) Symptomatic patients or those with LY dysfunction \nwho are not surgical candidates \nb. Recommended for patients with any degree of aortic \nregurgitation and hypertension \n3. Not indicated in asymptomatic, normotensive patients \nwith normal systolic function and mild to moderate aonic \nregurgitation \nG. The role of beta-blockers in patients with chronic aonic \nregurgitation is uncenain. Beta-blockers prolong diastole, \nwhich may increase regurgitation and accelerate progression, \nbut data are conflicting. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Aortic Stenosis \nSee Chapter 31, Syncope. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation \nTextbook Presentation \nClassically, patients with atrial fibrillation seek medical care for \npalpitations. The abrupt onset often prompts patients to be seen \nemergently. Patients may also complain of shortness of breath and \ndyspnea on exenion. Occasionally, atrial fibrillation is detected \nduring a routine office visit when an irregularly irregular pulse is \ndiscovered and evaluated. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Atrial fibrillation is the most common clinical arrhythmia \naffecting up to 6.1 million in the United States with a \nlifetime risk of 37% after age 55 and increasing incidence \nwith age (3.8% of patients <!: 60 years old to 9% in those \n~ 80 years old). \nB. May be paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent \nC. Secondary to multiple wavelets of excitation that meander \naround the atria \nD. Etiologies \n1. Most common etiologies are hypertension, HF, and \nvalvular heart disease. \n2. Acute coronary syndrome: In 2-5% of patients presenting \nto the emergency department with new-onset atrial \nfibrillation, it is secondary to an acute ML \n3. Other etiologies include alcoholic heart disease, cor \npulmonale, thyrotoxicosis, and PE. \nE. Complications \n1. Stroke: Stasis promotes thrombus formation within the \natria, especially the left atrial appendage. Subsequent \nembolization results in stroke and other systemic emboli. \na. Atrial fibrillation accounts for one-sixth of all strokes. \nb. Stroke is more common in patients with atrial \nfibrillation who have other clinical risk factors: \n(1) Valvular heart disease \n(2) Prior transient ischemic attack or stroke \n(3) Increasing age \n(4) Hypenension \n(5) Diabetes \n(6) HF \n(7) Sex (women affected 1.5-3.0 times more than men) \nc. The annual stroke rate is 4.1 % per year in patients with \natrial fibrillation who are not receiving anticoagulation. \nHowever, the risk varies from 0.2% to 17% depending \non the presence or absence of these other risk factors. \nFor example, the annual stroke in the subgroup of \npatients with a prior transient ischemic attack or stroke \nis 13% per year. \n2. Worsening HF due to loss of atrial kick; especially \nimportant in patients with stiffLVs (ie, diastolic \ndysfunction from hypenension) \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Easily recognized on ECG by the presence of an irregular \nventricular rate and lack of normal organized atrial activity \n(p waves). Tiny atrial depolarizations (fibrillatory waves) are \noften seen (Figure 15-3). \nB. Episodic atrial fibrillation can be detected with extended \ncardiac monitoring (Holter monitoring, loop recorder, or \nevent monitor). \nTreatment \nA. Evaluation \n1. ECG can document atrial fibrillation as well as suggest \nunderlying etiologies (ischemia or right heart strain in PE.) \n2. Baseline echocardiogram to assess LY function and stroke \nrisk \n\nDYSPNEA I 287 \nFigure 15-3. ECG of atrial fibrillation demonstrating irregularly spaced QRS \ncorn plexes and fibril latory p waves. \n3. Thyroid function tests, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine. \n4. Consider evaluation for other etiologies {eg, MI, PE). \nB. Rhythm control versus rate control \n1. Cardioversion should be performed immediately in unstable \npatients (with ischemia, hypotension, or severe HF). \n2. In stable patients, 2 options exist: rhythm control or rate \ncontrol. \na. Rhythm control attempts to restore and maintain \nnormal sinus rhythm using cardioversion (electrical or \npharmacologic) and antiarrhythmic agents. \nb. Rate control allows persistent atrial fibrillation. The \nventricular response is controlled with atrioventricular \nnodal blocking agents (eg, beta-blockers, diltiazem, \nverapamil, or digoxin}. \nc. Srudies shothat rhythm control and rate control \nresult in similar mottality and stroke rates, even in \npatients with underlying HF. \nd. Stroke risk is the same in rhythm and rate control \nstrategies, as rhythm control does not obviate the risk of \nstroke. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) \nrecommends continuing long-term antithrombotic \ntherapy in patients managed with either a rate or rhythm \ncontrol strategy based on their risk factors regardless of the \nappearance of persistent normal sinus rhythm. \ne. Rate control is the recommended strategy in most patients, \nespecially ones with minimal symptoms. (Patients with \ntheir first episode of atrial fibrillation or with symptoms or \nexercise intolerance may choose rhythm control.) \n(I) A resting heart rate of< 110 bpm is recommended. \n(2) Uses beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium \nchannel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil}. Digoxin \nmay be appropriate in some patients. Amiodarone is \nalso effective in carefully selected patients. \n(3) Beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium \nchannel blockers should be avoided in patients with \ntkcompmsated HF. \n(4) Digoxin \n(a) Second-line drug, useful in patients with HFrEF \nor as a secondary additive therapy \n(b) Less effective at controlling ventricular response \nduring activity and in paroxysmal atrial \nfibrillation. \n(c) Should not be used as the sole agent for patients \nwith paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. \n(S) Combination therapy \n(a) Combinations that may be used to control heart \nrate include beta-blockers with diltiazem or \ndigoxin or diltiazem or verapamil with digoxin. \nOccasionally, 3 rate control agents will be \nneeded. \n(b) Verapamil and beta-blockers should not be \nused in combination due to a high frequency of \ncomplications (bradycardia or HF). \n(6) Atrioventricular node ablation with pacemaker \nplacement can be used to achieve rate control \nwhen pharmacologic therapy is unsuccessful or \nnot tolerated. \n(7) Amiodarone can be used for hean rate control if \nother measures fail. \n Rhythm control therapy \n(I) Cardioversion options \n(a) Flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, ibutilide, \namiodarone, or direct current cardioversion \ncan be used to restore normal sinus rhythm. \nAmiodarone may be best in patients with \nstructural heart disease. \n(b) Electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in \npatients with hypokalemia or digoxin toxicity. \n(2) The probability of conversion to normal sinus \nrhythm decreases the longer the duration of atrial \nfibrillation. \n(3) Anticoagulation therapy for cardioversion. \nAnticoagulation is used preceding and \nfollowing cardioversion (whether electrical or \nchemical) to decrease the risk that preexistent \nthrombi embolize or nethrombi form and \nembolize. \n(a) In unstable patients, cardioversion should not \nbe delayed. Systemic anticoagulation with \nN unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-\nweight heparin should be statted as soon as \npossible, followed by at least 4 weeks of full \nanticoagulation. \n(b) In stable patients, if the atrial fibrillation \nis < 48 hours in duration, patients may \nundergo cardioversion while concurrently \nreceiving systemic anticoagulation with N \nunfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight \n\n288 I CHAPTER 15 \nheparin, or direct-acting oral anticoagulants \n(DOACs), followed by at least 4 weeks of full \nanticoagulation. \n(c:) In stable patients in whom the duration of \natrial fibrillation is ~ 48 hours in duration \nor of unknown duration, anticoagulation for \n3 weeks prior to c:ardioversion is recommended. \nAlternatively; transesophageal ec:hoc:ardiography \nc:an be performed to look for intrac:ardiac \nthrombi. Patients without thrombi can receive \nunfractionated heparin and then undergo \nc:ardioversion. Patients with thrombi should \nreceive 3 weeks of anticoagulation therapy prior \nto c:ardioversion. All patients additionally receive \nan additional 4 weeks of anticoagulation after \nc:ardioversion. \n(d) Following completion of the 4 weeks of post-\nc:ardioversion anticoagulation, long-term \nanticoagulation decisions are based on the \nindividual patient risk profile. \n(4) The maintenance of sinus rhythm is complex and \nbeyond the scope of this text. Options include \npharmacologic therapy and surgical procedures \n(percutaneous or open). Cardiology consultation \nis recommended. \nC. Stroke prevention \n1. Antithrombotic therapy with anticoagulants, including \nvitamin K antagonists (warfarin) and the DOACs, and \nantiplatelet agents (typically aspirin) are used to prevent \nstrokes in atrial fibrillation patients. \n2. The choice of anticoagulation is based on patient-specific \ncharac:teristics, balancing the mitigation of stroke risk with \nthe increased risk of bleeding. \na. Stroke risk is best assessed using the CHApS2-VASc: \nscore (Table 15-13). Table 15-15 summarizes the 2019 \nAHA/ ACC/HRS anticoagulation guideline for patients \nwith atrial fibrillation. \nTable 15-13.

Although physicians worry about bleeding \ncomplications in the elderly, studies shothat elderly \npatients with atrial fibrillation are at high risk for \nstroke and benefit from anticoagulation if they are \ncarefully selected. \nc. Bleeding risk may be assessed using the HASBLED \nscore, although performance of the score is variable \n(Table 15-14). \n3. DOACs are norecommended as first-line therapy for \nanticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. \na. DOACs directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or factor \nXa (rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban). \nb. Compared with warfarin, dosing is easier, \nanticoagulation does not require monitoring, and \nthere are fewer drug and food interactions. \nc. DOACs vary in their metabolism, and adverse event \nprofiles and drug selection must be individualized to \npatient c:harac:teristics. \nd. Reversal of bleeding associated with DOACs requires \nuse of specific: monoc:lonal antibodies. Vitamin K, \nprothrombin complex concentrate, and fresh frozen \nplasma are generally ineffective. \n4. Warfarin remains a viable option to prevent stroke in atrial \nfibrillation \na. The standard INR target is 2.0-3.0. \nTable 15-14.

Both of these features should prompt a thorough \ninvestigation. Unfortunately, the clinical information does not \nsuggest any of the most c:ommon causes of dyspnea (HF, COPD, \nPE, or pneumonia) (Figure 15-1). Specifically, she has no risk \nfactors for HF (CAD, hypertension, or alcohol abuse), no history \nof wheezing, or significant smoking history to suggest asthma or \nCOPD, no fever or c:ough to suggest pneumonia, and no associ-\nated symptoms or risk factors to suggest PE (c:hest pain, can1:er, \nimmobilization, prior VTE). She also does not have c:hest pain that \ncan help limit the differential diagnosis. A careful exam is vital to \nlook for helpful clues. \n\nOn physlca l exam, the patient appears comfortable at rest \nbut becomes markedly dyspneic wrth ambulation. Vital \nsigns are BP. 140/70 mm Hg; pulse, 72 bpm; temperature, \n37.1C; RR. 20 breaths per minute. Conjunctiva are pink. \nLung exam Is clear to percussion and auscultation. There \nare no crackles or wheezes. Cardiac exam reveals a ~ular \nrate and rhythm. S1 and S 2 are normal. There Is no JVD, S15, \n5 4, or murmur. There is only trace peripheral edema. Audom-\ninal exam is normal. A chest radiograph, ECG, and CBC are \nnormal. \nDespite a thorough exam, the leading diagnosis is unclear as \nshe has none of the pivotal findings (S<\", JVD, egophony/bronc:hial \nbreath sounds, cracldes) (Figure 15-lJ. In suc:h cases, it is partic-\nularly important to systematically reviethe differential diagnosis \nin order to arrive at the correct diagnosis (Table 15-2). Eac:h item \non the list should be reviewed in light of the history and physi-\ncal to determine whether it remains in the differential and should \nbe explored further, or whether the existing information makes it \nhighly unlikely. \nReviewing Table 15-2, the absence of a murmur makes mitral \nregurgitation and aortic stenosis unlikely, since the clinical exam \nis 85-90% sensitive for these conditions. The clinical exam is less \nsensitive for aortic regurgitation. Therefore, aortic regurgitation \nremains on the differential diagnosis. An arrhythmia is essentially \nruled out by the patient's normal heart rate during symptoms. HF \nis not suggested by the history and physical exam, but it cannot be \nexcluded given the losensitivity of the S3 gallop and JVD. The \npatient denies any history of c:hest pain, but dyspnea is 01:1:asion-\nally an angina! equivalent, thus CAD also remains a possibility. \nPneumonia is highly unlikely given the normal chest film and \nthe lad of fever, cough, and cracldes. Asthma remains a possi-\nbility although this is not particularly suggested by the history or \nphysical exam. COPD is very unlikely given the modest smok-\ning history. PE 1:annot be excluded by the current information \nand remains on the list; although the presentation is not classic \nfor PE, the most important determinant of the likelihood of PE \nis the likelihood of other disorders on the differential diagnosis. \nIn this case, there are feconvincing alternatives, thus increasing \nthe likelihood of PE. Since PE is associated with a high mortal-\nity, it should also be considered a must not miss possibility. A \nsignificant pleural effusion and pneumothorax are ruled out by \nthe normal chest radiograph, which also makes interstitial dis-\nease unlikely (although not impossible). Anemia is ruled out by \nthe normal CBC. We can nofocus on the clinical clues and \ndiagnosti1: tests for these remaining possible diagnoses (aorti1: \nregurgitation, HF, CAD, asthma, and PE). Table 15-16 lists the \ndifferential diagnosis. \nTable 15-16.

Her last cholesterol \nlevel was normal [180 mg/dl] wit h an HDL of 70 mg/dL.) \nWith respect to asthma, she denies any history of wheez-\ning or worsening cough associated wit h cold, exercise. \npets, or dust. With respect to PE, she denies sudden \nonset of chest pain. chest pain with inspiration. hemop-\ntysls, Immobilization, cancer, SUl'!:Jery, family history of \nVTE, or leg swelling. She does take hormone replacement \ntherapy. \nAn echocardlogram reveals normal LV function and a \nnormal aortic valve. Pulmonary function tests reveal normal \ntotal lung capacit y, forced expiratory volume in 1 second \n(FEV1), and single-breath diffusing capacity (DLCO). A \nmethachol!ne challenge test is also normal. \n\nConsidering each diagnosis in turn, the patient's physical exam \nand echocardiogram exclude HF and aortic regurgitation. The \npatient's pretest probability of CAD is quite logiven her age, sex, \nand risk factors (3.2%; see Chapter 9, Chest Pain). In addition, the \nFramingham data suggest the likelihood of a coronary event in a \nfemale patient with these CAD risk factors to be just 2% over the \nensuing 10 years. The history and normal pulmonary function tests \nwith methacholine challenge make asthma very unlikely. Although \nher history, especially the extended presentation, sounds atypical \nfor PE, she is taking hormone replacement therapy, a known risk \nfactor for VfE. Given the exclusion of the other diagnoses, PE \nbecomes more probable. You revise your differential diagnosis and \nmake PE both your leading and must not miss diagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: PE \nTatbook Presentation \nClassically, patients with PE experience the sudden onset of short-\nness of breath and severe chest pain that increases with inspiration. \nPatients may complain of hemoptysis and associated unilateral leg \nswdling. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Pathophysiology \n1. Most commonly occurs when a lower extremity venous \nthrombus embolizes to the lung \n2. Thrombi in the upper extremity, often associated with \nvascular catheters, and pdvic veins may also cause PE. \n3. 80% of patients with PE have deep venous thrombosis \n(DVI'). \n4. 48% of patients with DVf have PE (often asymptomatic). \nB. Symptoms vary markedly. \n1. Massive obstruction may result in RV failure and death \n2. However, lesser obstruction may be asymptomatic. \nC. Mortality \n1. 3-month mortality is 17.5% \n2. When left untreated, mortality rate approaches 30% \n3. With appropriate treatment, mortality rates drop to as \nlowas2% \nD. Risk factors \n1. A variety of risk factors increase the likdihood for VfE, \nincluding a personal history ofVfE, estrogen use, surgery \nwithin the last 4 weeks, personal history of thrombophilia, \nactive malignancy, immobilization, and age over 50. \n2. Thrombophilia (presence of more than 1 thrombophilia \nmay greatly increase risk) \na. Antiphospholipid antibodies: Present in 2-8.5% of \npatients with VfE \nb. Factor V Leiden \n(1) Mutation in factor V causes resistance to cleavage by \nactivated protein C \n(2) Most common thrombophilia, but < 5% lifetime \nrisk ofVfE in heterozygotes \n(3) Present in 11 % of patients with DVf \nDYSPNEA I 291 \n(4) Heterozygote OR for VfE 4.2, homozygote OR 11.5 \n(5) Combined with oral birth control pill, mutation \nincreases risk 35 times \nc. Prothrombin gene mutation \n(1) Heterozygote OR for VfE 2.8 \n(2) Homozygote OR for VfE 6.7 \nd. Protein C or S deficiency (rare) \n(1) Protein C and Sare naturally occurring \nanticoagulants whose synthesis by the liver requires \nvitamin K \n(2) Deficiency is associated with hypc:rcoagulability. \n(3) Warfarin decreases synthesis of both factors. \n(4) Assays for protein C and S must be performed while \npatients are not taking warfarin and when acute \nthrombosis is not present. \ne. Antithrombin III deficiency (also rare): Assay must be \ndone while patient is not taking heparin. \n Hyperhomocysteinemia: 3 x increased risk ofVfE \ng. Increased factor VIII: 6 x increased risk \nE. PE may be an overlooked cause of \"COPD exacerbation\" \n1. One interesting study reported that 16% of patients with a \nCOPD exacerbation have PE. \n2. The rate was 25% among patients with an unexplained \nexacerbation ofCOPD, compared with 8% in those with \nan exacerbation of known etiology. \n3. Unexplained exacerbation was defined as patients without \nparenchymal consolidation on chest radiograph without \nfever or chills (ie, not obviously due to pneumonia) and \npatients who lacked the common factors precipitating \nCOPD exacerbations: \na. Lower respiratory tract infection (increased sputUm, \npurulence, fever, cold, or sore throat) \nb. Exposure to noxious irritants \nc. Objective signs of HF \nd. Medication nonadherence \n~ \nConsider PE in patients with a COPD exacer-\ny \nbation that is unexplained. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis of PE \nA. Clinical presentation: The diagnosis of PE is complicated \nbecause patients present in a variety of ways and signs and \nsymptoms are neither sensitive nor specific. \n1. Although dyspnea and chest pain are the most common \nsymptoms, neither is sufficiently sensitive to rule out the \ndiagnosis when absent nor sufficiently specific to rule in \nPE when present. \n2. No other signs or symptoms are sufficiently sensitive nor \nspecific to rule in or out PE (Table 15-17); LR+, 0.3-2; \nLR-, 0.8-1.2. \nThe classic presentation of PE is actually the \nexception. Patients may have very fesymp-\ntoms. A high index of suspicion must be \nmaintained for the diagnosis of PE. The most \nimportant consideration is whether an alter \nnate diagnosis is an adequate explanation for \nthe patient presentation. \n\n292 I CHAPTER 15 \nTable 15-17.

Twave inversions in Vl-V4 when seen in conjunction \nwith T wave inversions in lead III strongly suggests PE \n(Sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 99%; LR+ 88; LR- 0.12). \nC. D-dimers \n1. D-dimers are fibrin breakdown products that are often \nelevated in patients with VTE but are nonspecific; may \nbe elevated in many other conditions, including surgery, \ntrauma, cancer, and end-stage renal disease. \n2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and \nquantitative rapid ELISA are more sensitive than other \nassays (95-98%; LR-, 0.05-0.11). Current algorithms \nrequire the use of a high sensitivity quantitative D-dimer. \n3. LoD-dimer levels are used to rule out PE. It is important \nto emphasize that they need to be used in conjunction with \ndecision rules, since a loD-dimer level is not sufficiently \nsensitive to rule out PE in patients with a high pretest \nprobability of PE. \n,..., LoD-dimer levels do not rule out PE in \ny \npatients with a high pretest probability of PE. \n4. Due to the poor specificity of D-dimer assays, high levels \ndo not confirm PE, but rather necessitate further testing \n(eg, CTA). \nD. CTA \n1.

A wide range of sensitivities and specificities have been \npublished due to variations in CT methodology (single \nvs multidetcctor), standard for diagnosis, duration of \nfollow-up and differing patient populations (sensitivity, \n83-90%; specificity, 94-100%). \nb. Follow-up studies of patients with negative CTA have \ndocumented subsequent VTE in 1.3-8%. A recent \nmeta-analysis showed a rate of PE of 8% when the \nclinical probability of disease was > 40%. \nc. The PIOPED II study reported on the accuracy of \nmultidetector CT using stringent diagnostic criteria. \n(l) Multidetector CTA was 83% sensitive and 96% \nspecific for PE (LR+ 19.6; LR-, 0.18). \n(2) The negative predictive value was 96% in low-risk \npatients {Wells score < 2), 89% in intermediate-risk \npatients {Wdls score 2-6) and only 60% in high-\nrisk patients (Wells score > 6). \nE. Ventilation~perfusion cV/QJ scan \n1. Radionuclear study used less frequently since advent \nofCTA \n2. Radio-isotopes infused and inhaled. V/Q images are \ncompared yidding the following potential results: \na. High probability scan \n(l) Multiple areas of no perfusion but normal \nventilation \n(2) Effectively rules in PE, especially in patients with \nmoderate or high likdihood of PE \n(a) Sensitivity, 60%; specificity 96% \n(b) LR+ 15; LR- 0.4 \n(c) The positive predictive value drops to 56% in \nsetting ofloclinical probability \nb. Normal or near normal perfusion scan effectively rules out \nPE. (Normal scans are seen in 0-2% of patients with PE.) \nc. Nondiagnostic scan (loor intermediate probability) \n(1) Matched areas of ventilation and perfusion \nabnormalities \n\n(2) 67% of patients who undergo V/Q testing have this \npattern \n(3) Likelihood of PE ranges from 4% to 66%, depending \non clinical probability; neither rules in or out PE \n3. Given high rate of nondiagnostic results, V/Q scan is \ntypically reserved for patients who need CTA but who have \na contraindication to contrast dye. \nF. Angiography \n1. Considered the gold standard but actual test characteristics \nunknown. There is a very lorisk of recurrent PE if negative. \n2. Invasive and rarely used; serious complications occur in \n0-3% of patients. \nG. Decision rules \n1. Due to the wide range of possible presentations and \npotential life-threatening nature of PE, a large number of \npatients are evaluated for PE (appropriately), which is only \nidentified in a minority (~ 20%). \n2. Decision rules have been developed that can objectively \ndetermine the patients pretest probability of disease and \ndetermine whether patients require no further testing, \nD-dimer testing, or CTA. \na. PERC rule \n(1) Unlike the Wells and Geneva scores, the PERC rule \nis a clinical decision rule designed to use clinical \ncriteria to rule out PE in patients with a lopretest \nprobability of PE and thereby obviate the need for \nother objective testing (D-dimer or CTA). \n(2) Patients with none of the following are classified as \nPERC-negative: \n(a) Age ~ 50 years \n(b) Heart rate ~ 100 bpm \n(c) Sa01 s 94% on room air \n(d) Prior history ofVfE, trauma, or surgery in the \nlast 4weeks \n(e) Hemoptysis \n(f) Exogenous estrogen \n(g) Unilateral leg swelling \n(3) Meta-analysis of 12 studies and over 14,000 patients \nrevealed a LR- of0.17 in PERC-negative patients \nin patients with a lopretest probability of disease. \nAnalysis restricted to studies that used stringent \ndiagnostic criteria to rule out a PE revealed that the \nsensitivity of the PERC rule (all findings negative) \nwas good but not perfect (96%). \n(4) Can only be used in in patients with a loclinical \nprobability for PE (by Wells or Geneva scores). \nb. Wells and Geneva rules \n(1) Developed to estimate the pretest probability of PE \nonce the decision has been made to test the patient \nfur possible PE. \n(2) Not sufficiently accurate to rule PE in or out \nwithout additional testing (CTA or D-dimer) \n(LR+ 1.4-3; LR-, 0.24-0.5). \n(3) Used to risk stratify patients and determine whether \npatients should subsequently undergo CTA or \nsimply have a D-dimer level measured. \n(4) Scoring: \n(a) Clinical signs and symptoms of DVf: 3 points, \nPE is as likely or more likely than alternative \ndiagnoses: 3 points \nDYSPNEA I 293 \n(b) Heart rate > 100 bpm: 1.5 points \n(c) Immobilization ~ 3 days or recent surgery \n{< 4 weeks): 1.5 points \n(d) Prior VfE (DVf or PE): 1.5 points \n(e) Hemoptysis: 1 point \n(f) Active cancer (treated in last 6 months or \npalliative): 1 point \n(S) The total score can be used to estimate the patients \npretest probability and identify the optimal testing \nstrategy (Figure 154). \nH. Strategy \n1. Use the Wells score to estimate the patients' probability of \ndisease; it can be used to stratify patients into 3 categories: \na. 0-1 point is loprobability \nb. 2-6 points is moderate probability \nc. > :<!: 7 points is high probability \n2. The combination of a loprobability of PE (by Wells \nscore) and either a PERC score of 0 or a negative high-\nsensitivity D-dimer effectively rules out PE (Figure 154). \n3. The combination of a moderate probability of PE (Wells \nscore) and a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer effectively \nrules out PE. A negative quantitative D-dimer assay in a \npatient with a Wells score of s 4 has a failure rate (missed \ndiagnoses) of 0.5%. \n4. All other patients, including patients with a high \nprobability of PE (Wells score ~ 7) or a positive high-\nsensitivity D-dimer, should undergo CTA unless \ncontraindicated. \na. Positive CTA: effectively confirms the diagnosis of PE \nb. Negative CTA \n(1) Effectively rules out PE in low- to moderate-risk \npatients \n(2) Additional testing should be considered in high-risk \npatients (Wells ~ 7). \n(3) Options fur additional testing include duplex \nleg ultrasonographfi i~direct CT of the leg veins \n(CT venography), V/Qscanning, and pulmonary \nangiography. \n(a) Since a diagnosis of DVf is taken as a \nsurrogate marker for the diagnosis of PE, \nduplex leg ultrasonography is the most \ncommonly used test in this situation. In \npatients with adequate pulmonary reserve, \nserial negative ultrasounds may safely exclude \nthe diagnosis of PE and obviate the need fur \nfurther testing \n(b) Another alternative to rule out DVf is \nCT venography, which can be performed \nat the same time as CTA However, some \nstudies suggest that it is less sensitive than leg \nultrasound (sensitivity, 60-100%; specificity, \n93-100%). \n(c) A combined strategy ofCTA and duplex leg \nultrasonography has an excellent negative \npredictive value ( .. 100%) and is advisable for \npatients with a high likelihood of PE. \n5. In patients with ~~te or chronic kidney disease or \ncontrast allergy, V/Q scanning can be considered in \nplace of CTA. \n6. Pulmonary angiography is rarely used. \n7. The approach is illustrated in Figure 15-4. \n\n294 I CHAPTER 15 \nPossible PE \nDetermine clinical probability of PE \n{clinical gestalt or Wells score) \nLoprobability of PE \n(Wells score 0-1) \nModerate probability of PE \n(Wells score H) \nHigh probability of PE \n(Wells score :i: 7) \nPERC or D-dimer \nPE ruled out \nPE ruled out \n1 or higher >--___,_ \nD-dimer \nPE ruled out \nPositive \nNegative \nStop (unless \nvery high \nclinical \nprobability of \nPE, then \nconsider \nfurther \ntesting) \nPositive \nTreat for PE \n111 contraindication to CTPA, consider V/Q scan.

Approach to diagnostic testing in patients with suspected pulmonary emboli. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis of DVI' \nA. Given the overlap o{PE and DVf (and the same therapy}, the \ndiagnosis ofDVf is often taken as evidence of concomitant PE. \nB. Several clinical features modestly increase the likelihood of \nDVf, including \n1. Malignancy (LR+ 2.7) \n2. Prior DVf (LR+ 2.3) \n3. Immobilization (LR+ 2.0) \n4. Recent surgery (LR+ 1.8) \n5. Difference in calf diameter (LR+ 1.8) \nC. Signs and symptoms are less helpful at ruling out DVf out, \nincluding no difference in calf diameter (LR-, 0.67); lack of \ncalf pain (LR-, 0.9); and no Homan sign (LR-, 0.87). \nThe clinical exam for DVf is insensitive. \nClinicians must have a lothreshold for \nordering D-dimer or duplex studies. \nD. The diagnostic strategy for DVf integrates the pretest prob-\nability of DVf with diagnostic tests of appropriate sensitivity \nto achieve a satisfactory negative predictive value. In short, as \nthe probability of DVf increases, more sensitive testing strate-\ngies need to be used to rule out DVf. \n1. The Wells score can help predict risk ofDVf. \na. Patients are assigned 1 point for each of the following: \n(1) Active cancer \n(2) Immobilization of the lower extremity \n(3) Recently bedridden (~ 3 days) \n\n(4) Surgery requiring general anesthesia within the last \n12 weeks \n(5) Tenderness along the deep venous system \n(6) Swelling of the entire leg \n(7) Calf swelling ~ 3 cm larger than the unaffected leg \n(8) Pitting edema of the symptomatic leg \n(9) Collateral superficial veins \n(10) Prior DVf \nb. 2 points arc subtracted if an alternative diagnosis is at \nleast as likely as a DVf. \nc. The prevalence of DVf is 5% for patients with \nloprobability score (~ 0), 17% for patients with a \nmoderate probability score (1-2), and 53% for patients \nwith a high probability score (~ 3). \n2. Diagnostic tests \na. D-dimer \n(1) D-dimers are very sensitive for VfE but not \nspecific. \n(a) Sensitivity, 88-92%; specificity, 45-72% \n(b) LR- for high sensitivity assay < 0.1 \n(2) In patients with a loclinical probability, the negative \npredictive value of a negative D-dimer is 99%. \n(3) D-dimer never confirms DVf. When elevated, \nultrasonography is indicated. \nb. Duplex ultrasonography \n(1) Ultrasonography may visualize the whole leg or be \nlimited to the proximal leg. \n(a) Proximal ultrasonography can rule out proximal \nDVf but will not detect distal DVf (that rarely \nembolize but can extend and then embolize). \nAssess clinical probability \nof DVT (Wells score) \nPrior DVT \nNo prior DVT \nScore ~O \nScore 1-2 \nModerate probability \n~-'-~ (-\nClinical follow-up \n(-) \nHighly sensitive D-dlmer \n(+) \n(-) \nD-dimer (+) \nProxi'nal vein U/S (+) Treat VTE \n(+) \nProximal or whole leg U/S \nDYSPNEA I 295 \n(b) Sensitivity and specificity for symptomatic \nproximal DVf is 89-96% and 94-99%, \nrespectively; LR+, 24; LR-, 0.05 \n(c) Even whole leg ultrasound is less sensitive \nfor distal (belothe knee} DVf, 73-93% \nc. Other options include venography (invasive) and \nmagnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging \n(accurate but costly). \n3. Diagnostic strategy \na. In short, DVf is ruled in by a positive ultrasound. \nb. DVf may be ruled out in the following situations: \n(1) Loprobability Wells score: Negative D-dimer test \n(2) Moderate probability Wells score: Negative highly-\nsensitive D-dimer test \n(3) High probability Wells score: Negative whole leg \nultrasound or negative proximal leg ultrasound and \nnegative D-dimer \n(4) In moderate and high probability patients with \na negative proximal leg ultrasound and a positive \nD-dimer, repeat ultrasound is recommended \n(to ensure that a nonvisualized distal DVf has not \nextended). \nc. Figure 15-5 illustrates the testing strategy recommended \nby the ACCP for evaluating patients for their first DVf. \nTreatment \nA. Oxygen should be administered to patients with hypoxemia. \nB.

If thrombolysis is contraindicated in a patient for whom \nit would otherwise be recommended, catheter-directed \ntherapy or embolectomy is recommended. \nD. Anticoagulation: Overvie\n1. Any of the options for anticoagulation described in Atrial \nFibrillation, Stroke prevention (see above) are effective. \n2. Research is ongoing to determine optimal therapy and the \nchoice of anticoagulants is evolving rapidly. The DOACs \nhave recently replaced heparin and warfarin as the preferred \ntreatments. \nE. 2016 ACCP Clinical Practice Guidelines for treatment of \nproximal DVT or PE \n1. Initiation of anticoagulation \na. Initial treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor or \nfactor Xa inhibitor; dabigatran and edoxaban were \nonly studied after initial treatment with heparin, thus \nrivaroxaban and apixaban may be preferred since they \ndo not require a heparin \"lead-in.\" \nb. Low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux \nfollowed by vitamin K antagonist (target INR 2.0-3.0) \nare less preferable options. \nc. If vitamin K antagonist therapy is chosen, overlap \nanticoagulation with heparin should be continued for \na minimum of 5 days and until the INR is > 2.0 for \n~ 24 hours. \nd. DVf/PE associated with active cancer: low-molecular-\nweighc heparin is recommended over vitamin K \nantagonist. A recent trial suggests edoxaban is a \nreasonable alternative to low-molecular-weight heparin \n(lower rate ofVfE at expense of more bleeding). \n2. Duration of anticoagulation \na. Modified by the bleeding risk and inciting cause of the \nDVTorPE. \nb. Anticoagulation is effective during therapy. After \ndiscontinuation, patients with persistent risk factors or \nidiopathic VfE are at increased risk for recurrence. \nc. Recommendation \n(1) Surgery provoked: 3 months. \n(2) Nonsurgical transient risk factor: 3 months \n(3) Unprovoked: \n(a) Patient at substantial risk for bleeding: 3 months \n(b) Patient at loto moderate risk for bleeding: \nExtended therapy (no scheduled stop date) \n(4) Recurrent DVf/PE: Extended therapy unless the \npatient is at high risk for bleeding. \n(5) DVf /PE associated with active cancer: Extended \ntherapy is recommended. \n3. DVT /PE in patients with a contraindication to \nanticoagulation or in whom anticoagulation therapy has \nfailed: inferior vena cava filter is recommended. \n4. Isolated distal DVf (belothe knee) \na. Initiate anticoagulation (3 months) if patient has severe \nsymptoms or risk factors for extension (active cancer, \nrecent surgery or transient risk factor), prior VfE, \ninpatient status, extensive thrombosis. \nb. In other patients, anticoagulation may be held with \nrepeat imaging in 2 weeks to rule out extension. Patients \nwith extension should be given an anticoagulant (even if \nthe clot is still distal). \nF. Work-up for thrombophilia: Guidelines for routine testing \nhave not been determined. Consider tests for thrombophilic \nstates in patients without clear precipitant of VfE. \nG. Primary prevention ofVfE \n1. 25% of venous thromboembolic events are associated \nwith hospitalization. At particularly high risk are patients \nundergoing hip fracture surgery, hip or knee replacement, \nand those with spinal cord injury. \n2. Hospitalized medical patients account for 50-75% of \nhospital-associated VfE. \na. Anticoagulation prophylaxis has been demonstrated to \nreduce fatal and nonfatal VfE. \nb. At particularly high risk include patients who are \nolder than 40 years, who are hospitalized for ~ 3 days \nwith limited mobility, and who have ~ 1 of the \nfollowing: \n(1) Acute infectious disease \n(2) Class III or IV HF \n(3) Acute MI \n(4) Cerebrovascular accident \n(5) Active cancer \n(6) Acute respiratory disease \n(7) Rheumatic disease \n(8) Body mass index > 30 \n(9) Recent surgery or trauma \n(10) Thrombophilla \n(11) Prior VfE \n3. The intensity of the prophylaxis depends on the specific \nclinical situation. Options include compression stockings, \npneumatic compression devices (particularly useful in \npatients who have active bleeding or are at high risk), and \nanticoagulation. The ACCP updates guidelines frequently. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nYou reviethe patient's Wells score and assign her 3 points since \nPE is the most likely diagnosis. She also takes hormone replace-\nment therapy, which is a risk factor for PE. Because this reflects \na moderate probability of disease, you obtain a high-sensitivity \nD-dimer assay. The D-dimer is positive and you pursue CTA. \n\nThe CTA reveals mult iple small pulmonary emboli. \nHavs you c::roessd a diagnostic; threshold for \nthe Isadlng hYPoths&le, PE7 Havs you rulsd \nout ths actlvs altsmatlvss7 Do othsr tsst.5 \nnssd to be dons to sxc;lude the altsmatlve \ndiagnoses7 \nThe CTA is highly specific for PE, especially in the setting of \na moderate or high clinical probability of PE. At this point, PE is \nruled in and further confirmation is unnecessary. There is no need \nfor further testing to exclude alternative diagnoses. \n\nAlternative Diagnosis: Asthma \nSee Chapter 33, Wheezing and Stridor. \nAlternative Diagnosis: CAD \nSee Chapter 9, Chest Pain. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. L's hormone replacement therapy Is stopped and \nshe is given rivaroxaban.

Most patients \nwith dysuria have a urinary tract infection (UTI). When consid-\nering this symptom, pivotal points are history and physical exam \nfindings that suggest more serious or complicated etiologies. \nlmponant historical features include vaginal or penile discharge, \nflank pain, rectal/perineal pain, nausea or vomiting, fever, hema-\nturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary urgency, nocturia, and urinary fre-\nquency. On the physical exam, vital signs including temperature \nand sometimes orthostatics are important as are abdominal and \ncostovenebral-angle (CVA) tenderness. Except in a fesituations, \na pdvic exam should be performed in any woman with a vaginal \ndischarge. A prostate aam should be performed in any man in \nwhom cystitis is suspected, especially those with symptoms of noc-\nturia, hesitancy, or rectal pain. When approaching the differential \ndiagnosis for dysuria, an anatomic approach is hdpful for organi-\nzation. Bdois a list of diagnoses, organized by anatomic location, \nthat can cause dysuria. Many of these diagnoses (eg, bladder cancer \nand benign prostatic hypenrophy [BPH]) usually present with \nsymptoms other than dysuria. \nA. Skin: rash causing irritation with urination \n1.

The pivotal points in this case are the absence of flank pain, \nvaginal discharge, nausea, vomiting, or fever. Vaginitis is a com-\nmon disease that can cause similar symptoms, and pyelonephritis \nis a must not miss diagnosis. These diagnoses must be explored as \npart of the limited differential diagnosis (Table 16-1). \n\nPhyslcal exam demonstrates normal vital signs, normal \ntemperature, and absence of abdominal or CVA tendemess. \n~ \nle the cllnlc;al Information eufflclent to make a \n1~1'\" diagnosis? If not, what othsr Information do \nyou need1 \nLeading Hypothesis: Cystitis \nTextbook Presentation \nCystitis typically presents with dysuria or suprapubic pain or both. \nOften, there is associated urinary frequency, urgency, or hematuria. \nThere is usually no penile or vaginal discharge, CVA tenderness, \nnausea, vomiting, or fever. \nDisease Higblighu \nA. Cystitis is an infection of the bladder. \nB. Most common bacterial pathogens include enteric flora such as: \n1. Gram negatives: Eschmchia co/i (75-95%), KlebsieOa \npneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis \n2. Gram positives: Staphylococcus saprophyticu.s, Enterococcu.s \nfoeca/is, and group B streptococcus \nC. Risk factors for cystitis \n1. Sexual intercourse \n2. Use of spermicides \n3. Previous UTI \n4. A nesexual partner in the past year \nD. Cystitis in the elderly \n1. Elderly patients often have atypical presentations of cystitis. \n2. Deliriwn, functional decline, or acute confusion may be \nthe presenting symptoms of cystitis in elderly patients. \nCystitis frequently presents in atypical ways in \nthe elderly. UTis should be on the differential \nfor deliriwn or functional decline. \n3. As a further complication, many elderly patients have chronic \nsymptoms of frequency and incontinence not caused by \ncystitis. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA History \n1. Dysuria or suprapubic pain with or without frequency, \nhematuria, or urgency. \n2. The symptoms of vaginal discharge (LR- 0.3) or vaginal \nirritation (LR- 0.2) decrease the probability of cystitis in a \nwoman. \n3. If a woman has dysuria and frequency but without vaginal \ndischarge or irritation, she has a 90% likelihood of having \ncystitis. \nB. Laboratory testing \n1. Women with classic uncomplicated cystitis (dysuria with or \nwithout frequency and without vaginal discharge) may be \ntreated without any testing. \n2. Urinalysis or urine dipstick findings suggestive of cystitis \na. Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme released by leukocytes \nand signifies pyuria. LR+ 12.3-48 \nb. The presence of nitrites indicates the presence of \nbacteria that convert urinary nitrates to nitrites. \nc. White blood cdls on urine microscopy (> 5 per high \npowered field) \nd. Hematuria demonstrated by positive blood on dipstick \nor red blood cells (RBCs) on microscopy \nc. Table 16-2 shows the sensitivity, specificity, and \nlikelihood ratios of urinalysis and microscopy findings. \nf. The negative likelihood ratio of leukocyte esterase and \nurine nitrite is only 0.3; the absence of these findings \ndoes not rule out cystitis. \nTable 16-2. Test characteristics of urinalysis and microscopy. \nTest Finding \nLeukocyte esterase \nNitrite \n--------- \nLeukocyte esterase \nornitrite \nWhite blood cells \n(>5 per high \npowered field) \nSensitivity Specifidty \n74-9696 \n94-9896 \n45~096 \n85-9896 \n8296 \n72-9596 \n48-8296 \nLR+ \nLR-\n12.3-48 \n0.04-0.3 \n3-30 \n0.4-0.6 \n4.2 \n0.3 \n1.4-5.6 \n0.06-0.6 \n\nThe diagnosis of cystitis should not be ruled \nout by a urinalysis that is negative for both \nleukocyte esterase and nitrites in the presence \nof a convincing clinical presentation. \n3. Urine culture \na. Used as a confirmatory test in the setting of diagnostic \nuncertainty or the need to identify a specific bacterial \npathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility (such as in the \nsetting of recurrent cystitis). \nA urine culture is unnecessary in a patient with \nuncomplicated cystitis and no history of recur-\nrent infections or recent treatment failure. \nb. Urine culture should be performed if antimicrobial-\nresistance is suspected or when cystitis is suspected in men. \nc. The definition of a positive urine culture is > I 05 \ncolony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria per milliliter. \nd. Women with clinical symptoms of cystitis and lower \nconcentrations of bacteria may still have cystitis. \n(1) 30-50% of women with cystitis have CFU counts \nof 102 to 104 \n(2) In woman with dysuria, 101 or102 CFU E coli has a \npositive predictive value of92-93%. \nTreatment \nA. Prevention \nSymptomatic premenopausal women should be \ntreated despite negative midstream urine cultures. \n1. Factors that have not been found to be associated with cystitis \na. Precoital or postcoital voiding patterns \nb. Tampon use \nc. Douching \nd. Hot tub use \ne. Underwear type \n Body mass index \ng. Wiping patterns \n2. There are no data supporting that changing the above factors \nprevents recurrent cystitis. \nB. Antibiotics \n1. Antibiotic choice is empiric, covering enteric organisms. \n2. First-line options include nitrofurantoin, fosfumycin, and \ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). \n3. Other options include ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, \namoxicillin-clavulanate, and other beta-lactams. \n4. There is increasing resistance of E coli to TMP-SMX and \nfluoroquinolones. Once resistance in a treatment region \nexceeds 20% that antibiotic is no longer recommended. \nC. Treatment duration \n1. Uncomplicated cystitis \na. Defined as cystitis in healthy women with no urinary \ntract abnormalities. \nb. Antibiotics for 1-5 days is effective and recommended. \n2. Complicated cystitis \na. Defined as cystitis occurring in \n(1) Pregnant women \nDYSURIA I 301 \n(2) Men \n(3) Patients with urinary tract abnormalities (such as \nobstruction, neurogenic bladder, kidney stones) or \nan indwelling urinary catheter \n(4) Patients with immunosuppression or chronic kidney \ndisease \nb. Longer duration of antibiotics (7-14 days) is \nrecommended. \nc. In patients with complicated cystitis and previous or \nrecurrent cystitis, it is helpful to revieold cultures fur \nprevious resistance patterns when choosing empiric therapy. \n3. Diabetic women may be treated as having uncomplicated \nor complicated cystitis, and this should be determined \nbased on clinical judgement and other clinical features. \nD. Work-up for secondary causes \n1. Imaging (pre- and post-contrast CT) should be considered \nin women with multiple episodes of cystitis with the same \npathogen. \n2. Patients with hematuria during cystitis should have a \nurinalysis after resolution of the infection to determine \nwhether hematuria, requiring evaluation, persists. \n3. Men without a clear predisposition fur cystitis \n(ie, indwdling urinary catheter, known BPH) should be \nundergo evaluation. \nE. Recurrent cystitis \n1. If symptoms continue or return within 2 weeks after \ntreatment fur cystitis, relapse or antimicrobial resistance \nis likely. A different antibiotic should be used, and a urine \nculture should be perfurmed. \n2. If cystitis recurs beyond 1 month after successful treatment, \nthen standard treatment may be used. \n3. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (continuous or postcoital) may \nreduce the risk of recurrence by 95% for women with 3 or \nmore infections in 12 months. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nA clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated cystit is Is made. Urine \nc:lipsticl< is positive for leukocyte esterase only. \nHave you c::ro95Bd 11 diagnostic thrHhold \nfor the leading hypothesis, uncomplic::ated \nc::yetitis1 Have you ruled out the active \naltemativee1 Do other teete need to be done \nto exclude the alternative dlagnoH&1 \nThe results of the urine dipstick flt with the diagnosis of uncompli-\ncated cystitis. The patient has neither discharge to suggest vaginitis \nnor flank pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting to suggest pyelonephritis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Vaginitis \nTatbook Presentation \nVaginitis typically presents with abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, \nirritation, itching, dysuria, or dyspareunia. \nOisea5e Highlights \nA. Common infectious causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, \ntrichomoniasis, and candidiasis. \n\n302 I CHAPTER 16 \nB. Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the normal flora of the vagina \nis replaced with anaerobic bacteria most commonly, Gardn~-\n1/a vagina/is. \nC. Trichomoniasis is an STI caused by the flagellated protozoan, \nTrichomorzas vagina/is. It can also infect men, causing urethritis \nor silent infection. \nD. Vulvovaginal candidiasis \n1. Caused by various Candida species \n2. Often occurs with changes in the vaginal environment such \nas high cstrogen states (menses, pregnancy), antibiotic use, \nimmunosuppression, or poorly controlled diabetes. \nE. Atrophic vaginitis \n1. Caused by cstrogen deficiency (most often postmcnopausal) \nand results in thin, dry vaginal mucosa \n2. Can be symptomatic (dryness, burning, irritation, \ndysparcunia) and may increase the risk of recurrent cystitis \nF. Cervical infections often present with vaginal discharge. These \ninfections are discussed later in the chapter. \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Available tests \n1. The primary diagnostic test for vaginitis is examination of \nthe discharge. The test characteristics for many of the tests \narc discussed in Table 16-3. \n2. pH testing is done of discharge from the vaginal \nsidewall. \n3. Saline wet mount viewed at high and lopower \nthrough a microscope looking for clue cells, candida, or \ntrichomonads. \n4. The whiff test (performed by adding 10% potassium \nhydroxide (KOH) to the discharge and sniffing the sample \nfor a fishy amine odor). A positive test suggests bacterial \nvaginosis. \n5. A KOH wet mount should be performed to look for \nevidence of candidiasis. \n6. A trichomoniasis nucleic acid ampl.iflcation test (NAAT} \nshould be sent from a vaginal, endoccrvical, or urine \nspecimen, if available. \n7. Rapid point of care tests (antigen test or DNA \nhybridization probe) can be used if wet mount is not \navailable or possible, is not diagnostic, or if the NAAT is \nnot available. \nB. Bacterial vaginosis \n1. Presents with malodorous (typically fishy) white or gray \ndischarge without pain or itching. \n2. Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed by the Arnsel criteria (see \nTable 16-3). \n3. Rapid point of care tests can also be used if wet mount is \nnot diagnostic or not available. \nTable 16-3.

Trichomoniasis \n1. Suggested by the presence of a thin yelloor green frothy \ndischarge, irritation, dysuria, and dysparcunia but may also \nbe asymptomatic \n2. On physical exam, punctate hcmorrhagcs may be present \non the cervix (strawberry cervix) or vaginal walls. \n3. Diagnosis is usually made by seeing motile trichomonads \non saline wet mount. \n4. Greater prevalence of leukocytes than epithelial cells on wet \nmount suggests trichomoniasis. \nS. The whiff test may be positive with trichomoniasis. \n6. The ttichomoniasis NAAT is more sensitive and specific \nthan wet mount. It may be performed on vaginal, \ncndocervical, or urine specimens. \n7. Rapid point of care tests to detect trichomoniasis in vaginal \nsecretions are also available but with lower sensitivity. \nD. Vulvovaginal candidiasis \n1. Presents with itching, irritation, dysuria, dyspareunia and \nthick white \"curd-like\" discharge without odor. Lack of \nitching argues against the disease. \n2. Women's self-diagnosis is usually accurate. Clinicians whose \npatients report \"I have another yeast infection\" can usually \nrely that it is an accurate diagnosis. \n3. On exam, inflammation of the vulva and lack of odor \nincreases the likelihood of candidiasis. A thick, curdy, white \ndischarge argues fur candidiasis while a watery discharge \nargues against it. \n4. The presence of budding yeast or branching mycelia on \nKOH preparation of discharge is highly suggestive. \nE. Atrophic vaginitis \n1. Dryness is the most common symptom. \n2. Other symptoms include pruritus, irritation, discharge, \ndysuria, and dyspareunia. \n3. On exam, vaginal mucosa is thin and dry, and \ninflammation may be present. \n4. Diagnosis is clinical and includes a lack of findings \nsuggestive of infection. \nF. Inconclusive evaluation \n1. About 30% of women with vaginal complaints do not have \na clear diagnosis after a complete evaluation. \n2. Options include \na. Empiric treatment for the most likely cause \nb. Further testing with culture or rapid point of care \ndiagnostic tests \nc. Testing for cervical infection \nd. Observation \nTreatment \nA. Bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women is treated with oral \nmetronidazole or intravaginal metronidazole or clindamycin. \nB. The recommended treatment for trichomoniasis in nonpreg-\nnant women is tinidazole or metronidazole. Treatment of sex-\nual partners is necessary, and sexual intercourse should not be \nresumed until both partners are treated and symptoms resolve. \nC. The recommended treatment for uncomplicated vulvovaginal \ncandidiasis in nonprcgnant women is a short course of topical \nantifungals or a single dose of oral fluconazole. \nD. Atrophic vaginitis is treated with intravaginal estrogen. \nDYSURIA I 303 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Pyelonephritis \nTextbook Presentation \nPyelonephritis typically presents with dysuria and flank or back \npain, fever, chills, malaise, nausea and vomiting. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Pyelonephritis is an infection affecting the parenchyma of the \nkidney. \nB. Bacterial pathogens arc identical to those that cause cystitis. \nC. Uncomplicated pyelonephritis occurs in immunocompetent \nwomen with normal urinary tracts and without reduced kid-\nney function. \nD. Complicated pyelonephritis is present if the patient is \n1. Male \n2. Pregnant \n3. Immunosuppressed \n4. Has urinary obstruction, nephrolithiasis, foreign-body/ \ncatheters, or kidney dysfunction \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History often includes symptoms of cystitis with flank or back \npain, fever, chills, malaise, and nausea or vomiting. \nB. CVA tenderness on physical exam suggests pyelonephritis \nbut is actually nondiagnostic (LR+ 1.1-2.S and \nLR- 0.78--0.96). \nC. Urinalysis or urine dipstick testing also aids diagnosis with the \nsame findings as cystitis. \nD. Urine culture is indicated for all patients with suspected pye-\nlonephritis. Urine culture is positive in 90% of patients with \npyelonephritis. \nE. Imaging (CT or ultrasonography) is indicated if there is con-\ncern for concomitant nephrolithiasis or obstruction or if the \ndiagnosis is uncertain. \nTreatment \nA. Many patients with pyelonephritis can be treated as \noutpatients. \nB. Indications for admission include the following: \n1. Unstable vital signs \n2. Inability to tolerate oral medications \n3. Concern for nonadherence \n4. Pregnancy \n5. Immunocompromised state \n6. Concern for urinary tract obstruction or ncphrolithiasis \nC. Outpatient management \n1. The flrst~line empiric therapy is a fluoroquinolone (iflocal \nE coli resistance docs not exceed 20%). \n2. A single IV dose of ceftriaxone or a long-acting \naminoglycoside is recommended before outpatient therapy \nif fluoroq uinolone resistance exceeds 10%. \n3. Treatment should be adjusted once antimicrobial \nsusceptibility results are available. \n4. Duration of antibiotic therapy \na. 7-10 days for uncomplicated pyelonephritis \nb. 14 days for complicated pyelonephritis \n\n304 I CHAPTER 16 \n5. Follow-up \na. Patients should be seen in 24-72 hours to ensure \nclinical improvement. \nb. If fever persists beyond 48-72 hours of appropriate \nantibiotics or illness worsens, the patient should be \nadmitted for IV antibiotics and further evaluation. \nD. Inpatient management \n1. Patients who are admitted for treatment should be given \nIV antibiotics (a fluoroquinolone, ceftriaxone, or an \naminoglycoside with or without ampicillin). \n2. Treatment duration should be for 14 days. \n3. If fever, pain, or vomiting has not improved in 48-72 hours \nof appropriate therapy, the following 2 options should be \nconsidered: \na. Obtain imaging (CT scan or ultrasonography) to \nevaluate for complications, such as a perinephric abscess, \nkidney stone, or obstruction. \nb. Broaden antibiotic coverage to cover for resistant \norganisms if susceptibility data have not returned. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. C is a 5 7-year-old man who complains of dysuria that \nstarted suddenly 5 days ago. He reports the pain radiates \nto his loback and perineum. He has felt \"'achy\" and had \nchills but has not measured his temperature. He denies any \npenile dlscha rge, rash, nausea, vomiting, or flank pain. He has \nhad more dtfficulty urinating with a weaker urinary stream \nfor the past fedays. He also feels some dizziness upon \nstanding. \nAt this point what is the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active alternatlVB!i, and le there a \nmu5t not mf55 dlagno5151 Given thl5 differential \ndlagnoele, what tnte ehould be ordered? \nPRIORITIZING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. C is experiencing dysuria with radiation to the perineum \nand associated urinary hesitancy. His sex and the radiation of the \npain are pivotal points in this history, suggesting acute prostatitis. \nAcute prostatitis is a life-threatening cause of dysuria. Urosepsis \nis another must not miss diagnosis given the systemic symptoms \nand orthostasis. The absence of penile discharge is important in \nlimiting the list of diagnoses. Other common but less dangerous \nalternatives include urethritis from an STI and complicated cysti-\ntis. Pydonephritis should also be considered. Table 16-4 lists the \ndifferential diagnosis. \nMr. C Is sexually active with several female partners and \ndoes not use condoms or other tJarrler protection. He has \nno active medical problems but has noted nocturia over the \npast femonths. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nNo additional testing or urine culture was performed for \nMs. D since she had no history of recurrent UTI or ot her \ncompllca'tlng factors. She was given empiric antibiotics of \nnl'trofurantoln 1 00 mg 'twice daily for 5 days based on t he \nreglonal E coll resistance pattems. Her symptoms resolved \nwith treatment. \nIt is important to knolocal E co/i resistance \npatterns when prescribing empiric antibiotics \nfor cystitis because resistance to fl.uoroquinolo-\nnes and TMP-S.MX is not uncommon. \nTemperature is 38.2C, pulse 80 bpm. RR 12 lm:at hs \nper minute. BP 142/78 mm Hg. and orthost atlc vital signs \nare negative. Abdominal exam demonst rates suprapublc \ntenderness without rebound or guarding and the absence \nof CVA tenderness. Genital exam is normal, but there is \ntenderness on gentle prostate exam without any palpable \nmasses. \nLeading Hypothesis: Acute Prostatitis \nTextbook Presentation \nAcute prostatitis typically presents with dysuria, loback pain, \nperineal pain or ejaculatory pain with fever, chills, and myalgias. \nPatients often have associated urinary symptoms including fre-\nquency, urgency, or obstruction. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Acute bacterial prostatitis is an infection of the prostate gland \nthat occurs from an ascending urethral infection or through \nreflux of infected urine into the prostate through the ejacula-\ntory or prostatic ducts. \nB. Frequent pathogens include gram-negative coliform bacteria, \nE co/i, Kkbsiella, Proteu.s, enterococci, and Psew:lomonAS. \nC. Sexually transmitted bacteria, such as Gonorrhea and Chlamy-\ndia, may also be the cause. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Although prostatitis may present with classic symptoms of \nloback pain, dysuria, and perineal pain, the disease may also \npresent with nonspeciflc symptoms such as myalgias, mal-\naise, or nausea and vomiting. Patients may also present with \nobstructive symptoms, such as, hesitancy, incomplete voiding, \nand weak stream. \n\nTable 16-4.

On physical exam, the prostate gland may be tender, warm, \nswollen, or firm. \nC. Theoretically, infection may be induced or worsened by rig-\norous digital rectal exam so this is not recommended if acute \nbacterial prostatitis is suspected. \nD. Prostate massage \n1. Traditionally, prostatic massage to examine prostatic \nsecretions for white blood cdls and bacteria has been \nadvocated. \n2. This test has not been validated, and it is not recommended \nbecause it is difficult to perform, painful, and may worsen \ninfection. \nE. Urinalysis or urine dipstick \n1. May shosigns consistent with cystitis (eg, leukocyte \nesterase, nitrites, or white blood cells) \n2. May also be normal \nF. Often the pathogen will be identified by urine culture; how-\never, urine culture can be negative in acute prostatitis. \nG. A urine sample should be sent for polymerase chain reaction \n(PCR) testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia if a sexually trans-\nmitted pathogen is suspected. \nDYSURIA I 305 \nH. A post void residual should be determined in patients in \nwhom obstruction is suspected. \nI. Diagnosis is made based on a combination of the history, \nphysical exam, and urine studies. No single test is diagnostic \nfor acute prostatitis. \nTreatment \nA. First-line antibiotics include a fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX. \nIf an STI is likely, treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia \nshould also be given. \nB. While nitrofurantoin is used to treat cystitis, it is ineffective in \nprostatitis because it does not penetrate the prostate well. \nC. The duration of antibiotics should be at least 4-6 weeks. \nD. Treatment with pain medications and stool softeners are also \nhelpful. \nE. Patients with severe infection or medically complex patients \nshould be admitted for IV antibiotic therapy. \nF. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be evaluated \nfor a prostatic abscess. Although a prostatic abscess may be \npalpable on exam, CT, MRI, or cransrectal ultrasonography \nare required to confirm diagnosis. Drainage or resection can \nbe necessary. \nG. Prostatitis will elevate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. C'5 urlnaly5l5 15 po51tlve for leukocyte e5tera5e. \n10 WBC5 per high power fleld, and 5 RBC5 per high power \nfleld. Hl5 CBC 5hows a WBC count of 8000/mcL and basic \nmetabolic panel shows a creatinine of 1.0, similar to his \nprevious baseline. \n~ \nHave you croseed a diagnostic threshold for \n1~r the leading h)'pOtheefe, aeute proetatftie1 \nHave you ruled out the active alternatives? \nDo other teete need to be done to mcclude tha \naltemativa diagnoses? \nThe urinalyi;is findings together with the tender prostate on phys-\nical exam support the presumed diagnosis of acute prostatitis as \nopposed to complicated cystitis or urethritis. Urosepsis is less likely \ngiven the reassuring vital signs and absence of syi;temic inflam-\nmatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria (presence of 2 of the \nfollowing: WBC > 12,000/mcL, WBC < 4000 /mcL, temperature \n> 38.0C, hypothermia < 36.0\"C, heart rate > 90 bpm, or respira-\ntory rate> 20 breaths per minute). Diagnosis could be confirmed \nby culture of prostatic fluid but rigorous examination in the patient \nwould be contraindicated because it could increase the severity \nof infection. Urine culture and PCR testing for gonorrhea and \nchlamydia will help identify bacterial pathogens. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Urethritis from STls \n(Cervicitis in Women) \nTextbook Presentation \nUrethritis in men typically presents with dysuria, urethral pruritus, \nand penile discharge. Patients may also have dyi;pareunia, abdom-\ninal pain, or testicular pain. Women with cervicitis typically have \n\n306 I CHAPTER 16 \ncervical discharge, d~uria. and d~pareunia. They may also have \nspontaneous or postcoital vaginal bleeding. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Urethritis and cervicitis are usually due to an STI. \nB. The most common sexually transmitted pathogens causing \ncervicitis and urethritis are N gono\"hoeae and C trachomatis. \nC. Other less common causes include \n1. Mycoplasma genitalium \n2. Trichomonas \n3. Herpes simplex virus (may also cause cervicitis) \n4. Adenovirus \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Urethritis can be difficult to distinguish from cystitis in men. \nIn a man with d~uria, STI testing is often warranted. Urethri-\ntis can be diagnosed based on: \nI. History or presence of discharge, with or without: \na. Microscopy of discharge showing > 5 WBCs per oil \nimmersion field (sensitivity, 26%; specificity, 95%; \nLR+, 2.7) \nb. Positive leukocyte esterase on first-void urine \nc. Microscopy of first-void urine showing > 10 WBCs per \nhigh power field \nd. Gram stain of discharge or urine culrure that identifies \norganisms \n2. Absence of discharge and any of the following: \na. positive STI testing (see PCR below} \nb. Inability to identify organisms on urine culture and \nlack of response to appropriate empiric treatment for \ncystitis \nB. Cervicitis can be diagnosed by identifying mucopurulent \nendocervical discharge on pelvic exam. Sustained cervical \nbleeding caused by gentle passage of a swab in the cervical os \nmay also be seen. \nC. PCR \n1. To confirm the diagnosis of urethritis or cervicitis, an \nendocervical, vaginal, urine or urethral sample should be \nsent for PCR testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia. \n2. Urine PCR is the preferred test for males (sensitivity and \nspecificity 90--100% and 97-100%, respectively). \n3. Vaginal, cervical, and urine testing are considered \nequivalent for women, and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC) advocates using any type \nof sample. \nTreatment \nA. Patients should be treated empirically prior to confirmation of \na pathogen. \nB. The first-line treatment for chlamydia is a 1-time dose of 1 g \nof oral azithromycin or a 1-week course of 100 mg of doxycy-\ncline given tWice daily. \nC. Concurrent treatment for gonorrhca should be given if there is \nclinical suspicion or gonorrhea prevalence in the patient pop-\nulation is high. \nD. The first-line treatment for gonorrhea is a I-time injection of \nccftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and a 1-time dose of 1 g \nof oral azithromycin. \nE. Given increased antimicrobial resistance of gonorrhca, \nthe CDC recommends dual therapy with ceftriaxone and \nazithromycin. \nF. Patients should abstain from intercourse until 1 week after a \nsingle-dose treatment or until completion of a 1-week regimen \n(assuming symptoms have also resolved}. \nG. Partners \n1. Sexual partners of all patients infected with an STI should \nbe evaluated and treated. \n2. If partners are unable to be seen at a health practice, the \nCDC recommends expedited partner treatment (the \nph~ician gives the patient a prescription for their partner). \nThe laws regarding this practice vary by state. \nH. Repeat testing to establish cure is not necessary unless symp-\ntoms persist or reinfection or nonadhercnce is suspected. \nI. Due to the high risk of repeat infections, it is recommended \nthat patients be retested 3-12 months after initial infection. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Urosepsis \nTextbook Presentation \nUrosepsis typically presents with fever, chills, hypotension, and \nlethargy or altered mental status. Symptoms of the underlying \ninfection, such as dysuria or flank pain, are often present. (See \nChapter 25, Hypotension, for extensive discussion on sepsis.} \nDisease Highlights \nA. Sepsis is defined as a suspected or proven infection with the \npresence of the SIRS criteria. \nB. Severe sepsis occurs when there is target organ d~function, \nsuch as hypotension, hypoxemia, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, \nthrombocytopenia, or obtundation. \nC. Urosepsis occurs when the infectious source of sepsis is an \ninfection of the urinary or male genital tract. \nD. It is estimated that 25% of sepsis cases are due to a urogenital \ninfection. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosil \nDiagnosis is made based on SIRS criteria {see above) and the con-\nfirmation of a genitourinary infection. \nTreatment \nA. All patients with suspected urosepsis should be hospitalized. \nAdmission to the ICU is often necessary. \nB. Early empiric IV antibiotics and aggressive volume resuscitation \nwith IV fluids should be initiated to prevent worsening sepsis. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. C was treated empirically with ciprofloxacin. 500 m{l \ntwice dally, and azithromycin, 1 g for 1 dose, for acute \nbacterial prost atltls. Results of the urine culture showed \n150,000 CFU of E co/lsusceptlbletofluoroqulnolones. The \nurine PCR for gonorrhea and eh lamydla was negative.Treat-\nment with ciprofloxacin was continued for 21 days, and his \nsymptoms resolved. He continued to have nocturia. and \ntreatment for BPH was started. \n\nREFERENCES \nAnderson MR, Klink K. Cohrssen A. Eval112tion of vaginal complaints.

It is useful to reviesome background \npathophysiology before discussing the differential diagnosis: \nA. Distribution of total body water \nl. 67% intracdlular; 33% cxttacdlular \n2. Extracellular water: 25% inttavascular; 75% interstitial \nB. Regulation of fluid distribution between the inttavascular and \ninterstitial spaces \nl. There is a constant exchange of water and solutes at the \narteriolar end of the capillaries. \n2. Fluid is returned from the interstitial space to the \nintravascular space at the venous end of the capillaries and \nvia the lymphatics. \n3. Movement of fluid from the intravascular space to the \ninterstitium occurs through several mechanisms: \na. Capillary hydrostatic (hydraulic) pressure pushes fluid \nout of the vessels. \nb. Interstitial oncotic pressure pulls fluid into the \nintcrstitiwn. \nc. Capillary permeability allows fluid to escape into the \nintcrstitiwn. \n4. Movement of fluid from the interstitium to the inttavascular \nspace occurs when opposite pressures predominate. \na. lntravascular (plasma) oncotic pressure from plasma \nproteins pulls fluid into the vascular space. \nb. Interstitial hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid out of the \nintcrstitiwn. \nS. In skdetal muscle, the capillary hydrostatic pressure and the \nintravascular oncotic pressure are the most important fu:tors. \n6. There is normally a small gradient fu.voring filtration out of \nthe vascular space into the interstitium; the excess fluid is \nremoved via the lymphatic system. \nC. Edema formation occurs when there is \nl. An increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure (for example, \nincreased plasma volume due to renal sodium retention). \n2. An increase in capillary permeability (for example, burns, \nangioedema). \n3. An increase in interstitial oncotic pressure (for example, \nmyxcdcma). \n4. A decrease in plasma oncotic pressure (for example, \nhypoalbuminemia). \nS. Lymphatic obstruction. \nAlthough it is possible to construct a pathophysiologic frame-\nwork (Figure 17-1) for the differential diagnosis of cdcma, it is \nmore useful clinically to use the distribution of the ednna as the \npivotal point: \nA.

She has no history of he.art or \nkidney disease or tobacco or .alcohol use. \n~ \nAt thle polnt, what le the leading hypotheele, \n1~JI\"' and what are the active alternatives? What \nother teete should be ordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nEven before examining Mrs. V, you can see that she has signifi~ \ncant bilateral leg edema, a pivotal point in her presentation. \nAlthough there are some local diseases that can present with \nbilateral leg edema, the flrst step in such patients is always to look \n\n312 I CHAPTER 17 \nfor systemic causes. While the history and phyi;ical are often not \nsensitive or specific enough to make a diagnosis, they are a good \nstarting point for organizing the differential. So, the first question \nro ask is, \"Does Mrs. V have any signs, symptoms, or risk factors \npointing to a cardiac, hepatic, or renal cause of her edema?\" The \nresults of this exploration will help rank the differential. Mrs. V's \nhistory of a blood transfusion puts her at risk for chronic hepatitis \nand cirrhosis, and her vague abdominal complaints raise the pos-\nsibility of ascites, more commonly seen with cirrhosis than HF or \nkidney disease. She is certainly at risk for both heart and kidney \ndisease because of her history of hypertension and diabetes. While \nmost patients with HF complain of shortness of breath, some \ndescribe only fatigue. Medication should be considered as a cause, \nsince pioglitazone frequently causes edema; hypothyroidism does \nnot cause pitting edema, and so is not likely. Finally, although it is \nuncommon for obstruction to cause bilateral edema, you should \nthink about ovarian cancer causing malignant ascites and venous \nobstruction if another cause is not found. Table 17-1 lists the \ndifferential diagnosis. \n~ \nAlwayi; look for syi;temic causes of edema in \n,..,,... \npatients with bilateral leg edema. \nTable 17-1.

Genetic metabolic diseases (Wilson disease, alpha-1-\nantitrypsin deficiency, glycogen storage diseases, \nporphyria) \nd. Infections (schistosomiasis, echinococcosis, brucellosis) \ne. Cardiac \nf. Primary or secondary biliary cirrhosis \nThe 2 most common causes of cirrhosis in the \nUnited States are alcoholic liver disease and \nchronic hepatitis C. \nB. Pathophysiology \nI. Advanced fibrosis, or cirrhosis, causes architecrural \ndistortion of the hepatic vascularure and endothelial \ndysfunction, leading to \na. Shunting of the blood coming into the liver via the \nportal vein directly to the hepatic vein outflosyi;tem \nb. Impaired hepatocyte function due to loss of normal \nsinusoids \nc. Increased intrahepatic resistance, or portal hypertension \nd. Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma related to \nregenerative activity and DNA damage \n2. Consequences of cirrhosis and portal hypertension include \na. Formation of portosystemic collaterals (ie, varices) \nb. Splanchnic vasodilation \n\nc. Renal vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion of the \nkidneys, causing salt and water retention \nd. Increased cardiac output \ne. Decreased production of albumin and clotting factors \nf. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure \ng. Edema due to a combination of salt and water retention \n(increasing hydrostatic pressures) and hypoalbuminemia \n(decreasing intravascular oncotic pressure) \nC. Prognosis \n1. Median survival from time of diagnosis of compensated \ncirrhosis is 10--13 years. \n2. Up to 60% of patients progress to decompensated cirrhosis, \ndefined as worsening portal hypertension and decreased \nhepatic reserve, at 10 years after diagnosis. \n3. Rates of progression are quite variable and are related to \nthe etiology of the cirrhosis, presence of other liver disease, \navailable treatment (such as for chronic hepatitis Band C), \nand avoidance of hepatic toxins (such as alcohol). \n4. 5-year mortality approaches 85% after decompensation if \ntransplantation is not performed. \na. In patients with cirrhosis but no varices and no ascites, \nthe 1-year mortality rate is 1 %. \nb. In those with varices but no ascites, the 1-year mortality \nrate is 3.4%. \nc. In those with varices and ascites, the 1-year mortality \nrate is 20%; in those with variceal bleeding and ascites, \nthe 1-year mortality is 57%. \n5. The Child-Pugh classification of cirrhosis severity predicts \nprognosis (see Chapter 19, GI Bleeding). \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Cirrhosis is a pathologic diagnosis definitively made only \nby examining the entire liver at autopsy or after liver \ntransplantation. \nB. The clinical presentation is variable, making clinical diagnosis \ndifficult. \n1. Patients may have physical findings suggestive of chronic \nliver disease (see below), constitutional symptoms, \nasymptomatic liver enzyme or radiologic abnormalities, \nmanifestations of portal hypertension (see below}, or no \nsymptoms at all. Cirrhosis is sometimes diagnosed at \nautopsy in patients in whom the disease never manifested. \n2. Physical findings may increase the likelihood that a patient \nwith liver disease has cirrhosis, but rarely rule out cirrhosis \n(Table 17-2). \n3. Patients who shomanifestations of portal hypertension \n(see below) are assumed to have cirrhosis. \nC. Laboratory tests \n1. A loplatelet count in a patient with liver disease increases \nthe probability of cirrhosis. \na. Platelet count< 110 x 103/mcL: LR+ = 9.8 \nb. Platelet count< 160 x 103/mcL: LR+ = 6.3; LR- = 0.29 \n2. Albumin< 3.5 g/dL (LR+ = 4.4) and a prolonged \ninternational normalized ratio (INR) (LR+ = 5.0) also \nincrease the likelihood of cirrhosis. \n3. The Bonacini cirrhosis discriminant score combines \nthe alanine aminotransferase:aspartate aminotransferase \n(ALT:AST) ratio, the platelet count, and the INR into \na score from 0-11; scores > 7 increase the likelihood of \ncirrhosis (LR+ = 9.4). \nEDEMA I 313 \nTable 17-2.

The traditional gold standard is percutaneous liver biopsy; \nhowever, noninvasive methods are being used more frequently \nbecause of poor sensitivity and risks of biopsy. \nI.

Risk of complications of biopsy \na. Serious bleeding= 0.6% \nb. Injury to other organs = 0.08% \nE. Noninvasive techniques for diagnosing cirrhosis \nI. Direct serologic measures of flbrogenesis such \nas FibroSURE (includes the biomarkers alpha-2 \nmacroglobulin, haptoglobin, gamma-glutam yl \ntranspeptidase, apolipoprotein A1, ALT, and total \nbilirubin). \na. Useful for distinguishing mild fibrosis from cirrhosis \nbut less accurate in identifying moderate fibrosis \nb. False-positive results possible in patients with chronic \ninflammatory conditions, chronic kidney disease, or \nextrahepatic causes of flbrogenesis \n2. Liver elastography \na. Measures liver stiffness, which correlates with cirrhosis \nb. Multiple approaches to the technique are available; \nvibration-controlled transient elastography {VCTE) is \nmost widely available. \nc. See Table 17-3 for the LR+ and LR- ofVCTE in \npatients with common causes of cirrhosis. \nF. Test characteristics of ultrasound to diagnose cirrhosis are \nvariable (LR+, 2.5-11.6; LR-, 0.13-0.73). \nG. MRI has sensitivity and specificity as high as 93% and 82%, \nrespectively. \nTreatment \nOnce it has been determined that the patient probably or defin-\nitively has cirrhosis, it is important to determine the specific \ncause of the cirrhosis (see Chapter 26, Jaundice & Abnormal \nLiver Enzymes) and to determine whether the patient has \nhepatic encephalopathy or manifestations of portal hypertension: \n\n314 I CHAPTER 17 \nTable 17-3.

Epidemiology \n1. Over 10 years, ascites develops in 47% of patients with \ncirrhosis. \n2. 15% of patients who are diagnosed with ascites die within \n1 year \nB. Pathophysiology: See Figure 17-3 \nC. Complications of ascites \n1. Respiratory compromise due to compression oflung \nvolumes \n2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): a syndrome of acute kidney \ninjury associated with cirrhosis and a poor prognosis, \ncaused by shunts redirecting blood away from the kidneys. \na. Diagnostic criteria \n(1) Cirrhosis with ascites \n(2) Serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL \n(3) Serum creatinine stays above 1.5 mg/dL after at \nleast 2 days of diuretic withdrawal and volume \nexpansion with albumin. \n(4) Absence of shock \n(5) No current or recent treatment with nephrotoxic \ndrugs \n(6) Absence of parenchymal kidney disease \n(< 500 mg/day of proteinuria, < 50 RBC/hpf, \nabnormalities on renal ultrasound) \nb. A.cute kidney injury may be acute (type 1) or subacute \n(type 2). \n(1) Type 1 HRS: doubling of serum creatinine to \n> 2.5 mg/dL in< 2 weeks; frequently follows a \nprecipitating event \n(2) Type 2 HRS: steady increase in creatinine over \nweeks to months; mainly presents as diuretic-\nresistant ascites \nc. Incidence in patients with cirrhosis and ascites is 18% at \n1 year and 35% at 5 years. \nd. The prognosis is poor: 6-month mortality is about 50% \nfor patients with type 2 HRS and 100% for those with \ntype 1. \ne. Precipitants of type 1 HRS include bacterial infections \n(especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP]), GI \nbleeding, acute hepatitis, over-diuresis, and large volume \nparacentesis. \nf. Treatment of HRS \n(1) Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for \nboth types of HRS. \n(2) There are limited data regarding the use of \nuansvenous intrahepatlc portosystemic shunts (TIPS) \nand vasopressin derivatives to treat type 1 HRS. \n3. SBP \na. Prevalence of 10-30% in hospitalized cirrhotic patients, \nwith 1-year recurrence rate of70% and mortality \nrate of about 20%; 96% of patients with SBP have a \nChild-Pugh grade ofB or C \nb. Overgrowth of intestinal bacterial and increased \nintestinal permeability lead to movement of bacteria \ninto mesenteric lymph nodes; the bacteria can then enter \nthe systemic circulation and colonize the ascitic fluid. \nc. The 4 most common isolates are Escherichia coli, \nStrtptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Klebsielia pneumoniae. \nd. Symptoms can range from silent in 13% of patients to \novert; typical symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, \nnausea/vomiting, malaise, and mental status changes. \n~ \nSBP can present with many fmdings other than \n,,.... abdominal pain. \ne. Risk factors for SBP include ascitic fluid total protein \nlevel S 1 g/dL, upper GI bleeding, a prior episode of \nSBP, and use of proton pump inhibitors. \nf. Diagnosis of SBP \n(1) Criteria for performing a diagnostic paracentesis in \npatients with cirrhosis and ascites: \n(a) Admission to the hospital for any reason \n(b) Change in clinical status (fever, abdominal pain, \nmental status changes, ileus, septic shock) \n(c) Development ofleukocytosis, acidosis, or acute \nkidney injury \n(d) Active GI bleeding \n(2) Always inoculate blood culture tubes with ascitic \nfluid at the bedside to maximize yield of fluid \ncultures. \n(3) Interpretation of ascitic fluid cell counts and \ncultures {Table 17-4) \n~ \nConsider secondary peritonitis if more than \n,,.... 1 organism is cultured from the ascitic fluid. \n\nCirrhosis \nPortal hypertension \nSplanchnic arterial \nvasodilatation \nReduced effective arterial \nblood volume \nHypotenslon \nGut bacterial translocation \nDecreased opsonlc activity \nSpontaneous bacterial \nperitonitis \nIncreased nitric oxide \nWorsening hyperdynamlc circulation \nDecreased systemic vascular resistance \nActivation of neurohormonal mechanisms \nRenln-angiotensin-aldosterone system \nSympathetic nervous system \nArginine vasopressin \nSequestration of ftuid \nFormation ot ascites \nDecreased cardiac reserve \nIntense renal vasoconstrlctlon \nCritically impaired cardiac \nreserve \nHepatorenal syndrome type 1 \nEDEMA I 315 \nAttempt to incl'98.Se blood pressure \nSodium retention \nWater retention \nRenal vasoconstriction \nHyponatremia \nRefractory ascites \nHepatorenal syndrome type 2 \nSepsis \nOrgan failure \nDeath \nThe peripheral and vasodilatation hypothesis states that as cirrhosis progresses, systemic vasodilatation from reduced systemic vascular \nresistance and the sequestration of fluid into the peritoneal cavity result in arterial underfilling and activation of salt-retaining neurohormonal \nmechanisms such as the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to counteract loarterial blood \npressures. Consequently, although plasma and blood volume are increased, effective arterial blood volume is decreased. These circulatory \nchanges, along with the development of sodium and water retention and the formation of ascites, are an adaptive compensatory response \naimed at maintaining adequate cardiac output and organ perfusion. \nFigure 17-3. Pathophysiologyof cirrhosis.

Treatment of SBP \n(I) Empiric treatment should be started before culture \nresults rerurn. \n(2) IV cefotaxime is the best-studied antibiotic for SBP; \noral ofloxacin can be used in outpatients without \nsigns of sepsis or hepatic encephalopathy. \n(3) IV albumin has been shown to reduce monality and \ndevelopment of kidney dysfunction, particularly \nin patients with a total bilirubin > 4 mgldL, BUN \n> 30 mg/dL, or creatinine > 1 mg/dL. \n\n316 I CHAPTER 17 \nTable 17-4.

Physical exam: See Chapter 26, Jaundice & Abnormal \nLiver Enzymes \nB. Peritoneal fluid analysis should be done in all patients with \nneascites. \nI. Initial tests should include cell count, albumin, total \nprotein, and culture. \n2. Serum-ascites albumin gradient is used to distinguish ascites \ndue to portal hypertension from ascites due to other causes. \na. In ponal hypenension, ascites occurs due to \ntransudation, without changes in permeability that \nwould alloalbumin to leak into the ascitic fluid. \nb. Therefore, the albumin content of ascitic fluid is lo\nrelative to serum. \nc. This is in contrast to exudative types of ascites, such as \nascites from infection or malignancy, in which albumin \ncan leak into the ascitic fluid. \nd. A serum ascites-albumin gradient (serum albumin-ascitic \nfluid albumin) oh 1.1 mg/dL has a LR+ of 4.6 for the \ndiagnosis of ascites due to portal hypenension; a serum \nascites-albumin gradient of< 1.1 mg/dL has a LR- of \n0.06 for the diagnosis of ponal hypertension. \nTreatment \nA. Sodium restriction (sodium intake< 2 g/day) is commonly \nrecommended, but there are no clinical trials showing that it leads \nto improved outcomes; fluid restriction of 1000-1500 mUday is \nrecommended if the serum sodium is < 130 mEq/L. \nB. Spironolactone is the diuretic of choice to treat the aldosterone \ndriven salt and water retention seen in cirrhosis. \nI. 75% of patients respond \n2. Furosemide or other loop diuretics can be added in patients \nwho do not respond to spironolactone alone; 90% of \npatients respond to sodium-restricted diets, spironolactone, \nand loop diuretics. \n3. Hydrochlorothiazide and metolazone arc not recommended. \n4. In order to avoid hypovolemia and kidney dysfunction, \nthe rate of weight loss should not exceed 0.5 kg/day in the \nabsence of peripheral edema or 1 kg/day in the presence of \nedema. \nAspirin and NSAIDs blunt the natriuretic \neffect of diuretics and should not be used in \npatients with ascites. \nC. Large volume paracentesis with volume expansion (dextran \nor albumin) is done in patients unresponsive to diuretics. \nD. TIPS \n1. Creates a shunt between the high-pressure ponal vein \nand the low-pressure hepatic vein, leading to improved \nhemodynamics and a decrease in ascites. \n2. Complications include bleeding, shunt stenosis or \nthrombosis, right-sided HF, and encephalopathy in 30% \nof patients. \n3. Can be considered in patients who do not respond \nadequately to diuretic therapy \n4. Used as a bridge to transplant \nE. Liver transplantation \n3. Hepatic Encephalopathy \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation of hepatic encephalopathy is a patient with \nknown cirrhosis who has mental status changes or is in a coma. \nDisease Highlights \nA. A spectrum of reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen \nin patients with cirrhosis \nB. Must exclude other neurologic or metabolic causes prior to \ndiagnosing hepatic encephalopathy such as: \n1. Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar \nsyndrome \n2. Alcohol intoxication, withdrawal, or Wernicke encephalopathy \n3. Drugs (eg, benzodiazepines, opioids, neuroleptics) \n4. Infection \n5. Electrolyte abnormalities (eg, azotemia, hyponatremia, \nhypercalcemia) \nC. Overt hepatic encephalopathy (Table 17-5, grades 1-4) is \nfound in 30-45% of patients with cirrhosis. \nD. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (deficits manifested only on \nneuropsychological testing) is found in 60% of patients with \ncirrhosis. \nE. Patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy requiring \nhospitalization have a 1-year survival rate of< 50%. \nF. Can be precipitated by a wide variety of insults including \n1. Infections \n2. GI bleeding \n3. Constipation \n4, Dehydration \nS. Electrolyte abnormalities \n6. Surgical or intrahepatic shunts (eg, TIPS) \n\nEDEMA I 317 \nTable 17-5.

There is some correlation between the degree of elevation \nof ammonia (either arterial or venous) and the severity of \nthe encephalopathy, but the ammonia level cannot be used to \ndetermine the presence or absence of hepatic encephalopathy. \nB. Diagnosis is based on history and exclusion of other causes of \nencephalopathy in a patient with significant liver dysfunction. \nTreaunent \nA. Identify and treat precipitating causes \nB. Patients with an episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy \nshould be treated indd1nitely; the approach to minimal \nhepatic encephalopathy is evolving. \nC. Treatment focuses on reduction of intestinal accumulation \nof ammonia. \nD. Lactulose removes both dietary and endogenous sources of \nammonia through its cathartic action; it also lowers pH, \nwhich reduces the population of urease-producing bacteria, \nand traps ammonia as ammonium ions in the gut lumen. \n1. First-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy \n2. Daily dose should be titrated to result in 3 soft stools/day. \n3. Complications include hypovolemia and hypernatremia. \nE. Antibiotics reduce the population of urease-producing \nbacteria. \n1. Rifaximin in combination with lactulose has been shown to \ndecrease recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy. \n2. Neomycin in combination with lactulose has also been \nshown to be effective, however its potential to cause \nototoxicity and nephrotoxicity limits its use. \nF. Consideration of liver transplantation is indicated in patients \nwith hepatic encephalopathy. \n4. Hypersplenism \nTatbook Presentation \nCytopenias are found on routine blood testing in a patient \nwith cirrhosis. \nDecerebration \nPresent \nDisease Highlights \nA. Splenomegaly is found in 36-92% of patients with cirrhosis; \n11-55% have the clinical syndrome ofhypersplenism, defined \nas the presence of splenomegaly with a reduction of 1 or more \ncellular elements of the blood \nB. There is a rough corrdation between spleen size and degree of \ndecrease in blood cdls. \nC. Blood cell abnormalities in liver disease \n1. Thrombocytopenia is due to \na.

Often multifactorial \nb. Sometimes not included in discussions of hypersplenism \nc. Common mechanisms include: \n(1) Increased destruction in the spleen \n(2) Iron and folate deflciency \n(3) Reduced erythropoietin production \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Hypersplenism is a clinical syndrome without a specific set of \ndiagnostic criteria. \nB. Hypersplenism is based on physical exam or radiologic \nfindings of splenomegaly and the presence of cytopenia \non laboratory results. \nTreatment \nA. Treatment is usually not necessary. \nB. Splenectomy or partial splenic embolization is sometimes done \nfor severe thrombocytopenia with bleeding complications. \nC. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and \nerythropoietin are rarely used. \nD. TIPS does not correct thrombocytopenia. \n\n318 I CHAPTER 17 \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nInitial laboratory test results follow: WBC, 9700/mcL; \nHb, 10.5 g/GIL; HGT, 31%; MCV, 86 mcm;,; platelet, \n123,000/mcL; electrolytes normal; BUN, 8 mg/GIL; cre-\natlnlne, 0.4 mg/dL; glucose, 97 mg/dL; albumln, 2.1 g/dL; \nallcallne phosphatase, 95 unlts/L; total blllrubln, 1.2 mg/GIL; \nALT, 102 units/L; AST, 66 units/L; PT/ITT normal; urinaly-\nsis, 2+ protein with no cells or casts. \n~ \nHave you crossed a diagnostic thnsehold for \n1~r the leading hyPothesis, cirrhosie and portal \nhypsrtenelon1 Have you ruled out the active \nalternatlvee1 Do other tests need to ~e done \nto e><c:lude the alternative dlagnoHe1 \nThe physical exam findings of splenomegaly and ascites, along with \nthe laboratory abnormalities of thrombocytopenia, elevated tran-\nsaminases, and hypoalbuminemia, are all consistent with chronic \nliver disease. The absence of pulmonary crackles and devation of \nthe jugular venous pressure make HF unlikdy. However, the find-\nings of proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia are also consistent with \nnephrotic syndrome. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Nephrotic Syndrome \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with nephrotic syndrome classically have edema (often \nperiorbital), hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and \nat least 3.5 g/24 hour of proteinuria. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Etiology \n1. Primary glomerular diseases \na. Etiology uncertain but probably immune mediated \nb. Most common pathologies found in adults are \nmembranous and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis \n(33% each}, with membranous being more common in \nwhite patients and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis \nmore common in black patients. \nc. Less common pathologies found in adults are minimal \nchange disease (15%) and membranoproliferative \nglomerular disease (including IgA nephropathy) (14%). \nd. In patients over age 65 who undergo kidney biopsy \n(recognizing that many patients with presumed diabetic \nnephropathy do not have a biopsy), approximately \n15% have minimal change disease, 30-40% have \nmembranous nephropathy, and 10-12% have \namyloidosis. \n2. Secondary glomerular disease \na. Diabetes is the most common cause in the \nUnited States. \nb. Systemic lupus erythematosus generally causes an \ninflammatory nephritis, but sometimes causes a \nnoninflammatory, membranous pathology. \nc. Amyloidosis and plasma cell mydoma (formerly \nmultiple myeloma} should be considered in patients \nover age 40. \nd. Infections commonly associated with nephrotic \nsyndrome include HIY, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, \nsyphilis, and malaria. \ne. Malignancies, especially lung, breast, prostate, and \ncolon cancer as well as Hodgkin lymphoma are \nassociated with nephrotic syndrome. \n(1) 5-25% of patients with membranous \nnephropathy have a malignancy, with the \nassociation being strongest for patients over \n60 years old. \n(2) The cancer may be diagnosed at the same time \nas the kidney disease but often is found later. \nf. Many drugs, including NSAIDs, captopril, tamoxifen, \nlithium, and heroin, can cause nephrotic syndrome. \nB. Clinical consequences \n1. Primary sodium retention by the kidney, related to \nloeffective circulating volume, causes edema and \nhypertension. \n2. Albumin excretion leads to hypoalbuminemia, which also \ncontributes to edema formation. \n3. Alterations in lipoprotein production and catabolism lead \nto elevations of low-density lipoprotein and sometimes \ntriglycerides. \n4. Immunoglobulin excretion and depression ofT cdl \nfunction causes increased susceptibility to infection. \n5. Thromboembolic complications \na. Due to increased procoagulatory factors and fibrinogen, \naltered fibrinolytic system, urinary loss of antithrombin III, \nand increased platdet activity \nb. Relative risk of DVf is 1. 7 with an annual incidence \nof 1.5%; the annual incidence of renal vein thrombosis \nis 0.5%. \nc. Relative risk of pulmonary embolism is 1.4 bur is \n6.8 for patients aged 18-39 years. \nd. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism include \nserum albumin< 2.0-2.5 mg/dL, protein excretion \n> 8 g/24 h, and being within 6 months of diagnosis of \nnephrotic syndrome. \ne. The role of prophylactic anticoagulation is unclear but \nshould be considered in high-risk patients. \nf. Arterial thrombosis is rare. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Nephrotic syndrome is defined by the presence of urinary \nprotein excretion of at least 3.5 g/24 hours, measured with \neither a 24-hour specimen or a spot albumin/creatinine ratio \n> 3000-3500 mcg/mg. \nB. Laboratory evaluation should include \n1. CBC \n2. Comprehensive metabolic panel (kidney and liver function, \nincluding serum albumin} \n3. PT/INR, PTT \n4. Fasting glucose and HbA10 \n5. Antinuclear antibody \n6. HN \n7. Hepatitis B serology (surface antigen, core antibody) \n8. Hepatitis C antibody \n9. Serum and urine protein dectrophoresis \nC. Renal ultrasound, particularly if the glomerular filtration rate \nis reduced \nD. Renal biopsy is often necessary. \n\nTreatment \nA. All patients with nephrotic syndrome should be referred to a \nnephrologist. \nB. Loop diuretics are used to treat the edema; high doses are \noften needed due to the primary sodium retention by the \nkidney. \nC. Angiotensin-convening enzyme inhibitors reduce proteinuria \nin both hypenensive and normotensive patients. \n1. The antiproteinuric effect becomes maximal in 28 days. \n2. The effect can be increased by a low-salt diet, diuretic \ntreatment, or both. \nD. There is currently no evidence to support initiating \nlipid-lowering therapy for treating hyperlipidemia \nassociated with nephrotic syndrome. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs.Eisa 62-year-old woman with a long history of hyper-\ntension that is well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, \nmetoprolol, and amlodlplne.

Mrs. E's long-standing history of hyper-\ntension raises the possibility of diastolic dysfunction, and the lack \nof physical exam findings does not rule this out. While she does \nhave long-standing hypertension, there are no clinical clues to \nsuggest advanced liver or kidney disease; however, these are easy \nto test for and should always be ruled out. Amlodipine commonly \ncauses edema, but she has taken it for years without symptoms. \n\"Dependent edema,\" edema that is worsened by standing and \nEDEMA I 319 \nE. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents are used \nin selected patients. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. V's hepatit is C antibody is positive, with neqative \nhepatitis B serologles. Her total cholesterol 15145 mg/ dL and \nher 24-hour urinary protein excretion ls 1.4 g. An abdominal \nCT scan demonstrates a small, nodular liver; splenomegaly; \nand ascites. You schedule an esophagogastroduodenos-\ncopy to screen for va rices, start spironolactone because of \nthe di5COmfort she is having from the edema, and refer her \nto a hepatologlst. \nimproves or resolves with leg elevation, is consistent with, but not \nspecific for, venous insufficiency. A final consideration would be \npulmonary hypertension. Patients with pulmonary hypenension \ncommonly complain of dyspnca in addition to edema, and the \ntired feeling she experiences with exertion could represent dyspnea. \nAdditionally, she is overweight, putting her at risk for obstructive \nsleep apnea and consequent pulmonary hypenension.

However, the echocardiogram shows the somewhat \nunexpected finding of pulmonary hypertension (PH). This neces-\nsitates revising the original set of diagnostic hypotheses: the leading \nhypothesis is noPH, and venous insufficiency is the remaining \nactive alternative. \nLeading Hypothesis: Pulmonary Hypertension \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients commonly complain of long-standing dyspnea that \nprogresses over months or years. Syncope, exertional chest pain, \nand edema occur with more severe PH and impaired right heart \nfunction. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Definition \n1. The normal mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is \n14mmHg. \n2. Table 17-7 outlines the clinical classification of PH. \n3. PH is defined as a mean PAP <!: 25 mm Hg as assessed by \nright heart catheterb:ation. \nB. Epidemiology \n1. The prevalence of Group 1 PAH is 15 cases/million \n(about 3% of patients with PH); approximatdy one-half \nof these are idiopathic, heritable, or drug related \n2. Left heart disease is the etiology of PH in about 65% \nof cases; up to 83% of patients with HF with preserved \nejection fraction have PH. \n3. Over 50% of patients with advanced chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease have PH, as do 32-39% of patients \nwith interstitial lung disease. \n4. Chronic thromboembolic disease is the etiology in 0.5-2% \nof patients with PH. \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \n1. Initial symptoms are nonspecific and are usually related to \nright ventricular dysfunction, including dyspnea, fatigue, \nweakness, chest pain, and syncope. \n2. Less common symptoms include dry cough and exercise-\ninduced nausea and vomiting. \nB. Physical exam \n1. Characteristic findings include the following: \nTable 17-7.

An accentuated pulmonary component of s2 \nb. A sustained left lower parasternal movement \nc. Increased jugular a and v waves \nd. A tricuspid regurgitation murmur \ne. Ascites \nf. Elevated jugular venous pressure \ng. Edema \n2. Overall, physical exam techniques have limited utility in \ndiagnosing PH. \na. Loud P2 on inspiration: LR+, 1.9; LR-, 0.8 \nb. Among specialists, an S~ heard on inspiration: LR+, 4.7; \nLR-, 0.9 \nC. ECG \n1. Expected findings include right axis deviation, right \nventricular hypenrophy, and P-pulmonale pattern \n(right atrial enlargement). \n2. Not sensitive or specific enough to diagnosis PH \n3. For right ventricular hypertrophy: sensitivity; 55%; \nspecificity, 70%; LR+, 1.83; LR-, 0.64 \nD. Chest film \n1. Expected findings include enlargement of pulmonary \narteries and right ventricular enlargement. \n2. Not sensitive or specific enough to diagnose PH (sensitivity, \n46%; specificity; 63%; LR+, 1.24; LR-, 0.85) \nE. Transthoracic echocardiogram is the best first diagnostic test. \n\n1. Ec:hocardiogram estimates often correlate fairly well with \ninvasively determined P APs, but overestimates of 10 mm Hg \nare common. \n2. Sensitivity ranges from 73% to 90%. \n3. Specificity ranges from 53% to 85%. \nF. Right heart c:atheterization is the gold standard for diagnosing \nPH, and most patients with suspected PH need a right heart \nc:atheterizatlon to confirm the diagnosis. \nTreatment \nA. Depends on underlying etiology \nB. Correct underlying c:ause when possible \n1. For obstructive sleep apnea, administer continuous positive \nairway pressure. \n2. For chronic thromboembolism, begin anticoagulation and \nconsider thromboendarterec:tomy. \n3. For valvular disease, consider valve repair or replacement. \n4. For congenital heart disease, consider surgic:al repair. \n5. For left ventricular dyi;func:tion, optimize medic:al regimen. \nC. Oxygen therapy for patients with hypoxemia (P02 < 60 mm Hg) \nat rest \nD. Most patients require loop diuretics. \nE. Most therapeutic trials of certain drugs such as calcium \nchannel blockers, endothelin receptor antagonists \n(eg, ambrisentan), phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors \n(eg sildenafll), and prostac:yclin analogs (eg, epoprostenol) \nhave been performed in patients with type 1 PAH. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMrs. E has a normal physical exam, ECG, and chest radio-\ngraph. norm a I right ventricu Jar function on echocardiogram, \nand the Isolated finding of moderately elevated PAP seen \non an echocardlogram. The echocardlogram estimate of PAP \nalone ls not specific enough to make the diagnosis of PH, \nand Mrs. E has no other findings supporting the diagnosis \nof PH. Furthermore, Mrs. E's dyspnea is minimal, suggesting \nthat she has neither significant PH nor pulmonary disease. \nYou explain the puzzling finding to Mrs. E. She does not \nwant to undergo a right heart catheterization to verify \nthe PAP. She reports that she Is able to walk a mile every \nmomlng without shortness of breath, and that her edema \nIs most noticeable when she has been on her feet for a long \ntime. \nHave you crossed a diagnostic threshold \nfor the leading hypotheeie, pulmonary \nhYPertenelon? Have you ruled out the actlvs \nalternatfvH1 Do other tests ne&I to be dons \nto exclude the alternative diagnoses? \nAlternative Diagnosis: Venous Insufficiency \nTextbook Presentation \nVenous insufficiency c:an be asymptomatic: or manifested just by \nsmall visible, but nonpalpable veins. In more severe cases, the \npatient has large varicose veins and skin changes ranging from \nEDEMA I 321 \nGreat sephenous vein \nSuperficial femoral vein --~\nDeep fascia \n~ Bloodfto\nLesser saphenous vein \nPeroneal venae comltans \nLateral perforating vein \nFigure 17-4. Anatomy of the superficial venous system. \nedema to fibrosing panniculitis to ulceration. Symptoms include \nleg fullness or heaviness, ac:hing leg pain, and nocturnal leg cramps. \nSymptoms are often worse at the end of the day and in heat, and \nare sometimes rdieved by devation. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Anatomy (Figure 17-4) \n1. The superficial saphenous veins join the deep syi;tem at the \nknee (popliteal vein) and the groin (femoral vein). \n2. Perforating veins directly connect the saphenous veins and \nthe deep veins at various points along their paralld courses. \n3. Valves within the veins prevent reflux back toward the feet. \nB. Pathophysiology and epidemiology \nI. Chronic: venous disease is due to venous hypertension \ncaused by reflux through incompetent valves, venous \noutfloobstruction, or lac:k of c:alf muscle pumping due \nto obesity or immobility. \n2. Varicose veins are found in 14-46% of women and \n11-29% of men. \n3. Prevalence of skin changes is 4-12%; prevalence of skin \nulcers is 1-2%. \n4. Risk factors for venous insufficiency include female sex, \nadvancing age, obesity, a history of phlebitis or venous \nthrombosis, serious leg trauma, pregnancy, prolonged \nstanding, and greater height. \n5. Postthrombotic: syndrome (venous insufficiency after a \nDVT) occurs in 33% of patients within 5 years; long-term \nuse of compression stockings may reduce risk. \nC. Classification of skin changes \n1. Class 1: telangiec:tasias or reticular veins (nonpalpable \nsubdermal veins up to 4 mm in diameter) \n2. Class 2: varicose veins (palpable, subcutaneous veins \n> 4 mm in diameter) \n\n322 I CHAPTER 17 \n3. Class 3: edema without skin changes \na. Initially present just at the end of day but can become \npersistent and massive \nb. Can be unilateral initially \nc. Often begins around medial malleolus \n4. Class 4: skin changes \na. Pigmentation due to breakdown of cxtravasated RBCs \nb. Stasis dermatitis: itching, weeping, scaling, erosions, and \ncrusting \nc. Lipodermatosclerosis or fibrosing panniculitis \n(1) Induration initially at medial ankle, spreading \ncircumferentially round the entire leg, up to \nmid calf \n(2) The skin is heavily pigmented and fixed to \nsubcutaneous tissues, with brawny edema above \nthe fibrosis and in the foot belo\n(3) High risk for cellulitis \n5. Classes 5 and 6: healed or nonhealed ulcers \na. Usually loon the medial ankle or along the path of \nthe long or short saphenous vein \nb. Never above the knee or on the forefoot \nc. Chronic and recurrent, often lasting for months or \neven years \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosis is often made based on the appearance of the leg. \nB. Venography is the gold standard. \nC. Duplex ultrasonography is the best noninvasive test. \n1. Should be done if the diagnosis is in doubt (especially to \nrule out DVT), in patients with atypical symptoms or \npresentations, or if surgery is being considered \n2. For diagnosing valvular incompetence, the sensitivity is \n84%, specificity is 88%, LR+ = 7, and LR- = 0.18. \n3. For diagnosing severe venous insufficiency, the sensitivity is \n77%, specificity is 85%, LR+ = 5.1, and LR- = 0.26. \nD. Because many patients have both arterial and venous insuffi-\nciency, concurrent arterial disease must be ruled out with the \nankle-brachial index. \nTreatment \nA. Compression stockings are the most important treatment \nmodality. \n1. Have been shown to reduce the risk of postthrombotic \nsyndrome, to accelerate ulcer healing, and to prevent \nrecurrent ulceration \n2. Classified into several grades, based on degree of \ncompression at the ankle \na. 20-30 mm Hg: for patients with varicose veins, edema, \nleg fatigue (Classes 2 and 3) \nb. 30-40 mm Hg: for patients with severe varicosities or \nmoderate disease (Classes 4-6) \nc. 40-50 mm Hg: for patients with recurrent ulceration \n3. Knee high stockings are better tolerated than thigh high \nstockings. \n4. Compliance often poor due to skin irritation, discomfort, \nand difficulty putting on the stockings. \nCompression stockings should not be used in \npatients with peripheral arterial disease or with \ninvasive infection at an ulcer site. \n5. Alternative ways to provide compression include elastic \nwraps and intermittent pneumatic compression pumps. \n6. Ulcers should be covered with a dressing before putting \non the compression device. \nB. Diuretics are ineffective for the edema unless given with \ncompression therapy. \nC. Treatment of venous insufficiency ulcers \n1. Occlusive dressing \n2. Leg elevation and compression \n3. Aspirin, 325 mg daily, might accelerate healing. \n4. Pentoxifylline might accelerate healing. \n5. Topical antibiotics have no role. \n6. Systemic antibiotics indicated only if cellulitis or other \ninvasive infection is present. \nD. Interventional therapies \n1. Sclerotherapy for spider veins, venous lakes, varicose veins \n1-4 mm in diameter \n2. Endovenous radiofrequency ablation and laser: alternative \nto vein stripping for great saphenous vein reflux \n3. Iliac vein stenting for venous outfloabnormalities \n4. Vein stripping and ligation \na. Usually involves removing the saphenous vein with high \nligation of the saphenofemoral junction \nb. Shown to result in significant improvement in \nsymptoms in patients with Class 2-6 disease \nc. Surgery plus compression is better than compression \nalone for preventing ulcer recurrence (12% combined \ntherapy vs. 28% compression alone). \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nYou decide t hat Mrs. E's e;ymptome; are more cone;le;tent \nwith venous insufficiency than with PH. Duplex ultrasono-\ngraphic scane; confirm valvular incompetence, and you \nrecommend that Mrs. E wear compression stockings.

She was treated with \nadjuvant radiation therapY and has l:leen taking tamoxlfen \nsince completlng the radiation. She has had no evidence of \nrecurrent disease l:lut has had some right arm swelllng for \nat least 18 months. She comes to see you nol:lecause \n2 days ago the swelling of her right arm worsened, with \nassociated pain and redness.

Exploring her history, it is notable that she has chronic \nlymphedema due to disruption of lymphatic drainage by her pro-\nvious surgery and radiation therapy. This is an imponant clinical \nclue, since patients with lymphatic disruption and lymphedema are \nat high risk for skin and subcutaneous infections. Pathophysiolog-\nically, the edema found in cellulitis is due to a localized increase in \ncapillary permeability due to inflammation; however, patients with \nunderlying limb abnormalities will ofi:en present with more diffuse \nedema. The other primary consideration in any patient with uni-\nlateral limb swelling is DVf. Mrs. K has several risk fuctors for this, \nincluding history of cancer, possible venous scarring secondary to \nradiation, and use of tamoxifen (a drug associated with a relative \nrisk for DVf of about 3). Table 17-8 lists the differential diagnosis. \n~ \nAlways think about DVf in a patient with \ny \nunilateral limb swelling. \nTable 17-8.

Breast cancer treatment \n(1) Cellulitis of the ipsilateral arm is seen in women \nin whom lymphedema of the arm develops after \nmastectomy. \n(2) Cellulitis of the ipsilateral breast is seen in women \nin whom localized lymphedema develops after \nlumpectomy, axillary node dissection, and radiation \ntherapy. \n2. An entry site for infection can be identified in 77% of \ncases. \na. Half are due to tinea pedis \nb. Other sites include leg ulcers, trauma, eczema, and \nsubcut.aneous abscess \n3. Clinical presentation \na. Presence of systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills, \nmyalgias) is unusual and suggests concomitant \nbacteremia or a more serious infection such as \nnecrotizing fasciitis. \nb. Physical findings \n(1) Nonpalpable, confluent erythema with indistinct \nmargins \n(2) Generalized swelling \n(3) Warmth and tenderness of involved skin \n\n324 I CHAPTER 17 \n(4) Tender regional adenopathy sometimes found \n(5) Lymphangitls and abscess formatlon sometimes seen \n(6) In women who have been treated for breast cancer \nand have arm lymphedema, the humeral area of the \nipsilateral extremity is most often involved, with \nextension to the shoulder and forearm. \n(7) In breast cellulitls, the infection starts at the \nlumpectomy site and can extend to the remainder \nof the breast, the anterior shoulder, back, and \nipsilateral upper extremity. \n4. Microbiology \na. Beta-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aumu \nare the most common organisms; S aumu is the more \nlikely cause if there is an abscess or drainage, and \nstreptococci are more likely if there is no abscess or \ndrainage. \n(1) Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aumu \n(CA-MRSA), usually the USA300 genotype, is \nincreasingly common; it is nothe most common \npathogen cultured from skin and soft tissue \ninfections in urban emergency departments. \n(2) Risk factors for MRSA \n(a) Recent antibiotlc use \n(b) Recent hospitalization or resident of a long-term \ncare facility \n(c) Recurrent needle stlcks (injection drug use, \nhemodialysis, insulin use) \n(d) Homelessness, incarceration \n(e) Contact sports \n(f) Patients with a previous CA-MRSA infection or \ncolonizatlon \n(3) Many patients with CA-MRSA have none of these \nrisk factors \n(4) Skin abscesses, often with central necrosis, are a \nvery common manifestation of CA-MRSA; patients \noften think they have been bitten by a spider or \nother insect. \n(5) Other manifestations include necrotizing \npneumonia, pleural empyema, necrotizing \nfasciitis, septic thrombophlebitis, myositis, \nand severe sepsis. \nb.

Streptococci are the causative organisms in 75% of \ncases; group A accounts for about 46% of these cases. \nb. S aumu is also found in 14% of cases \nConsider necrotizing fasditis in patients with \na rapid increase in the size of the infected area, \nevolution of violaceous bullae, a reddish-purple \ndiscoloration of the skin, woody induration of \nthe infected area, disproportionally severe pain \nor tenderness, and/or severe systemic toxicity. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Both cellulitis and erysipelas are clinical diagnoses. \nB. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Guidelines \nrecommend against routine blood cultures, skin surface swab \ncultures, or biopsy cultures \n1. Blood cultures are positive in :S: 5% of patients \n\n2. Skin biopsy cultures are positive S 5 to 40% of patients \n3. Skin surface swab cultures, particularly those of c:hronic \nwounds, are often polymicrobial, not involved in the \netiology of the cellulitis, and can lead to unnecessarily \nbroad antibiotic therapy. \nC. If there is a skin abscess associated with the cellulitis, it should \nbe drained and the fluid cultured. \n1. Clinical assessment for identifying drainable abscess: \nsensitivity, 75-90%; specificity, 55-83%; LR+, 2.7; \nLR-, 0.25. \n2. In uncenain instances, ultrasound can improve diagnosis: \nsensitivity, 89-98%; specificity, 64-88%; LR+, 3.5; \nLR-, 0.09. \nD. CT or MRI should be done if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected; \nMRI is more sensitive, but CT is more specific. \nTreatment \nCultures are rarely helpful in cellulitis or \nerysipelas without an associated abscess. \nA. Cellulitis (Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines) \n1. Outpatients with purulent cellulitis (associated with \npurulent drainage or exudate but no drainable abscess}: \nempiric treatment for CA-MRSA with trimethoprim-\nsulfamethoxawle (TMP-SMX) or doxycycline for 5 days \na. If infection has not improved at 5 days, treatment \nshould be extended. \nb. If no risk factors for MRSA exist, empiric treatment \nfor methicillin-sensitive S aurtUS with dicloxacillin or \ncephalexin is reasonable. \n2. Outpatients with nonpurulent cellulitis (no exudate or \ndrainage; no abscess}: empiric treatment for beta-hemolytic \nstreptococci with a beta-lactam (cephalexin, amoxicillin, or \nsimilar drugs) for 5 days \na. Patients who do not respond should be treated for \nCA-MRSA \nb. To treat for both CA-MRSA and beta-hemolytic \nstreptococci, use clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or \ndoxycycline and a beta-lactam or linezolid. \n3. 10-20% ofMRSA isolates that are sensitive to \nclindamycin, bur resistant to erythromycin, develop \ninducible clindamycin resistance due to the presence of \nthe mn gene. \n4. Clindamycin sensitive/erythromycin resistant isolates \nshould undergo the \"D-Zone Test\" to look for inducible \nresistance (Figure 17-5). \nB. Erysipelas \n1. Penicillin G or amoxicillin is effective in > 80% of patients \nwith erysipelas. \n2. Other drugs that have been studied include macrolides and \nfluoroquinolones. \n3. Should treat for 5 days; should extend for longer if no \nimprovement \nC. Uncomplicated, slowly progressive infection in a wdl-\nappearing patient can be treated with oral antibiotics if \n1. The patient has no GI upset \n2. The limb can be elevated \n3. Serial exams are feasible \nSaureus \ngrowth \nErythromycin \nEDEMA I 325 \nNo Saureus \ngrowth \nClindamycin \nWhen there is inducible clindarnycin resistance, the zone \nof clindamycin inhibition is blunted on the side next to \nthe erythromycin disk, resulting in a \"D\" shaped area of no \ngrowth surrounding the clindamycin disk.

Classification \n1. Primary UEDVT (20% of cases) \na. Effort-related thrombosis, also known as Paget-\nSchroetter syndrome (two-thirds of primary \nUEDVT cases) \n(1) Due to microtrauma to the subclavian vein from \nrepetitive arm movements during overhead activities \nor vigorous exercise; usually occurs in young males. \n(2) Abnormalities of the costoclavicular junction may \nbe present \nb. Venous thoracic outlet syndrome: compression of the \nsubclavian vein due to abnormalities of one or more \nstructures at the costoclavicular junction \nc. Idiopathic \n2. Secondary UEDVT (80% of cases); risk factors are shown \nin Table 17-10 \na. Indwelling central venous catheter-associated UEDVT \n(up to 70% of cases) \n(1) UEDVT occurs more often with large catheters \nthan with smaller ones. \n(2) Risk increases with duration of catheter use, being \nnegligible within 6 days and increasing significantly \nafter 2 weeks. \n(3) Risk is higher with polyvinyl chloride-coated \ncatheters than with silicone ones. \n(4) One study found that the risk is about 2.5 times \nhigher with peripherally inserted central catheters \nthan with other central venous catheters. \nb. Malignancy(> 40% of cases): patients with cancer and \nan indwdling catheter are at especially high risk. \nc. Hypercoagulable states \nd. Other miscellaneous causes (surgery, infection, \nimmobility, concurrent lower extremity DVT) \nB. Sites \n1. Subclavian (74%) and axillary (38%) most common \n2. Multiple veins are often involved, but bilateral UEDVT is \nrare. \nTable 17-10. Risk factors for upper extremity deep venous \nthrombosis. \nRisk Factor \nCancer plus central venous catheter (CVQ \nAdjust Odds Ratio \n(95%CI) \n43.6 (25.5-74.6) \nO/C plus Inherited coagulation disorder \n-30 \nCancer \n18.1 (9.4-35.1) \nOral contraceptives plus factor V Leiden or \n13.6 (2.7-f:J7 .3) \nprothrombln G20210A mutation \n-------------\n------------------------ \nUpper extremity surgery \n13.1 (2.1--80.6) \nMetastatic vs. localized cancer \n115 (1.6--80.2) \nIndwelling CVC \n9.7 (7.8--12.2) \nUpper extremity plaster cast \n7.0 (1.7-295) \nC. Clinical features \n1. Pain is present in ~40% of patients. \n2. Edema is present r80% of patients in some series, but \npatients with catheter-related UEDVT often do not have \nedema. \n3. Patients may note numbness, heaviness, paresthesias, \npruritus, and coldness. \n4. Dilated cutaneous veins sometimes visible. \nD. Complications \n1. Pulmonary embolism has been reported to occur in up \nto 36% of cases and is more often seen with secondary \nUEDVT, especially catheter-related \na. More recent studies have found a much lower rate of \npulmonary embolism, with symptomatic pulmonary \nembolism reported r9%. \nb. Risk of pulmonary embolism due to UEDVT is lower \nthan with lower extremity DVT \n~ \nUEDVf an a= pulmo=y=bol;,m. \n2. Recurrent thrombosis occurs in up to 2-13% of patients. \n3. Postthrombotic syndrome is seen in up to 7--46% of \npatients in different series. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Venography is the gold standard. \nB. Duplex ultrasonography is the most commonly used noninva-\nsive test. \n1. Disadvantages include a blind spot caused by the clavicle, \ninability to determine compressibility in veins located in \nthe thoracic cavity, and difficulties interpreting the study if \nthere are collateral veins. \n2. Sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 96%; LR+, 24.3; LR-, 0.03 \nC. The test characteristics of D-dimer alone for the diagnosis of \nUEDVT are not known. \nD. Magnetic resonance and CT venography are sometimes done; \nsensitivity and specificity are unknown. \nE. The American College of Chest Phyi;icians Guidelines recom-\nmend the following diagnostic approach: \n1. Initial evaluation with duplex ultrasound \n2. Follow-up testing with a highly sensitive D-dimer or \nvenography (CT, MR, or conventional) in patients with a \nnormal ultrasound and a high clinical suspicion. \n3. No further testing in patients with negative follow-up testing \nTreatment \nA. Anticoagulation with heparin or heparin analogs, followed by \nat least 3 months of warfarin; patients with cancer or chronic \nindwelling central venous catheters should receive anticoagula-\ntion therapy indefinitely. \nB. Thrombolysis with or without stent placement is sometimes \ndone, especially in patients who require permanent indwelling \ncatheters. \nC. Limited evidence exists for the use of direct oral anticoagu-\nlants in patients with UEDVT. \n\nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. K's presentation of a sharply demarcatea. erythema-\ntous plaque. fever. and leulcocytosis is diagnostic of erysi-\npelas.

Weinstein, MD, MPH \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. M ls a 42-year-old woman who has had fatigue for the \npast 6 months. \n~~ \nWhat fs the differential diagnosis of fatigue? \n~JI\"' Howould you frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nBefore considering the differential diagnosis, it is important to \nunderstand what the patient means by fatigue, which is conven-\ntionally defined as a sensation of exhaustion after usual activities, \nor a feeling of insufficient energy to begin usual activities. Most \npeople consider the terms fatigue, tiredness, and lack of energy \nsynonymous. However, patients sometimes use these terms when \nthey are actually experiencing other symptoms, especially excessive \nsleepiness, weakness, or dyspnea on exertion. \nAlways ask patients what they mean when they \nreport fatigue. Always ask directly about weak-\nness, excessive sleepiness, and dyspnea. \nAcute fatigue is common in conjunction with a variety of acute ill-\nnesses, ranging from uncomplicated viral infections to exacerbations \nof heart failure (HF). Fatigue is also a prominent symptom in some \nchronic diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and cancer. This chapter \nwill not discuss fatigue in such patients but will focus on evaluating \nthe symptom of fatigue lasting weeks to months in patients without \nalready diagnosed conditions known to cause fatigue. \nThe differential diagnosis of fatigue is extremely broad and best \norganized with an organ/system approach. \nA. Psychiatric \n1. Depression \n2. Anxiety \n3. Somatization disorder \n4. Substance abuse \nB. Sleep disorders \n1. Insomnia \n2. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) \n3. Periodic leg movements \n4. Narcolepsy \nC. Endocrine \n1. Thyroid disease \n2. Diabetes mellitus \n3. Hypoadrenalism \nD. Medications (Table 18-1) \nE. Hematologic or oncologic \n1. Anemia \n2. Cancer \nF.

Infectious: chronic infections \nL. Rheumatologic: autoimmune diseases \nM. Fatigue of unknown etiology \n1. Chronic fatigue syndrome \n2. Idiopathic chronic fatigue: fatigue for which no medical, \npsychiatric, or sleep pattern explanation can be found. \nFigure 18-1 outlines the diagnostic approach to fatigue. \n\nThe most common causes of fatigue are psychi-\natric disorders, sleep disorders, and medication \nside effects. \nMrs. M reports t hat she Is t ired all the time. beglnnl~ first \nthing In t he morning and lasting all day. She also reports \nfrontal headaches several mornings per week. Intermittent \nlower abdominal pain relieved by bowel movements, and lo\nback pain. She does not complain of any trouble sleeping. \nHer past medical history Is notable for menorrhagia \nand iron deficiency anemia when she was in her 20s and is \notherwise unremarkable. Currently. her menses occur every \n30 days. with bleeding for 3-4 days. Her family history Is \nnotable for thyroid disease In her mother and breast cancer \nIn her paternal grandmother. \nShe takes no medications, does not smoke, and does \nnot drink alcohol. She has never used illicit drugs. She works \nas a teacher, and her husband Is a securit y guard. They have \n2 children. ages 9 and 1 2.

Up to 75% of patients with fatigue have psychi-\natric symptoms. Sleep disorders, especially OSA and insomnia \nsyndromes, are also common in patients with fatigue, and in one \nreferral clinic, 80% of patients with fatigue had sleep disorders. \nBecause the differential diagnosis of fatigue is broad and difficult \nto limit during the initial assessment, it is necessary to explore for \nsymptoms and signs of many possible etiologies in most patients, \neven those with pivotal psychiatric or sleep disorder symptoms. \nPatients with several somatic complaints, such as Mrs. M, are par-\nticularly likdy to have psychiatric causes for fatigue, as are patients \nwho feel tired constantly. Because sleep disorders are so common, \neither in association with psychiatric disorders or alone, they are \nalways an active alternative in patients with fatigue. Patients often \ndo not spontaneously describe sleep disturbances and psychiatric \nsymptoms, so it is important to ask about them directly. \n~ \nAll patients with fatigue need a detailed \nY \npsychosocial and sleep history. \nAlthough most patients with fatigue do not have anemia, hypo-\nthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, these conditions are important \nand treatable, and so are generally considered \"must not miss\" diag-\nnoses. Anemia and hypothyroidism are somewhat likely in Mrs. M \nbecause of her previous history of anemia and her family history of \nthyroid disease. Finally, on occasion, fatigue may be the presenting \nsymptom in patients with undiagnosed cardiac, pulmonary, renal, \nliver, rheumatologic, or chronic infectious disease. Table 18-2 lists \nthe differential diagnosis. \n\nDespite the rarity of positive results, most \npatients with fatigue need basic laboratory \ntesting consisting of a blood count, chemistry \npanel (including glucose, electrolytes, blood \nurea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, calcium, and \nliver biochemical tests), and a thyroid-stimulat-\ning hormone (TSH) test. \nMrs. M does not; lack Interest In her usual activities or feel \ndepressed. She has not lost or gained weight . She worries \nabout money and her family. \nOn physical exam, she appears healthy and her affect Is \nnormal. Her BMI Is 35. HEENT exam Is normal. There ls no \nthyromegaly or adenopathy. Lungs are clear. There are no \nbreast masses. Cardiac and abdominal exams are normal. \nand there is no edema.

Anxiety \nFor discussion on depression, see Chapter 32, Unintentional \nWeight loss. \nAnxiety \nTextbook Presentation \nBetween 70% and 90% of patients with anxiety or depression \ncomplain of somatic symptoms. Many patients complain of fatigue \nor insomnia, but others have symptoms that seem unrelated. Of \nthe patients with unexplained symptoms, 40-50% have an anx-\niety disorder. Other common symptoms include muscle tension, \nheadaches, gastrointestinal complaints, and chest pain or tightness. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Generalized anxiety disorder \n1. Lifetime prevalence: 5-9%, 12-month prevalence: 2-3% \n2. Characterized by excessive or persistent worry on the \nmajority of days for 6 months or longer \nL Associated with at least 3 of the following: \n(1) Easy fu.tigability \n(2) Feeling restless or on edge \n(3) Trouble concentrating \n(4) Irritability \n(5) Muscle tension \n(6) Sleep dismrbance \nb.

Lifetime prevalence: 6.8%, 12-month prevalence: 2.4% \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The GAD-2 (first 2 questions of the GAD-7) and GAD-7 \nquestionnaires are commonly used to screen for and assess \nseverity of anxiety disorders (both questionnaires are available \nfrom a variety of websites). \n1. The GAD-2 score ranges from 0--6. \na. A positive screen is a score of~ 3. \nb. For the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, \n(1) Sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 83% \n(2) LR+, 5.0; LR-, 0.17 \n\nc. The GAD-7 should be completed in patients with a \npositive GAD-2. \n2. The GAD-7 score ranges from 0-21. \na. Scoring: 5-9, mild anxiety; 10-14, moderate anxiety; \n15-21, severe anxiety \nb. For the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, using a \ncut off of2 5 \n(1) Sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 57% \n(2) LR+, 2.2; LR-, 0.05 \nc. Using a cut-off of<!: 10, \n(1) Sensitivity, 89%; specificity, 0.82% \n(2) LR+, 5.1; LR-, 0.13 \nd. A GAD-7 score < 5 also reduces the probability the \npatient has \n(1) Social anxiety disorder (sensitivity 88%, LR-, 0.21) \n(2) Panic disorder (sensitivity 94%, LR-, 0.11) \nTreatment \nEffective first-line treatment includes cognitive behavioral ther-\napy (CBT) and pharmacologic therapy with selective serotonin \nreuptakt: inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, \ntricyclic antidepressants, buspirone, or benzodiazepines. \n\nMrs. M has never had a panic attack and does not consider \nherself excessively nervous or anxious. Her GAD-2 score is 0. \nShe does not meet the criteria for anxiety or depression. It Is, \ntherefore, necessary to consider the alternative diagnoses. \nMrs. M works as a teacher, rising at 6 AM, leaving her \nhouse at 7 AM. and returning home about 5 PM. She then \nprepares dlnnerfor her family, helps her 2 children with their \nhomework, and grades papers untll 9:30 PM. She watches a \nlittle television, and then goes to sleep at about 1 0:00 PM. \nHer husband works from 3 PM to 11 PM, and she often \nwakes up when he gets home at midnight. He needs some \ntime to \"wind down before he goes to sleep. so they often \ntalk and watch 1V In bed for an hour or so. After her hus-\nuand dozes off. she often cannot fall back asleep, and will \nsit in bed \"surfing\" the Internet on her phone for an hour or \ntwo. She also comments that she feels tired even when she \nsleeps straight through the night on the weekends, and her \nhusband complains about her snoring. \n~~ le the cllnical information eufflclent ta maka a \n~Jiii\"' dlagnoele? If not, what other Information do \nyou 1111Sed? \nMrs. M's sleep history clearly uncovers several sleep hygiene \nissues. However, she is also obese, a risk factor for OSA. Re-exploring \nher symptoms, it is notable that she has several other risk factors for \nOSA including morning headaches, feeling fatigued even when she \nsleeps all night, and snoring. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nRevised Leading Hypothesis: Insomnia \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with insomnia sometimes have trouble falling asleep, \nsometimes fall asleep easily but wake up during the night, and \nsometimes have both problems. The American Sleep Disorder \nFATIGUE I 333 \nAssociation defines insomnia as \"a repeated difficulty with sleep \ninitiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite \nadequate time and opponunity for sleep and results in some form \nof daytime impairment and lasting for at least one month.\" \nDisease Highlights \nA. Primary insomnia \nI. Pathogenesis is unknown but may be due to a state of \nhyperarousal. \n2. Prevalence of2-4% in the adult population \nB. Secondary (comorbid) insomnia \nI. Intrinsic sleep disorders \na. OSA or central sleep apnea \nb. Restless leg syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder \n2. Extrinsic sleep disorders \na. Psychophysiologic insomnia: due to conditioned arousal \nwhen in the bedroom \nb. Inadequate sleep hygiene or environmental sleep disorders \n(due to specific environmental elements) \nc. Related to alcohol or other substance use (stimulants, \nwithdrawal from hypnotic drugs) \n3. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders \na. Shift work disorder \nb. Delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome (major \nsleep phase several hours later or earlier compared to \nconventional sleep times) \nc. Tune zone change syndrome Qet lag) \n4. Related to medical conditions (chronic pain; nocturia; \nuncontrolled HF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/ \nasthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease) \nC. 35-50% of adults have insomnia symptoms; 12-20% have \ninsomnia disorders \nD. Risk factors for insomnia include the following: \nI. Depression \n2. Female sex \n3. Older age \n4. Lower socioeconomic status \n5. Concurrent medical and mental disorders \n6. Marital status (divorced/separated more often than married) \n7. Race (blacks more often than whites) \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Obtaining a thorough history helps establish the diagnosis \nof insomnia. Ask about predisposing, precipitating, and \nperpetuating factors. Initial screening questions include the \nfollowing: \nI. Difficulty initiating sleep, staying asleep, or both? \n2. Early awakening? \n3. Nonrestorative sleep? \n4. Daytime consequences? (Lack of daytime fatigue or sleepiness \nsuggests the insomnia is not clinically significant.) \n5. Frequency and duration? \nB. Follow-up questions \nI. Precipitating events, progression, ameliorating or \nexacerbating factors? \n2. Sleep-wake schedule? \n\n334 I CHAPTER 18 \n3. Cognitive attitude toward sleep? \na. Negative expectations regarding the ability to sleep \nand distortions about the effects of insomnia lead to \nperpetuation of the insomnia. \nb. Attitudes toward previous treatments are also important. \n4. Psychiatric disorder present? \n5. Substance misuse or medication use? \n6. Medical illness with nocturnal symptoms? \n7. Symptoms of sleep apnea, restless legs? (See discussion below.) \nTreatment \nA. CBT addresses dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors about sleep \nand is considered first-line treatment for all patients with \ninsomnia. When compared to pharmacologic therapy, CBT \nhas a similar effect but is better sustained. CBT includes the \nfollowing components: \n1. Stimulus control \na. Also known as sleep hygiene \nb. Based on premise that insomnia is a conditioned \nresponse to temporal and environmental cues \nc. Has been shown to be effective for sleep onset and \nmaintenance \nd. Principles of sleep hygiene \n(1) Go to bed only when sleepy. \n(2) Use the bedroom only for sleep and sex, not reading, \nwatching television, eating, working, or using a \ncomputer \n(3) If unable to sleep after 20 minutes in bed, get out \nof bed, go into another room, read or listen to quiet \nmusic, and then return to bed when sleepy. \n(4) Maintain a consistent sleep-wake schedule; go to \nbed and get up at the same time each day. \n(S) Avoid daytime napping; if napping is necessary, \nlimit the nap to less than 30 minutes and take the \nnap no later than the early afternoon. \n(6) Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and other stimulants (such \nas decongestants). \n(7) Exercise regularly but not in the late evening. \n2. Relaxation therapy \na. Methods include progressive muscle relaxation, \nbiofeedback to reduce somatic arousal, imagery training, \nand meditation. \nb. Useful for both sleep onset and maintenance \nc. Often requires practice with a trained professional \n3. Sleep restriction \na. Decreases the amount of time spent in bed in order to \nincrease the percentage of time in bed spent sleeping \nb. Usually keep waking time constant and make bedtime \nlater, with progressive moving up of bedtime as sleep \nimproves \nc. Effective for sleep onset and maintenance \n4, Cognitive therapy involves identifying dysfunctional beliefs \nabout sleep and then substituting more functional attitudes \nthat can reduce anxiety. \nB. Pharmacotherapy \n1. Most studies of pharmacologic agents are short \n(12 days to 6 months}, so data about long-term effects \nare lacking. \n2. Basic principles for using pharmacotherapy to treat chronic \ninsomnia \na. Use agents with shorter half-lives to minimize daytime \nsedation. \nb. Use the lowest effective dose. \nc. Try to dose intermittently, such as 2-4 times per week, \nrather than daily. \nd. Use for the minimum duration possible and try to limit \ndaily use to a maximum of 3-4 weeks. \ne. Discontinue medication gradually. \nf. Monitor for rebound insomnia when medications are \nstopped. \ng. Side effects, including delirium, are more likely to occur \nin elderly patients. \nh. Commonly used sleep aids are summarized in Table 18-3. \nC. Pharmacologic therapy versus CBT \n1. Data comparing pharmacotherapy with CBT are limited. \na. Overall, treatment effects of CBT, pharmacotherapy, \nand combined therapy are similar. \nb. More sustained improvement with CBT long-term. \nc. More adverse effects with pharmacotherapy. \nd. Lack of evidence to support the use of combined \ntherapy routinely. \ne. Many patients will improve with CBT without the use \nof medication. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Obstructive Sleep Apnea \nTatbook Presentation \nPatients with OSA often complain of daytime sleepiness or fatigue. \nBed partners often note snoring or actual apneic episodes. Most \npatients are obese. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Characterized by repetitive episodes of complete or partial \nupper airway obstruction during sleep that results in desatura-\ntion in oxyhemoglobin and sleep fragmentation. \n1. An obstructive apnea is at least 10 seconds of cessation of \nventilation accompanied by respiratory efforts. \n2. A hypopnea is at least a 30% reduction in airflofor \n10 seconds or longer with at least a 4% reduction in oxygen \nsaturation. \n3. A respiratory effort related arousal is an occurrence of \ndisordered breathing that does not meet criteria for apnea \nor hypopnea but does cause arousal. \n4. The apnea~hypopnea index (AHi) is the total number \nof apneas plus hypopneas per hour; the respiratory \ndisturbance index (RDI) includes apneas, hypopneas, and \nrespiratory effort related arousals. \na. OSA is defined as an AHi or RDI ~ 5 with daytime \nsomnolence, or an AHi or RDI ~ 15 regardless of \nsymptoms. \nb. Mild OSA is an AHi or RDI of 5-14; moderate is an \nAHi or RDI of 15-29, and severe is an AHi or RDI ~30. \nB. Prevalence of OSA \n1. When OSA is defined as an AHi ~ 5 with symptoms or \nan AHi O? 15, the prevalence is 15% in men and 5% in \nwomen. \n2. The prevalence is 50% in referral populations. \n\nTable 18-3.

Pathophysiology \n1. There are normal decreases in tonic pharyngeal muscle \ntone and compensatory reflex dilators during sleep. \n2. Patients with OSA have smaller upper airways due \nto increased parapharyngeal fat, tongue prominence, \ndongated palate, or thickened lateral pharyngeal walls, \nand are unable to maintain airway stability. \n3. During inspiration, the negative upper airway pressures \nclose these narrowed airways, resulting in apneas or \nhypopneas. \nD. Risk factors \n1. Obesity \na. The strongest risk factor for OSA \nb. There is a 6-fold increase in the risk of OSA with a 10% \nweight gain. \nc. Enlarged neck circumference, a measurement of upper \nbody obesity, is a predictor of OSA (> 16 inches in \nwomen, >17 inches in men). \n2. Sex: OSA is 2-3 times more common in men than women. \nTreatment of circadian \nrhythm disorders \nOver the counter product quality \nunclear \n3. Menopausal status: 4-fold increase in risk in postmenopausal \ncompared to prcmenopausal women. \n4. Craniofacial morphology, especially short mandibular length, \nmay explain the presence of OSA in otherwise low-risk patients. \nE. Consequences ofOSA \n1. Increased rate of motor vehicle accidents (relative risk = 2.5-5) \n2. Hypertension (relative risk = 2.89) \n3. HF {relative risk = 2.38) \n4. Higher rates of mortality and adverse cardiac events in \npatients with coronary artery disease and untreated OSA. \n5. An association with impaired glucose tolerance has been \nobserved. \n6. Long-standing, severe OSA can lead to cor pulmonale. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam \n1. Excessive daytime sleepiness is reported by about 35-40% \nof patients with OSA and by about 18% of patients \n\n336 I CHAPTER 18 \nwithout sleep-disordered breathing. Sleepiness can be \nassessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and patients \nwith a score > 10 should be tested for OSA. \n2. Lack of energy, tiredness, or fatigue is reponed by about \n60% of patients with OSA. \n3. Depressive symptoms occur in up to 50% of OSA patients. \n4. Cognitive impairment, especially in executive function and \nsome memory functions, can occur. \n5. Individual clinical symptoms are not very useful in identifying \npatients with OSA. \na. Nocturnal choking/gasping has the best LR+ (3.3), with \nmorning headache having an LR + of 2.6. \nb. The symptoms reported apnea, excessive daytime \nsleepiness, and snoring all have LR+ of< 1.5. \nc. The absence of snoring has an LR- ranging from 0.12 to \n0.45; all other individual symptoms have an LR- near 1. \n6. Several clinical decision rules have been developed to identify \npatients at high risk for OSA, but none is recommended \nfor widespread use due to suboptimal or inconsistent test \ncharacteristics. \na. The Berlin questionnaire and STOP-Bang screening \ntest are the most common and are somewhat useful in \nreducing the likelihood a patient has OSA; none of them \nsignificantly increases the likelihood a patient has OSA. \nb. Berlin Questionnaire (10 questions about snoring, \nobserved apneas, sleepiness, BP, body mass index [BMI]) \n(1) For AHi > 5: sensitivity, 37.2%; specificity, 84%; \nLR+, 2.3; LR-, 0.8 \n(2) For AHi > 15: sensitivity, 43%; specificity, 79.7%; \nLR+, 2.1; LR-, 0.7 \nc. STOP-Bang (snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, BP \n[treated for hypertension]), BMI ~ 35 kg/m2, age> 50 \nyears, neck circumference> 40 cm, sex (male)]; studied \nin preoperative patients; 1 point for each positive \nanswer; normal < 3 \n(1) For AHi > 5: sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 40.3%; \nLR+, 1.4; LR-, 0.4 \n(2) For AHi > 15: sensitivity, 68.4%; specificity, 10.8% \n(3) Scores ~ 6 have specificities > 90%, and the odds of \nhaving OSA increase for scores > 5. \n7. Physical exam findings \na. Elevated blood pressure: approximately 50% of patients \nhave hypertension and the majority of patients with \nresistant hypertension have OSA. \nb. Presence of obesity \nc. Signs of upper airway narrowing \n(1) Enlarged neck circumference \n(2) Macroglossia \n(3) Tonsillar hypertrophy \n(4) Enlarged or elongated uvula \n(5) Signs of nasal obstruction \n(6) Modified Mallampati grade of 3 or 4 (in a sitting \nposition with mouth open and tongue protruded: \nonly soft palate and base of uvula visible [grade 3] \nor only hard palate visible [grade 4]) \nB. Polysomnography \nl. Records electroencephalogram, electromyelogram, ECG, \nheart rate, respiratory effort, airflow, and oxygen saruration \nduring sleep \n2. Gold standard for diagnosis of OSA \n3. One srudy found a sensitivity of 66% for the first night \nsrudy in patients who underwent 2 consecutive night studies; \nthe sensitivity increased by 25% after the second night. \n4. The more severe the OSA, the less variability in the night-\nto-night polysomnogram results. \nTreatment \nA. Risk factor modification \nl. Weight loss, smoking cessation, and avoiding alcohol or \nhypnotics before bedtime should be encouraged in all patients. \n2. A 10% weight loss leads to a 25-30% reduction in \nthe AHL \nB. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is recommended \nas first-line therapy. \nI. Pneumatically splints the upper airway throughout the \nrespiratory cycle \n2. The pressure must be determined during polysomnography \n(a \"CPAP titration\") and is set to eliminate, or at least \nreduce, apneas and hypopneas. \n3. CPAP has been shown to reduce symptoms of sleepiness/ \nfatigue and slightly lower BP; observational studies \nsuggest better cardiovascular outcomes in treated patients \ncompared to untreated patients. \n4, There is no evidence of benefit in patients without daytime \nsleepiness. \nC. Oral appliances \nl. Designed to advance the mandible, pulling the tongue \nforward and opening the pharyngeal airway \n2. Less effective than CPAP \n3. Indicated in patients with mild to moderate OSA who \nprefer an oral appliance or do not respond to positive \nairway pressure therapy \nD. Nasal therapies (external dilator strips, internal nasal dilators, \nlubricants) \nl. Data are limited. \n2. Generally not sufficient treatment \nE. Surgery \nl. Considered second-line therapy unless there are specific, \ncorrectible anatomic abnormalities. \n2. Data on outcomes are limited; maxillary and mandibular \nadvancement procedures can result in improvement similar \nto that seen with CPAP. \n3. Tracheotomy is reserved for patients with severe OSA and \nsevere comorbidities (such as pulmonary hypertension or \nheart failure) who do not respond to other treatments. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. M Is reassured that her laboratory tests are normal. \nA polysom nogram shows an AH I of 2 when she sleeps on her \nside, and an AHi of 15 when she is on her 1:7ack. After listen-\ning to you explain the principles of sleep hygiene, she decides \nto talk with her husl:7and al:7out ways they could spend t ime \ntoflether without Interrupting her sleep so often. Since she \nhas an elevated AHJ only when she Is supine, you recommend \n\nthat she wear a backpack or use special pillows to help her \nstay on her side during sleep. \nWhen she retums 6 months later, she reports that she \nIs still somewhat tired because she values the time she \nspends with her husband at night. However, she noasks \nhim to sleep In the guest room when she feels exception-\nally fatigued, so she can have a fenights of uninterrupted \nsleep. She is successfully using a body pmoto stay on \nher side at night and feels that these interventions have \nreduced her fatigue. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nPeriodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) \nTatbook Presentation \nThe patient complains of daytime sleepiness or fatigue, and the \nbed partner complains that the patient is very restless, even kicking \nthe bed partner. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Periodic episodes of repetitive and stereotyped limb movements \noccurring during non-REM sleep, generally consisting of big toe \nextension in combination with partial fl.exion of the ankle, knee, \nand hip. \nB. The movements recur at regular intervals of 20-40 seconds \nand cause arousal, although the patient is usually unaware. \nC. Rare in persons younger than 30 years; found in 5% of per-\nsons aged 30-50; in 33% of persons aged 50--65; and in 44% \nof persons older than 65 years. \nD. Primary cause of insomnia in 17% of patients \nE. Can be unmasked after successful treatment of OSA \nF. Accompanied by restless leg syndrome (RLS) in 25% of patients \n1. Diagnostic criteria for RLS \na. The urge to move the legs, accompanied by \nuncomfortable or unpleasant sensations, often described \nas \"creeping\" or \"crawling\" \nb. Worsening of symptoms when inactive \nc. Partial symptom rdief with movement \nd. Presence of symptoms only in the evening or at night, \nor worsening of daytime symptoms in the evening \n2. Found in 2-15% of the general population, and 10--35% \nof patients over 65 \n3. Accompanied by PLMD in 85% of cases \n4. Can be primary or secondary to iron deficiency anemia, \nchronic kidney disease, or peripheral neuropathy; possibly \nrelated to celiac disease; all patients with PLMD should \nhave a serum ferritin test done. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. PLMD is confirmed by polysomnography. \nB. RLS is a clinical diagnosis. \nTreatment of PLMD \nEffective medications include dopamine agonists {pramipexole or \nropinirole} and anti-epileptics {such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or \ncarbamazepine}. \nHypothyroidism \nTatbook Presentation \nFATIGUE I 337 \nPatients with hypothytoidism commonly complain of fatigue, con-\nstipation, or cold intolerance. \nDisease Highlights \nThis discussion focuses on primary hypothyroidism in nonpreg-\nnant adults. \nA. Epidemiology \n1. Prevalence of overt hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with lo\nfreeT.) is 0.1% in men and 1-2% in women (see belofor \na discussion of subclinical hypothyroidism). \n2. Prevalence increases with age. \n3. 10 times more common in women than men \n4. More common in patients with other autoimmune diseases. \nB. Etiology \n1. Primary hypothyroidism: failure of the thyroid gland to \nproduce adequate thyroid hormone \na. Most common cause in iodine sufficient areas is chronic \nautoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis \n(1) Both cdl-mediated and antibody-mediated \ndestruction of the thyroid gland \n(2) Autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase, \nthyroglobulin, and TSH receptor \n(3) Patients may or may not have a goiter on \npresentation. \nb. Iodine deficiency is a common cause worldwide; \npatients have large goiters. \nc. Thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy both cause \nhypothyroidism. \n(1) Patients with partial thytoidectomy may not need \nreplacement but should be monitored annually; \nhypothyroidism will devdop in 20%. \n(2) Postablative hypothyroidism develops several weeks \nafter the radioactive iodine therapy in about 80% \nof patients. \nd. Can devdop years later in patients who have undergone \nexternal neck radiation \ne. Amiodarone (14% of patients) and lithium {6% of \npatients) commonly cause hypothyroidism \nf. Less common etiologies include infiltrative diseases, \nsuch as sarcoidosis, and thyroid agenesis. \n2. Central hypothyroidism: reduction in TSH due to pimitary \nor hypothalamic disorder \na. Accounts for < 1 % of cases of hypothyroidism \nb. Pituitary adenoma is the most common cause; also \ncan occur post neurosurgery or brain radiation or as a \ncomplication of postpartum hemorrhage \nc. Granulomatous diseases, especially sarcoidosis, can \ninfiltrate the hypothalamus. \nC. Clinical manifestations \n1. Metabolic: Decreased metabolism that can lead to weight \ngain, cold intolerance, and increased total and low-density \nlipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (due to decreased clearance) \n2. Cardiac: Reduction in myocardial contractility and \nheart rate \n3. Skin: Nonpitting edema, due to accumulation of \nglycosaminoglycans; dry skin; coarse, fragile hair \n\n338 I CHAPTER 18 \n4. Central nervous system: fatigue, delayed relaxation phase of \nthe deep tendon reflexes \n5. Pulmonary: hypoventilation seen with severe hypothyroidism \n6. Gastrointestinal: reduced intestinal motility causes constipation \n7. Reproductive: menstrual abnormalities, reduced fertility, \nincreased risk of miscarriage \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism all lack sensitivity \nand specificity. \nB. The TSH is the best screening test for both primary hypothy-\nroidism and hyperthyroidism; it is not necessary to measure \nthyroid hormone levels initially unless central hypothyroidism \nis suspected. \n1. TSH does have circadian fluctuations, with higher levels \ntoward the evening. \n2. TSH levels tend to be higher in the winter and spring than \nin the summer and autumn. \nC. If the TSH is normal, no funher testing is necessary (LR- for \nhypothyroidism is< 0.01). \nD. If the TSH is elevated (LR+ for hypothyroidism is > 99), the \nfree T4 should be ordered next. \n1. Most ofT4 is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin and \nalbumin. \n2. The levels of these binding proteins are affected by a variety \nof medical conditions, thus altering the level of total T 4 \n3. Free T 4 better reflects the patient's thyroid function than \ntotal T4 \nTo assess thyroid function, order a TSH fol-\nlowed by a measurement of free T 4; do not \norder a total T 4 It is not necessary to order a T 3 \nwhen evaluating patients for hypothyroidism. \nE. If the TSH is elevated, and the free T 4 is decreased, the patient \nhas oven hypothyroidism and should be treated. \nF. If the TSH is elevated and the free T 4 is normal, the patient \nhas subclinical hypothyroidism. \n1. The TSH and free T 4 should be repeated to confirm the \ndiagnosis. \n2. The most common cause is chronic autoimmune \n(Hashimoto) thyroiditis. \n3. The overall prevalence is 4-8% but is up to 20% in women \nover 60. \n4. The progression rate to oven hypothyroidism is 4-18% \nper year; progression is more likely in patients with higher \nlevels ofTSH and positive thyroid antibodies. \n5. A meta-analysis of more than SS,000 participants found \nan increased risk of coronary heart disease events (relative \nrisk 1.89) and coronary hean disease mortality (relative \nrisk 1.S8) in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and \na TSH ~ 10 micro unit/ mL; whether treatment lowers this \nrisk is not known. \n6. Other causes of an elevated TSH with a normal T 4 include \nrecovery from non-thyroidal illness and the recovery phase \nof subacute thyroiditis. \nTreatment \nA. Overt hypothyroidism \n1. All patients should be treated with levothyroxine (T4). \n2. The full replacement dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day, but in older \npatients or those with underlying coronary disease, it is \npreferable to start with a lower of dose of2S-50 mcg/day. \n3. Levothyroxine is best absorbed on an empty stomach \n(30--60 minutes before breakfast, or before bed 2-3 hours \nafter the last meal), with a 40% reduction in absorption \nif taken with food; calcium, iron, antacids, proton \npump inhibitors, and anticonvulsants also interfere with \nabsorption. \n4. The half-life of levothyroxine is 7 days, so steady-state \nconcentration is reached in about 6 weeks. \n5. The TSH level should be checked 6 weeks after every dose \nadjustment, with the goal of increasing the dose until the \nTSH is within the normal range. \n6. Once the dose is stable, it is sufficient to check the TSH \nannually. \nB. Subclinical hypothyroidism \n1. Experts agree that patients with a TSH > 10 microunit/mL \nshould be treated; many ex:pens would also treat patients \nwith TSH levels ofS-10 microunit/L, and elevated LDL, \nsymptoms, or positive thyroid antibodies. \n2. Patients may report improved symptoms with treatment; \neffects on LDL and cardiovascular outcomes are \ninconclusive. \nREFERENCES \nBalach.andr.m JS, Pacel SR. In the clinic.

Hodo I \ndetermine the cause? \nDccpa Rani Nandiwada, MD, MS \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. T is a 66-year-old man who arrives at the emergency \ndepartment with bloody stools and dizziness. His symp-\ntoms started 2 hours ago. \n~ \nWhat is ths difft1N1ntial diagnoeie of \n1~1' GJ bls&llng7 Howould you frame the \ndlffe1'6ntlal7 \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe approach to GI bleeding is similar to the approach to other \npotentially life-threatening illnesses. Patient stabilization, specifi-\ncally, hemodynamic stabilization is the first step in management. In \na patient with significant GI bleeding, management precedes diag-\nnosis, usually made by colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenos-\ncopy (EGO). The pivotal point in the differential, post stabilization, \nis distinguishing between an upper or lower GI source for blood \nloss. From there, by using severity of the bleed, patient demograph-\nics and assessing risk factors for bleeding sources, one can narro\ndown the differential further. \nInitial management follows a regimented course. First, the \npatient must have a risk assessment for the severity of bleeding \nand preparation must be made for resuscitation if further bleed-\ning occurs. This is followed by hemodynamic stabilization and \ncompletion of initial diagnostic and therapeutic testing. \nA. Risk assessment \n1. The best risk assessment tool for upper GI bleed is the \nGlasgow-Blatchford Score. \na. The score includes variables such as blood urea nitrogen \n(BUN), hemoglobin, blood pressure, heart rate. \nb. Loscores identify low-risk patients who potentially \ncan be treated as an outpatient. \nc. A score ofO has LR- of0.02 for need for urgent \nendoscopic intervention equating to a very low-risk \npatient. \n2. For lower GI bleeding, the following patient factors \npredict poor outcomes (increased risk of monality, adverse \noutcomes or re-bleeding): \na. Initial hematocrit < 35%; OR 6.3 \nb. Age > 60; OR 4.2 \nc. Gross blood on rectal exam; OR 3.9 \nd. Heart rate> 100 bpm; OR 3.7 \ne. Systolic pressure blood pressure < 100 mm Hg; OR 3.0 \nB. Preparation for hemodynamic stabilization, resuscitation, and \nfurther bleeding \n1. All patients should have their blood typed and be cross-\nmatched for at least 2 units of packed red blood cells. \n2. Two large bore IVs \na. IV s should be S 16 gauge. \nb. Because flow= Ll.P (rtr4/8L) (where Ll.P is the pressure \ndifferential, r is the radius of the IY,  is the viscosity \nof the fluid, and Lis the length of the N), flocan be \nmaximized by \n(1) Increasing the pressure behind the fluid being \ninfused (squeezing the bag). \n(2) Decreasing the length of the IY. \n(3) Increasing the gauge of the IV (the most effective \nas the flogoes up by the founh power of any \nincrease). \nc. Large gauge IVs (16 and larger) are much more effective \nthan central lines for volwne resuscitation. \nAlways make sure your patient has 2 usable \nlarge bore IVs, so you do not have to worry \nabout IV access should life-threatening \nbleeding develop. \nd. In the setting of severe hemorrhage, a urinary catheter, \nwith regular monitoring of urinary output, hdps \nmonitor the adequacy of volume resuscitation. \nC. Hemodynamic stabilization \n1. Clinically assess volume scarus. \na. Signs of shock may be seen with 30-40% volume \ndepletion. \nb. Onhostasis can be seen with 20-25% volume depletion. \nc. Tachycardia may be present with 15% volume depletion. \n2. Calculate necessary replacement (weight in kg x 0.6 (lean \nbodyweight made up of water) x % volume depletion). \n3. Replace fluid losses initially with normal saline or Ringer \nsolution. \n4, Consider the need for blood transfusion. \na. There is general agreement on the following \nrecommendations for transfusion in actively bleeding \npatients. \n(1) Patients should receive a blood transfusion \nwhen there has been 30% loss of blood volume \n(manifested by tachycardia, hypotension, \ncachypnea, decreased urinary output, or CNS \nsymptoms [eg, anxiety/confusion]). \n\n340 I CHAPTER 19 \n(2) Alternatively, if 2 L of crystalloid have been given \nwithout successful resuscitation, blood should be \ntransfused. \n(3) If a Hb level is available, actively bleeding patients \nshould receive a transfusion when the level falls \nbelo9 g/dL because it can take time for the Hb \nto accurately reflect ongoing blood loss. \n(4) If large amounts of blood are needed (> 4 units of \npacked red blood cells), fresh frozen plasma and \nplatelets should also be given. \nb. In patients who are not bleeding, withholding \ntransfusions until the Hb is< 7 g/dL is appropriate. \n(1) This recommendation is based mainly on a study \nthat demonstrated a mortality benefit associated \nwith a restrictive transfusion strategy. \n(2) The exclusion criteria in this study were massive \nexsanguinating bleeding, an acute coronary \nsyndrome, symptomatic peripheral vasculopathy, \nstroke, or transient ischemic attack. \n(3) All patients had endoscopy within 6 hours of \npresentation. \n(4) Patients in this study also received blood if \nsymptoms of anemia or massive bleeding developed \nor if they required surgery. \nc. In patients with cardiovascular disease, a transfusion \nthreshold of B g/dL is probably appropriate. \nd. It is important to remember that patients may initially \nhave a normal hemoglobin level when they present with \nan acute hemorrhage. Hemoglobin level will only fall \nafter fluid resuscitation. \nEven after a large hemorrhage, patients may \ninitially have a normal Hb level. The level will \nonly fall after fluid resuscitation. \nS. Reviethe patient's medication list for antiplatelet \nand anticoagulant medications. The decision to reverse \nan anticoagulant is based on a careful balancing of the \nseverity of bleeding versus the need for anticoagulation. \n6. If there is concern for an upper GI bleed, empirically \nstart an IV proton pump inhibitor or octreotide or both \nbased on risk factors for peptic ulcer disease and variceal \nbleeding. \na. IV proton pump inhibitors help reduce the number of \nendoscopic interventions and risk of re-bleeds in peptic \nulcer disease without a mortality benefit. \nb. Intermittent IV or oral bolus dosing of proton \npump inhibitors is probably equivalent, if not \nsuperior to, continuously delivered proton pump \ninhibitor. \nD. Initial diagnostic tests \n1. CBC and platelet count \n2. Basic metabolic panel (chem-7) \n3. Liver biochemical tests (Abnormal results raise the risk of \nunderlying severe liver disease and thus coagulopathy and \nvarices.) \n4. Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time \nS. Upright chest radiograph \na. Most important if there is abdominal tenderness \nto assess for free air in the abdomen arising from \na perforated viscus \nb. Patients taking immunosuppressants (including \ncorticosteroids) may have free air in the abdomen \nwith only mild abdominal symptoms. \nc. Radiographs may, infrequently, provide other \ndiagnostic clues. \n6. Nasogastric (NG) tube placement, which was once \nconsidered standard, is nocontroversial. \na. An NG tube is a minimally invasive way to assess the \nacuity of bleeding and to help localize its source. \nb. Blood or coffee grounds in an NG aspirate is indicative \nof an upper GI bleed (LR+, 9.6). \nc. On the other hand, a negative lavage does not exclude \nan upper GI source. \nd. Research has suggested that NG tube placement does \nnot change patient outcomes {mortality, length of stay, \nvolume of transfused blood, need for surgery). \nThe differential diagnosis of GI bleeding is based on an ana-\ntomic framework. Upper GI bleeds originate proximal to the lig-\nament of Treitz, while lower GI bleeds originate from areas distal \nto the ligament and are primarily colonic. Therefore, the pivotal \npoints in a patient's evaluation are characteristics that argue for an \nupper or lower GI source. Among others, these include history of \nprevious upper or lower bleeding episodes, epigastric pain, melena, \nand blood in an NG lavage, all of which suggest an upper GI bleed. \nThe causes of upper and lower GI bleeding are arranged beloin \nthe approximate order of frequency. Bleeding from a small bowel \nsource is less common. The last category is anorectal bleeding. \nThese are generally smaller bleeds with limited potential to cause \nhemodynamic instability. \nA. Upper GI bleeds \n1. Common \na. Peptic ulcer disease \nb. Esophageal or gastric varices \nc. Mallory-Weiss tear \n2. Less common \na. Angiodysplasia \nb. Gastritis \nc. Malignancy \nd.

Anal fissures \n\nMr. T was well until this morning. Abdominal cramping devel-\noped while he was eating breakfast. He did not have nausea. \nHe went to the bathroom and passed a large bowel move-\nment af stool mixed with blooc:i. Afterward. he felt better \nand went to !le down. About 30 minutes later, he had the \nsame e;ensatlon and this time passed what he dee.crlbed \nas \"about a pint\" of bright red blooc:i. While getting up from \nthe toilet, he became dizzy and had to sit on the bathroom \nfloor for 15 minutes before he could crawl to the phone to \ndlal 911. \nAt this point, what Is the lsadlng hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altematlvH, and 15 \nthere a must not miS& diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnosis, what teete should be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe lack of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, and the pres-\nence of bright red blood per rectum are pivotal points in this case \nand make a lower GI source most likely. Cramping is often seen \nwith GI bleeds, caused by blood passing through the bowel. The \npatient's age, acuity, and volume of blood makes bleeding from \ndiverticuli, colitis, malignancy, or angiodysplasia the most likely \ndiagnoses. Whether he has had a recent change in bawd habits, \nweight loss, or previous bloody stools is unknown; all these factors \nwould heighten suspicion for colitis or malignancy. The amount of \nblood loss and symptomatic dizziness make hemorrhoids or fissures \nunlikely. Upper sources of bleeding must also be considered. A \nbrisk bleed from an upper source can present with bright red blood \nper recrum. Assuming there is no history of liver disease, peptic \nulcer disease would be the most likely upper source. Table 19-1 lists \nthe differential diagnosis. \n\nBlood is a cathartic. A brisk bleed from an \nupper source can present with bright red blood \nper rectum. \nMr. T reports no recent Illness or change In bowel habits. He \nreports no famlly history of colon cancer, and he has never \nhad a colonoscopy. He has a fifty-pack year smoking history \nand quit about 6 years ~o. He reports drinking 2-4 beers \neach night. \nOn physical exam, Mr. T looks anxious but is otherwise \nwell. While sitting. his BP is 120/92 mm Hg and his pulse \nIs 100 bpm. While standln9, his BP Is 100/80 mm Hg \nand his pulse Is 122 bpm. His temperature Is 37.oc and \nhis RR is 16 breaths per minute. There is no conjunctiva! \npallor. Lun9s and heart exams are normal.

There may be abdominal cramping but no \nreal pain. A history may include previously diagnosed diverticuli \n(on a screening colonoscopy, for instance) and possibly a previous, \nself-limited hemorrhage. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Diverticular bleeds are the most common cause of lower \nGI bleeding. \n1. The prevalence of the various causes of G I bleeding varies \nfrom study to study. \n2. One large reviegave the following data: \na. Diverticulosis: 35% \nb. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or other colitis: 14% \nc. Colonic malignancy or polyp: 7% \nd. Angiodysplasia: 3% \ne. Anorectal cause: 12% \nB. The risk of diverticular hemorrhage in a patient with \ndiverticuli is not known but is estimated to be 3-15%. \nC. Data from case-control studies suggest that nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and hypenension are \nrisk factors for diverticular hemorrhage. \nD. Although diverticula are most commonly left sided, right-\nsided lesions are responsible for most bleeding episodes. \n\n342 I CHAPTER 19 \nE. Bleeding occurs as a vessel is stretched over the dome of a \ndiverticulurn. Lurninal trauma likely leads to bleeding from \nthe weakened vessel. \nF. Spontaneocessation and only moderate blood loss is the \nrule, but recurrence is common. \nI. About 75% of patients experience spontaneous cessation \nof hemorrhage. \n2. Nearly all patients require < 4 units of packed red blood \ncells. \n3. Approximately 40% of patients have recurrent bleeding. \nG. Diverticular hemorrhage carries a poor shon-term prognosis. \n1. In general, lower GI bleeding carries a better overall \nprognosis than upper GI bleeding with about half the \nmortality rate. \n2. Mortality rates for diverticular hemorrhage are higher \n(11 % at 1 year and 20% at 4 years) although the cause \nof death is rarely related to the GI hemorrhage. \nAlthough diverticular hemorrhage seldom \ncawes death, it is a marker for a relatively poor, \nshort-term prognosis. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam \nI. The first step in making the diagnosis of any GI bleed \nis to determine whether the source of the bleeding is the \nupper or lower tract. Other than frank hematemesis, only a \nfefeatures are strongly predictive in localizing the site of \nbleeding to the upper or lower tract. These are outlined in \nTable 19-2. \nTable 19-2. Test characteristics of clinical findings for \nupper vs lower GI bleeding. \nCllnlcal Finding \nSensitivity Speclfldty \nLR+ \nLR-\nUpper GI Bleedlng \nMelenic stools on \nexam \nBlood or coffee \ngrounds in an \nNG aspirate \nPrior history of upper \nGlbleed \nHistory of black stool \nAge < 50 years \nCirrhosis \nLower GI Bleeding \nPresence of blood \nclots in stool \nHistory of lower \nGlbleed \nPhysician seeing \nbright red blood \n49% \n44% \n22% \n77-95% \n27% \n5% \n14% \n36% \n46% \nGI, gastrointestinal; NG, nasogastrtc. \n98% \n0.52 \n95% \n9.6 \n0.58 \n96% \n6.2 \n0.81 \n81-87% \n5.1-5.9 \n0.06-0.27 \n92% \n3.5 \n0.80 \n99% \n3.1 \n0.93 \n99% \n0.87 \n94% \n0.68 \n90% \n4.6 \n0.6 \na. Patients who are volume depleted, onhostatic, or \nhypotensive are about twice as likely to have an upper \nGI bleed than a lower GI bleed. \nb. Becawe urea is produced as blood is processed \nthroughout the GI tract, a BUN/creatinine ratio \n> 30 suggests an upper GI source (sensitivity, 39%; \nspecificity, 94%; LR+, 7.5; LR-, 0.64) \nc. Although hematochezia generally suggests a lower \nGI source of bleeding, 10-15% of patients with \nhematochezia have an upper GI source. These \npatients are more likely to be older and to have \nduodenal ulcers. \n~ \n10-15% of patients with hematochezia have an \ny \nupper GI source of bleeding. \n2. Beyond differentiating between upper and lower sources \nof GI bleeding, certain historical features may point to a \nspecific diagnosis (Table 19-3). \na. These features should be sought in every patient with \nGI bleeding. \nb. They are, however, only suggestive and by no means \ndiagnostic. \nB. Endoscopy \n1. In a patient with GI bleeding, EGO is usually \nrecommended as the first procedure unless the \nsuspicion for a lower GI bleed is very high (based on \nhistory and, possibly, a negative NG tube aspirate). \nThis recommendation is based partly on the higher \npotential for life-threatening blood loss from upper \nGI bleeds. \n2. Colonoscopy \na. The diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage is usually \nmade on colonoscopy. \nb. It is important to realize that this diagnosis is wually \npresumptive (87% of the time in some studies) based \non seeing diverticula and blood in the same region of \nthe colon. \nTable 19-3.

Less commonly, a definitive diagnosis is made when \nactive bleeding or stigmata of recent bleeding in a \ndiverticulum is seen. \nC. Radionuclide scintigraphy \n1. Uses either radiolabeled sulfur colloid or labeled red \nblood cells. \n2. Can detect bleeding as sloas 0.05 mUmin. \n3. Most commonly used for detecting the source of bleeding \nin patients with persistent bleeding and normal upper and \nlower endoscopies. \n4. Also used to localize bleeding prior to resection or \nangiography. \n5. The test characteristics of radionuclide scintigraphy in GI \nbleeding are not well defined, varying from study to study. \na. In a representative study, only 39% of patients had \npositive scans (sensitivity= 39%). \nb. In this study of patients who had further evaluation of \ntheir bleeding, 48% were found to have bleeding at the \nsight of the positive scan and 10% were found to have \nbleeding at a different site. \nc. Scans in patients who recently required transfusion are \nmost likely to be positive; scans that turn positive quickly \nare best at localizing bleeding (about 95% accurate). \nD. Angiography \n1. Requires bleeding at a rate of about 0.5 mUmin to detect \nactive bleeding. \n2. Sensitivity is about 50% (though that number depends \ngreatly on selection of patients). \n3. Like radionuclide scintigraphy, angiography can be useful \nfor localizing the site of bleeding before surgery and is \nconsidered more reliable. \n4. An angiographic procedure also presents the option of \ncatheter-based intervention. \nTreatment \nA. Management of blood loss \n1. As discussed above, all GI bleeds call for similar treatment \nof a patient who has lost, or has the potential to lose, a \nsignificant amount of blood. \n2. Patients need to be closely monitored for signs of bleeding \n(increasing tachycardia, orthostasis, oliguria, declining Hb). \n3. Typically, patients have a CBC checked every 6 hours until \nstability has been achieved but the intensity of monitoring \nvaries with risk of rebleeding. \nB. Management of diverticular hemorrhage \n1. Because most diverticular hemorrhages stop spontaneously, \nspecific treatment is often not necessary. \n2. Endoscopic treatment is primarily clipping, although \nthermocoagulation and sclerotherapy are occasionally used. \n3. Angiographic intervention, with vasoconstrictor agents \nor embolization, can also be used. Occasionally, local \nvasopressin infusion may be a temporizing measure. \nC. Colectomy \n1. Curative therapy for diverticular bleeding is removal of the \nportion of the colon containing the diverticula. \n2. Recommended for either persistent, large bleeds (over \n4 units in 24 hours or 10 units during the course of a \nsingle bleed) or for frequent recurrences. \nGI BLEEDING I 343 \nThe diagnosis of divenicular hemorrhage is \noften presumptive. Localization of the bleed-\ning site before surgery must be as definitive as \npossible. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr. T wae; given 1 L of normal e;allne. While In t he emergency \ndepartment, he again paaaed a \nla~ amount of bright \nred blood. \nInitial laboratory teats are normal. Important values are \nBUN, 12 mg/dl; creatinine, 1.1 mg/dl; Hb, 13.9 g/dl. The \npatient was admitted to the medical ICU. \nHave you c:roe5Bd a diagnostic: th1'8ehold for \nthe leading h)'pOthHie, dlvertlcular bleed? \nHave you ruled out the active alternatlvee1 \nDo other teets ns&I to be done to exc:lude the \naltematlve diagnoses? \nMr. T weighs 75 kg and his orthostasis suggests 20% volume deple-\ntion. His fluid deficit is about 9 L (75 kg x 20% volume depletion \nx 60%). Assuming this deficit is all from the GI bleed, it is very \nlikely that his Hb will fall once he is hydrated. \nHis hematochezia and normal BUN/creatinine ratio are sug-\ngestive of a lower GI bleed. Although Mr. T is relatively young \nand does not have any comorbidities, he was admitted to the \nICU because he has signs of hemodynamic instability, includ-\ning orthostasis with tachycardia, and has shown evidence of \nactive bleeding. Hemodynamic instability and active bleeding \neach independently are associated with tripling the risk of poor \noutcomes, such as rebleeding and mortality. Following stabiliza-\ntion, initial endoscopy with either colonoscopy or EGD would \nbe reasonable. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Angiodysplasia \nTextbook Presentation \nBleeding from angiodysplasia can look like any other cause of \nlower GI bleeding. It is seen almost exclusively in older adults and \ncan present with anything from hematochezia to occult blood loss. \nIn general, hemorrhage from angiodysplasia tends to be less brisk \nthan bleeding from diverticula. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Angiodysplasias, also called aneriovenous malformations, are \ndilated submucosal veins that are most commonly seen in the \nright colon of adults over age 60. \nB. Present in < 5% of patients over age 60. \nC. Most patients with angiodysplasias do not bleed and those \nthat do tend to have occult blood loss rather than brisk, oven \nhemorrhage. \nD. Angiodysplasia has historically been associated with various \ndiseases (eg, aortic stenosis, cirrhosis) but only a relationship \nto end-stage renal disease seems definite. \nEvidence--Based Diagnosis \nA. As in divenicular hemorrhage, colonoscopy, tagged red blood cell \nscan, and angiography are all used in the diagnostic evaluation. \n\n344 I CHAPTER 19 \nB. Colonoscopy is the most common tool. It allowii good visual-\nization of the cecum, which is the site of most angiodysplasias. \nC. If suspicious vascular patterns are seen during colonoscopy, \nangiography can provide evidence of a diagnosis even without \nactive bleeding. \nD. As in diverticular hemorrhage, the diagnosis is often presump-\ntive, made on the basis of visualizing nonbleeding angiodys-\nplasia in a patient with GI bleeding. \nTreatment \nA. Both acute and chronic bleeding is generally treated endo-\nscopically with thermal or laser ablation. This method can be \nrepeated for recurrent bleeding. \nB. Angiographic intervention, with vasoconsuicror agents or \nembolization, is rarely used. \nC. Surgical management (right hemicolectomy) is sometimes \nrequired for frequent, recurrent bleeding. \nD. Hormonal therapy with estrogen has been used to prevent \nrecurrent bleeding in angiodysplasia, but recent smdies suggest \nthat this is not very effective. \nE. Whenever possible, long-term antiplatelet therapy should be \ndiscontinued. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT W \nMr. M Is a 39-year-old man who arrives at the emergency \ndepartment after vomiting blood. He reports waking the \nmorning of admission with an \"upset stomach.\" He Initially \nattributed this to a hangover. After about an hour he vom-\ntted a gallon of blood\" with no other stomach contents. \nAlmost immediately afterward, he had a second episode of \nhematemesis and called 911. \nA\"t; 'thie poin\"t;, wha\"t; ie '!;he leading hypo'theeie, \nwhat are the active alternatlvee, and le \nthere a muet not mlee dlagnoele7 Given thle \ndifferential dlagnoeie, what teete ehoukJ be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. M is having an upper GI bleed. The hematemesis is a pivotal \npoint in this case and locali7.CS the source of the bleeding to above \nthe ligament ofTreitz. Peptic ulcer disease and gastritis are the most \ncommon causes of upper GI bleeding. Although not always pres-\nent, preceding symptoms of abdominal distress are common with \npeptic ulcer disease and gastritis. When incorporating patient-\nspecillc risk fuctors, such as this patient's alcohol use, esophageal \nvarices should be added to the differential diagnosis. The details \nof the patient's alcohol use are still unknown, so his risk of ponal \nhypertension cannot be predicted. A Mallory-Weiss tear is also pos-\nsible, but the patient would repon vomiting before the onset of \nbleeding. Table 19-4 lists the differential diagnosis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Colon Cancer \nColon cancer is discussed in Chapter 2, Screening & Health \nMaintenance. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nSix hours and 3 L of normal saline after his initial Hb of \n13.9 g/dL, a repeat Hb was 10.3 g/dl. Given the clinical \nsuspicion of a lower GJ bleed, colonoscopY was done about \n6 hours after admission. There were multiple left-sided \ndlvertlcula and a right -sided dlvertlculum with a nonbleed-\ning visible vessel. A diagnosis of a diverticular hemorrhage \nwas made. \nMr. T remained clinically euvolemic and his Hb stabilized \naround 10.0 g/dl. He remained in the hospital for 48 hours \nduring which there was no recurrent bleeding and his Hb \nremained stable. No further t reat ment (eg, surgery) was \nnecessary. \nTable 19-4.

If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Esophageal Variceal \nHemorrhage \nTcnbook Presentation \nA patient with known cirrhosis presents with heavy upper GI bleed-\ning {hematemesis or melena). Stigmata of chronic liver disease as \nwell as a history of previous hemorrhages are frequently present. \nLaboratory data demonstrate liver biochemical tests consistent \nwith cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Esophageal varices are portosyi;temic collaterals that dilate \nwhen portal pressures exceed 12 mm Hg. \nB. Although varices are the second most common cause of \nupper GI bleeding, they account for 80-90% ofGI bleeds in \npatients with cirrhosis. \nC. Gastroesophageal varices are present in about 50% of patients \nwith cirrhosis. \nD. The prevalence of varices depends on the severity of the \ncirrhosis. \nE. The Child-Pugh system classifies patients based on the severity \nof their cirrhosis. \n1. The system takes into account the presence of \nencephalopathy, ascites, hyperbilirubinemia, \nhypoalbuminemia, and dotting deficiencies {Table 19-5). \n2. 40% of patients with Child-Pugh grade A disease have \nvarices, while 85% of patients with grade C disease have \nvarices. \nF. Approximately 33% of patients with varices experience \nhemorrhage. \nG. Varices may develop from cirrhosis of any cause. \nGI BLEEDING I 345 \nTable 19-5.

Up to 60% of survivors have recurrent bleeding in the first \nyear. \n3. A variceal bleed carries a 32-80% 1-year mortality and a \n6-week mortality of 15-20%. \n4. A hepatic venous pressure gradient > 20 mm Hg predicts \npoor outcomes. \n~ \nEsophageal varices are, by far, the most lethal \n,.,.... type of GI bleeding. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Esophageal varices are diagnosed with endoscopy. \nB. Screening for varices \n1. Because variceal bleeding carries such a high mortality, \nthe goal is to detect varices before they bleed so that \nprophylactic treatment can be initiated. \n2. All patients with cirrhosis should undergo screening \nendoscopy every other year. \n3. Patients with cirrhosis but without splenomegaly or \nthrombocytopenia are at the lowest risk for having varices \n(about 4%). Endoscopy may be delayed in these patients. \nC. Of all causes of G I bleeding, varices are probably the easiest \nto predict. One study has the sensitivity and specificity of \nphyi;icians predictingvariceal hemorrhage at 82% and 96%, \nrespectively. \nTreatment \nA. Primary prophylaxis {patients with varices but no previous \nbleeding) \n1. Nonselective beta-blockers (usually propranolol or nadolol) \neffectively decrease portal pressures. \n2. Patients at higher risk for bleeding should also undergo \nband ligation of the varices. \nB. Secondary prophylaxis (patients who have had a previous \nvariceal hemorrhage) \n1. Portosystemic shunt procedures, either surgical or \ntransjugular, should be considered. \n2. Liver transplantation is the definitive therapy. \nC. Treatment of acute hemorrhage \n\n346 I CHAPTER 19 \n1. Even more than other GI bleeds, achievement of \nhemodynarnic stability in variceal bleeds is of primary \nimportance because the hemorrhage is potentially massive. \n2. Patients with variceal bleeding are at high risk for bacterial \ninfections, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. \nAdministration of antibiotics (ceftriaxone or norfloxacin), \ngiven prior to endoscopy, have been shown to decrease both \nthe rate of bacterial infections and mortality. \n3. Attention should be paid to the patient's coagulation status. \na. Given the prevalence of liver disease in these patients, \nthere is often coagulopathy related to factor deficiency \nor thrombocytopenia. \nb. Platelet transfusions are recommended for levels under \n50,000/mcL during an active bleed. \n4. Somatostatin or octreotide should be given as soon as \nvariceal hemorrhage is suspected. These drugs decrease \nportal pressure and decrease bleeding. \nS. Endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy are done initially and \nif bleeding recurs. \n6. Balloon tamponade may be used as a temporizing measure \nprior to endoscopic therapy. \n7. Transvenous intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) \nis an option for patients who continue to bleed despite \nintervention. In high-risk patients, such as Child-Pugh \nclass C, early shunt placement has a survival benefit. \n8. Surgical intervention is seldom called for as the mortality is \nextremely high. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nNG tube lavage in the emergency department revealed \nbright ned blood that did not clear with flushing. The patient \nwas admitted to the ICU and received 1 L of normal sallne \nand 2 units of 0- packed RBCs. An lndwelllng urinary cath-\neter was placed to assist in monitoring his volume status. \nAfter another large episode of hematemesls. Mr. M was \nintubated for airway protection. IV octreotide was begun. \nand the GI service was called to perform urgent endoscop:y. \nHave you croeNd. a d.lagnoetlc threehold. for \nthe lead.Ing hypothesis, varlcul hemorrhage1 \nHave you ruled out the actlve alternatlvae1 \nDo other tests need to be done to e><clude the \nalternative diagnoeee1 \nThe patient is having a large upper GI bleed and is clearly actively \nbleeding. Initial management is aimed at hemodynarnic stabili-\nzation. The decision to place the patient in the ICU was based \non his hemodynamic instability, active bleeding, and the need for \nclose monitoring. Given the alcohol history, the volume of the \nbleed, and the lack of previous abdominal symptoms, bleeding \nfrom esophageal varices is highest on the differential diagnosis, and \nempiric therapy is begun with octreotide and antibiotics. Peptic \nulcer disease is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding, and \nwe do not yet knowhether this patient has cirrhosis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Peptic Ulcer Disease \nThe details of peptic ulcer disease are discussed in Chapter 32, \nUnintentional Weight Loss. This section will only deal with hem-\norrhage from peptic ulcers. \nTenbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is a middle-aged person who has chronic \ndyspepsia; has used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs), including aspirin, long-term; or who has Htlicohacter \npylori infection and an episode of hematemesis, melena, or both. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Most common cause of GI bleeds. \n1. Upper GI bleeds are 4-8 times more common than lower \nGI bleeds. \n2. Peptic ulcer disease accounts fur at least 50% of upper \nGI bleeds. \nB. Bleeding occurs when an ulcer erodes into a vessel in the \nstomach or duodenal wall. \nC. About 50% of patients with bleeding or perforation have had \nno previous symptoms. \nD. Causative factors are H pylori infection, long-term use of \nNSAIDs, or stress from critical illness. \nE. Similar to diverticula, most cases are self-limited (about 80%). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Except in rare cases, all patients with GI bleeding \nin whom an ulcer is suspected undergo endoscopy. \nEndoscopy is useful from diagnostic, prognostic, and \ntherapeutic standpoints. \nB. Endoscopy has a 92% sensitivity for ulcers. Biopsy during \nendoscopy allows fur the exclusion of malignancy and H pylori \ninfection as a cause of the ulcer. \nC. Endoscopy is also useful because it gives information about a \npatient's risk of recurrent bleeding and thus enables discharge \nplanning. Table 19-6 gives approximate rates for recurrent \nbleeding by endoscopic finding. \nD. Other endoscopic findings associated with high risk are ulcer \nsize > 2 cm and arterial bleeding. \nTreatment \nA. Hemodynamic stabilization \nB. Endoscopy \n1. Early endoscopy achieves hemostasis in > 94% of patients \nand decreases length of hospital stay. \n2. For patients with a high-risk lesion, endoscopic \nintervention such as clipping, thermocoagulation, or \nsclerotherapy is warranted. \n3. Repeat endoscopy is effective in the 15-20% of patients \nwho have a recurrence of bleeding. \nC. Medication \n1. IV H2-blockers are no longer recommended fur acutely \nbleeding ulcers. \nTable 19-6. Approximate rates for recurrent bleeding by \nendoscopic finding. \nlAlsion \nRebldlng Rte \nActively oozing vessel \n55% \n---------------------------------------\nNonbleeding visible vessel \n45% \n---------------------------------------\nAdherent clot \n15-35% \n___________________________ , ______________________ _ \nClean based ulcer \n5% \n\n2. Proton pump inhibitors \na. IV proton pump inhibitors should be given ro patients \nadmitted with suspected bleeding ulcers. Meta-analyses \nsuppon the use of intermittent N bolus or oral proton \npump inhibitors; however, guidelines do not reflect this \nnedata yet. \nb. Patients found to be at high risk for rebleeding \n(Table 19-6) on endoscopy should continue this \ntherapy for 72 hours. \nc. Patients at lorisk can be switched to oral proton \npump inhibitors. \nd. All patients who are discharged should be taking \nproton pump inhibitors (as well as H pylori therapy, \nif warranted) to ensure ulcer healing. \ne. Patients taking aspirin for secondary prophylaxis can be \nrestarted within 1 to 7 days of resolution of bleeding. \n Meta-analysis supports administering erythromycin before \nendoscopy because it increases the diagnostic yield of the \nprocedure and reduces the need to repeat endoscopy. \nD. Patients who have rebleeding that cannot be controlled endo-\nscopically can undergo either embolization or surgical therapy. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Mallory-Weiss Tear \nTatbook Presentation \nMallory-Weiss tear is typically seen in patients with vomiting of \nany cause in whom hematemesis develops acutely. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Mallory-Weiss tears are mucosal tears at the gastroesophageal \njunction. \nB. It is a common misconception that Mallory-Weiss \ntears always folloretching. In fact, a history of \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMs. S is a 35-year-old woman who comes to the out-\npatient clinic for an initial visit. She is well and is without \ncomplalnt5.

This type of bleeding can be categorized as benign sounding \nanorectal bleeding. It is bleeding in a young patient without \"red \nflags\" for serious disease such as anemia, change in bowel habits, \nGI BLEEDING I 347 \nretching preceding hematemesis is present in only about \none-third of cases. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nDiagnosis is routinely made on upper endoscopy. \nTreatment \nMallory-Weiss tears seldom require specific treatment. Rebleeding \nis quite rare. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nEmergency endoscopy was performed in the ICU. Mr. M \nwas found to have large esophageal and gast ric varices. A \nclear bleeding source was found and t reated with banding. \nAlthough there was no clinically sign lflca nt rebleedlng, other \ncomplications developed. He remained Intubated for 5 days \nfor presumed aspiration pneumonia, experienced alcohol \nwithdrawal, and developed mild encephalopathy. \nDuring t he hospitalization, he was found to have Child-\nPugh grade B cirrhosis. At the time of discharge, he was \ntaking propranolol and lactulose. Follow-up in an outpat ient \nalcohol program and the hepatology practice was sched-\nuled. He did not come to any follow-up visits. \nMr. M's emergent endoscopy was indicated by the severity of the \nbleeding. His bleeding was controlled with a combination of med-\nical and endoscopic management. The complicated hospital course \nis not surprising given the comorbid conditions frequently present \nin patients with varices. Mr. M had advanced cirrhosis and alcohol \ndependence. \nweight loss, or diarrhea. Between 10% and 20% of the popula-\ntion will have this type of bleeding. The goal is to diagnose these \npatients appropriately withouc missing occasional serious lesions \nand without subjecting excessive numbers of patients to unpleasant \nevaluation. The pivotal points, in this case, are the patient's young \nage, the small volume ofblood loss, and the absence of\"red flags.\" \nThe differential diagnosis includes hemorrhoidal bleeding and \nbleeding from anal fissures. Anal fissures are usually painful so hem-\norrhoids are the more likely diagnosis in this case. IBD, especially \nulcerative colitis, could cause similar symptoms, but the intermit-\ntent nature of symptoms and characterization of the bleeding, (rare \nand small volume) make IBD less likely. We need to knomore \nabout the patient's bowel habits. Diverticula and colonic angiodys-\nplasia could account for the patient's symptoms but would be very \nunusual in a patient this age. Colon or rectal cancer is also rare \nin this age group but should be considered. Table 19-7 lists the \ndifferential diagnosis. \n\nOn further history, Ms. S reports no recent change In \nbowel habits, no weight loss, and says she feels well.

The pain is worst with bowel movements, straining, \nor sitting. Occasionally, hemorrhoids can present with painless \nbleeding. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Hemorrhoids are generally classified as external or internal. \n1. External hemorrhoids \na. Occur belothe dentate line. \nb. Present either as painless bleeding or with engorged, \npainful, swollen perianal tissue; or with thrombosis. \nThrombosed hemorrhoids are purple, extremely painful, \nand may bleed. \n2, Internal hemorrhoids \na. Occur above the dentate line. \nb. Symptoms can be a feeling of internal fullness, painless \nbleeding, or prolapse. Prolapse is usually painful and \nsometimes associated with bleeding. \n3. Both internal and external hemorrhoids are most \nsymptomatic when sitting, straining, and with \nconstipation. \n4. Bleeding occurs during defecation and commonly is seen \non toilet paper when wiping. \nA clinician should always verify a patient's \nself-diagnosis of hemorrhoids. Many patients \nrefer to all perianal symptoms as hemorrhoids. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Hemorrhoidal bleeding is diagnosed by direct observation. \n1. This may be accomplished visually in patients with external \nhemorrhoids. \n2. Patients with internal hemorrhoids require anoscopy to see \nhemorrhoids. \nB. An important question is \"When does benign sounding \nanorectal bleeding need a more extensive evaluation than \nan anal exam with or without anoscopy?\" \n1. One study looked at 201 patients whose revieof \nsymptoms revealed rectal bleeding. \na. 24% of these patients were found to have serious \ndisease. The diseases were polyps (13%), colon cancer \n(6.5%), and IBD (4%). \nb. Factors associated with risk of serious disease were age, \nshort duration of bleeding, and blood mixed with stool. \nc. No cancers were found in patients younger than 50. \nd. 6 of the 37 patients who had a clear source of anorectal \nbleeding (fissures or hemorrhoids) also had polyps or \ncancer. \n2. Another study found only 10 polyps among 314 patients \nunder 40 with rectal bleeding compared with 27 polyps \nand 1 case of cancer among 256 patients between the ages \nof 40 and 50. \nC. In general, if a young patient {under age 40) with rectal bleed-\ning does not have a clear anorectal source or if the bleeding \ncontinues despite treatment of the anorectal source, a more \ncomplete evaluation (with colonoscopy) should be done. \nPatients over 40 should always be evaluated. \nTreatment \nAlthough serious disease is rare among young \npeople with rectal bleeding, it does occur. \nA. Most hemorrhoids and anal fissures can be treated conserva-\ntivdy with general recommendations for perianal wdl being. \n1. Sitz baths to relax anal sphincter. \n2. Analgesia with acetaminophen, topical creams, or shon-term \ntopical corticosteroids. A doughnut cushion is sometimes \nhelpful for prolonged sitting. \n3. Soften stool with increased fluid intake, a high-fiber diet, \nand docusate sodium or mineral oil. \n4. Avoid anything that may lead to constipation. \n5. Avoid prolonged sitting, especially on the toilet. \nB. Internal hemorrhoids that prolapse or continue to bleed \nusually require surgical removal. \nC. Thrombosed, irreducible internal hemorrhoids and thrombosed \nexternal hemorrhoids require rapid surgical treatment. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMs. 5 has a normal general physical exam. External anal \nexam and. digital rectal exam are normal. Anoscopy reveals \n1 large, nonbleeding !ntemal hemorrhoid. A CBC is normal. \n\nHave you croel!l&I a dlagnaetlc threehold \nfar the ll'Jadlng hypothsele, hemorrholdal \n111eedlng1 Have you ruled out the active \nalternatlves1 Do other tests need ta be done \nta exclude the alternative diagn05B51 \nThe patient has an internal hemorrhoid on exam. This is almost \ncertainly, but not definitely, the cause of her bleeding. Because she \nis currently asymptomatic, it would be reasonable to postpone fur-\nther work-up for now. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Anal Fissures \nTenbook Presentation \nPatients typically have severe rectal pain with bowel movements \nand bright red blood on the toilet paper. On ph)75ical exam, a \nfissure can be found at the midline, posterior to the anal opening. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Anal fissures occur secondary to trauma to the mucosa of the \nanal canal, most commonly by hard stool. \nB. Fissures usually present as acute onset, painful defecation, \nusually with bleeding. \nC. Fissures can become chronic. \n1. Pain causes anal sphincter spasm that, in turn, causes \nrecurrent trauma. \n2. Chronic fissures can be associated with sentinel piles \n(essentially a thickening of the skin at the end of a fissure). \nD. Fissures are present at the midline. \n1. Fissures are usually posterior in men and can be posterior \nor anterior in women. \n2. Other diagnoses, such as Crohn disease or sexually \ntransmitted diseases, should be considered when fissures are \nlateral to the anal opening. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Fissures are diagnosed by direct observation. \nB. Ph)75ical exam is sometimes difficult since patients are often in \npain. \nTreatment \nA. In most cases, general supportive recommendations outlined \nabove for the treatment of hemorrhoids will bring relief of \nsymptoms in days to weeks. \nB. More chronic fissures often need therapy to relax the anal \nsphincter. \n1. Topical nitrates and injected botulinum toxin are effective. \n2. Surgical sphincterotomy is almost alwa}'5 effective but \ncarries a small risk of permanent fecal incontinence. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nOne year later Ms. 5 returns to the clinic with recurrent \nbleed!~. AnoscopY revealed a bleeding Internal hemor-\nrhold. Symptoms resolve with supportive care, but bleeding \nrecurs 1 month later. Colono5COpY Is performed and reveals \nGI BLEEDING I 349 \nonly internal hemorrhoids. The patient declines definitive \ntherapY and continues to experience rare episodes of hem-\norrhoidal bleeding. \nThe patient's history of recurrent bleeding is quite common. Many \npatients with hemorrhoids will have occasional flares. The decision \nto perform colonoscopy was a difficult one. Although her young \nage and presence of an abnormality on anoscopy makes serious \ndisease unlikely, evaluation of any patient with recurrent rectal \nbleeding is appropriate. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nOccult GI Bleeding \nTenbook Presentation \nOccult GI bleeding presents in 1 of 2 ways: either in a patient with \nnewly discovered iron deficiency anemia or in a patient with posi-\ntive fecal occult blood tests. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Generally a disease of older patients; average age in most \nstudies is the early 60s. \nB. Upper GI lesions cause occult GI bleeding slightly more \ncommon than lower GI lesions. \nC. The common causes of upper and lower GI bleeding account \nfor most causes of occult GI bleeding. \nD. Long-term aspirin, NSAID, or alcohol use is found in about \n40% of patients with an upper GI tract lesion. \nE. About 5% of patients have lesions of both the upper and \nlower GI tract. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. All patients with occult GI bleeding need evaluation of the \nGI tract. \nB. All patients with iron deficiency anemia need to have the cause \nof the iron deficiency identified (see Chapter 6, Anemia). \nI. Iron deficiency is usually due to chronic blood loss. Rarely, \nit is due to poor iron intake or iron malabsorption. \n2. Menstrual and GI blood loss are the most common sources. \n3. All men, all women without menorrhagia, and all women \nover 50 (even those with menorrhagia) need to have an \nevaluation of the GI tract. \n4. Women under age 40 with menorrhagia do not necessarily \nneed further GI evaluation unless they have GI symptoms \nor a family history of early colon cancer. \nS. Women between 40 and 50 years of age with menorrhagia \nneed to be managed carefully. They should be asked about \nminimal GI symptoms (celiac disease causes iron deficiency \nthrough malabsorption and the symptoms can be easily \nattributed to irritable bowel syndrome). There should be a \nlothreshold for recommending colonoscopy in this subset \nof patients. \n~ \nAlways determine the source of blood loss in \ny \noccult GI bleeding and iron deficiency anemia. \nC. Evaluation of the GI tract in patients with occult GI bleeding \nshould be done as follows: \n\n350 I CHAPTER 19 \n1. Colonoscopy alone is sufficient in patients with only a \npositive fecal occult blood test and no iron deficiency. \n2. Evaluation of entire GI tract is recommended by most \nexperts for those patients with iron deficiency anemia or iron \ndeficiency anemia and positive feca1 occult blood testing. \n3. Video capsule endoscopy should be used in patients in \nwhom EGD and colonoscopy are inconclusive. \nSmall Bowel Bleeding \nTatbook Presentation \nPatients with small bowel bleeding may present with either occult \nor overt bleeding. Diagnosis of a small bowel source is made during \nsmall bowel imaging or endoscopy after negative evaluation of the \ncolon and upper GI tract. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. 5-10% of patients with GI bleeding have a negative evaluation \nof the upper and lower GI tract. \n1. With current endoscopic and radiologic techniques, \napproximately 75% of these patients will be found to have \na small bowel source of bleeding. \n2. The remainder of cases have lesions of the upper or lower \nGI tract missed on initial EGD and colonoscopy. \nB. Sources of bleeding \n1. Angiodysplasia is the most common source of bleeding in \nthe small bowel. \n2. Crohn disease, Dieulafoy lesions, malignancy (accounting \nfor about 10% of small bowel bleeding), and Meckel \ndiverticula are other common causes. \nC. Obscure GI bleeding, which used to refer to GI bleeding \nwith negative upper and lower endoscopy, noonly refers to \nGI bleeding with normal upper and lower endoscopy as well \nas small bowel evaluation by advanced endoscopic or radio~ \ngraphic procedures. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. A directed history may provide clues to the source of small \nbowel or obscure GI bleeding. Ask about the use of medications \nthat can cause mucosal damage (eg, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates) \nas well as a history of diseases that predispose patients to \nGI bleeding (HIY, neuroflbromatosis}. \nB. Repeat endoscopy, looking for lesions that were missed on the \ninitial evaluation, is often the initial step in the diagnosis. \nC. If repeated upper and lower endoscopies are negative, or if there \nis a high clinical suspicion for a small lesion, enteroscopy and \nvideo capsule endoscopy are used to image the small bowel. \nD. There are multiple types of enteroscopy, including \n1. Push enteroscopy, in which a long endoscope (often a \ncolonoscope} is passed orally. \na. Visualization of 40--60 cm of jejunum is common. \nb. Diagnostic yields of 40-75% have been reported. \n2. Deep small bowel enteros1:opy (double balloon enteroscopy, \nsingle balloon enteroscopy, and spiral enteroscopy} can \nachieve visualization of the entire small bowel. \n3. lntraoperative endoscopy. \nE. Meckel diveniculum scan uses a nuclear tracer that binds to \nparietal cells. \n1. Sensitivity for detecting a Meckel diverticulurn is between \n75% and 100%. \n2. Diagnosis only really considered when obscure bleeding \noccurs in a patient younger than 30. \nTreatment \nThe treatment of obscure bleeding varies by the cause of bleeding. \nREFERENCES \nBarkun AN, BardouM, Kuipers EJ; International Consensus Upper Gastrointestinal \nBleeding Conference Group.

Howould you frame the \ndifferential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nHeadache is one of the most common physical complaints. \nBecause < 1 % of all headaches are life-threatening, the challenge is \nto reassure and appropriately treat patients with benign headaches \nwhile finding the rare, life-threatening headache without excessive \nevaluation. \nHeadaches are classified as primary or secondary. Primary head-\naches are syndromes unto themselves rather than signs of other \ndiseases. Although potentially disabling, they are reliably not \nlife-threatening. Secondary headaches are symptoms of other ill-\nnesses. Unlike primary headaches, secondary headaches are poten-\ntially dangerous. \nThe distinction between primary and secondary headaches is \nuseful diagnostically. Primary headaches, such as tension head-\naches, are diagnosed clinically, sometimes using diagnostic criteria \n(the most commonly used are published by the International \nHeadache Society, IHS). Traditional diagnostic srudies (laboratory \nstudies, radiology, pathology) cannot verify the diagnosis. Second-\nary headaches, such as headaches caused by central nervous system \n(CNS) tumors, often can be definitively diagnosed by identifying \nthe underlying disease of which the headache is a symptom. \nClinically, primary and secondary headaches can be difficult to \ndistinguish. The single most important question when developing \na differential diagnosis for a headache is, \"Is this headache ne\nor old?\" Chronic headaches tend to be primary, while new-onset \nheadaches are more likely to be secondary. This is the first and most \nimportant pivotal point in diagnosing headaches. This distinction \nis not perfect. There are some chronic headaches that are second-\nary headaches (headaches caused by cervical degenerative joint \ndisease for example) and even classic, primary headaches {such as \nmigraines) can present as a neheadache. The differentiation of \nold versus nealso depends on horapidly a patient brings his \nor her symptoms to medical attention. This being said, the classi-\nfication of headaches as primary versus secondary and neversus \nold provides not only a memorable framework for the differential \ndiagnosis but also a clinically useful suucrure by which the differ-\nential can be organized by pivotal points. The differential diagnosis \nappears below. Figure 20-1 shows the potential diagnoses in a more \nalgorithmic form as they are often considered clinically. The IHS's \nclassification website (https://www.ichd-3.org/) is also a terrific \nresource for an annotated differential diagnosis. \nA. Old headaches \n1. Primary \na. Tension headaches \nb.

She comes \nin nobecause while they used to occur 2-3 times a year, \nthey have become more frequent, occurring 3-4 times \na month. The headaches are so severe that she ls unable \nto work while experiencing one. She describes them as a \nthrobbing pain behind her right eye. (When describing the \nheadache, she places the base of her hand over her eye with \nher fingers wrapping over her forehead.) The headaches are \noften associated with nausea and, in the last femonths, \nshe has occasionally vomited with them. \nAt thle point, what le the lading hypothHle, \nwhat are the active altematlves, and Is \nthere a muet not miH dlagnoele? Given thle \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests &hould be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe severity and chronicity of the headaches are pivotal points in \nthis case that enable us to limit the differential. Ms. M's headaches \nare both severe headaches and old headaches. This fact is reassur-\ning, meaning that her headaches are most likely a primary head-\nache syndrome. In a young healthy person with chronic headaches, \nmigraine, tension, and cluster headaches are most likely. Given the \nseverity of the headaches, migraines are more likely than tension \nheadaches. Given the severe, throbbing nature of the headaches, a \nvascular cause should at least be considered. An intracranial aneu-\nrysm could cause similar symptoms, but the chronicity makes this \nless likely. Table 20-1 ranks the differential diagnosis considering \nthe demographic information, risk factors, symptoms and signs \navailable to us at this point. \n\nSeverity is less important than quality in \ndistinguishing a neheadache from an old \nheadache. A severe headache that is identical in \nquality to chronic headaches is less worrisome \nthan a mild headache that is dissimilar to any \nprevious headache. \nMs. M has used Ibuprofen in the past with good response. \nbut this Is no longer working well.

Patients often find it necessary to lie in a dark, \nquiet room. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The description of migraine headaches adopted by the IHS is, \n\"Recurring headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting \n4-72 hours. Typical characteristics of headache are unilateral \nlocation, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggra-\nvation by routine physical activity and association with nau-\nsea, and/or photophobia and phonophobia.\" \nB. Migraine headaches are a chronic headache syndrome caused \nby a neurovascular disorder. Neural events lead to intracranial \nvasodilatation. \nC. They may begin at any age but most commonly begin during \nadolescence. \nD. They are more common (2-3 times) and more severe in \nwomen than men. \nE. Auras can accompany migraines. \n1. About one-third of patients with migraines have auras. \n2. Auras are usually visual, precede the headache, and last for \nabout 20 minutes. \n3. Descriptions of auras \na. Frequently, patients initially describe a blind spot that \nis later accompanied by \"scintillating scotoma\" (flashing \nlights, spots of light, zigzag lines, or squiggles). \nb. Auras usually involve 1 ponion of the visual fldd. \nc. Common qualities of auras and their frequencies are \nlisted in Table 20-2. \n\n354 I CHAPTER 20 \nTable 20-2.

Listening \nclosely to patients with migraines describe their \naura will make it easy to recognize auras in \nother patients. \nEvidence--Based Diagnosia \nA. Migraine headaches are among the most severe of all the \nrecurrent headache syndromes. (Cluster headache is the other \nprimary headache that causes severe pain.) \n1. They should be considered in any patient with headaches \nsevere enough to be the chief concern at a doctor visit. \n2. Of initial visits for headaches in the primary care setting, \n90% meet criteria for migraines. \nThe diagnosis of migraine headache should be \nseriously considered in any patient who has \nrecurrent headaches that cause disability. \nB. As with other primary headaches, diagnosis is guided by the \nIHS's diagnostic criteria rather than by diagnostic tests. \nC. The criteria for migraines are divided into migraines with and \nwithout aura. \n1. Migraine without aura \na. A patient must have at least 5 attacks that last 4-72 \nhours. \nb. The headache must have 2 of the following qualities: \n(1) Unilateral pain \n(2) Pulsating pain \n(3) Moderate to severe pain intensity \n(4) Aggravated by (or cause avoidance of) routine \nphysical activity \nc. And have I of the following associated symptoms: \n(1) Nausea and/or vomiting \n(2) Photophobia or phonophobia \n2. Migraine with aura must have at least 2 attacks with the \nfollowing symptoms: \na. One or more fully reversible visual, sensory, speech, \nmotor, retinal or brainstem aura symptoms \nb. At least 2 of the following characteristics: \n(1) I aura symptom that develops gradually over \n5 minutes or 2 or more symptoms occurring in \nsuccession \n(2) Each individual aura symptom lasts 5-60 minutes \n(3) At least one unilateral aura symptom \n(4) An aura that is accompanied by a headache that \ndevdops within 60 minutes \nD. It is important to remember that diagnostic criteria, although \nhdpful, need to be used carefully when applied to an individ-\nual patient. A patient who clearly has the disease in question \nmay not perfectly flt the criteria. Consider these data about \nsome of classic migraine symptoms: \n1. 50% of patients with migraines have nonpulsatile \nheadaches. \n2. 40% have bilateral headaches. \nDiagnostic criteria are more helpful for \nresearch than patient care. They should be used \ncautiously with individual patients. \nE. There are other less common types of migraine. \n1. These include headaches with aura lasting> 60 minutes \nand migraine aura without a headache. \n2. These syndromes are difficult to diagnose and require \nexclusion of other diseases (such as cerebrovascular \naccident, transient ischemic attack, or retinal detachment) \nthat could cause similar symptoms. \nF. Besides the diagnostic criteria, there are many other aspects of \nthe history that are suggestive of migraine headaches. \n1. A systematic reviesuggested the mnemonic POUNDing \nas a diagnostic test for migraines. \nL Is the headache pulsatile? \nb. Does it last between 4 and 72 hours without \nmedications? \nc. Is it unilateral? \nd. Is there nausea? \ne. Is it disabling? \n2. If 4 or 5 questions are answered with \"Yes,\" the LR+ is 24, \nwhich rules in the diagnosis of migraine headache. \n3. Another revieprovided test characteristics for various \nheadache qualities in distinguishing migraines from tension \nheadaches. Table 20-3 shows those characteristics that have \nat least a moderate effect on posttest probability. \n4. When differentiating migraines from tension headaches, \nnausea is an important clue to migraines. \nS. Interestingly, some commonly considered characteristics, \nsuch as headache duration and rdationship of headache to \nstress, weather, menses, fatigue, and odors, were not helpful \nin differentiating migraines from tension headaches. \n6. Presence of a family history was hdpful in making the \ndiagnosis with an LR+ of 5.0. \n7. Patients with migraines are also more likely to have had \nvomiting attacks as children and to have suffered from \nmotion sickness. \n\nTable 20-3.

Given the severity of migraine, a common issue that comes \nup is whether a patient with a probable migraine requires \nneuroimaging. The following are predictors of abnormal neu-\nroimaging in patients with headaches and are generally agreed \nupon indications. \n1. Abnormal neurologic exam \n2. Symptoms that would be atypical for an aura, especially \ndizziness, lack of coordination, numbness or tingling, or \nworsening of headache with the Valsalva maneuver \n3. Increasing frequency of headaches or a change in headache \nquality or pattern \n4. Headaches that awaken patients from sleep \n5. Neheadaches in patients over 50 \n6. First headache, worst headache, or abrupt-onset headache \n7. Neheadache in patients with cancer, \nimmunosuppression, or pregnancy \n8. Headache associated with loss of consciousness \n9. Headache triggered by exertion \n10. Special consideration should be given to patients who are \nreceiving anticoagulants. \nTreatment \nA. Migraines treatment are either abortive or prophylactic. \nB. Abortive therapy \n1. Abortive therapy should be used at the very first sign of a \nmigraine. Patients should be advised not to wait until they \n\"are sure it is a migraine.\" \n2. Effective drugs are outlined in Table 20-4 with the individual \nconsiderations mainly from the consensus comments from \nthe US Headache Consortium. \nC. Prophylactic therapy \n1. While there are no clear guidelines about when to initiate \nprophylactic therapy, patients with more than 4 migraines a \nmonth or patients with debilitating or prolonged headaches \n(> 48 hours) should be considered for therapy. \nHEADACHE I 355 \nTable 20-4.

Prophylactic therapy does not need to be used every \nday. It can be used only around the times that migraines \npredictably occur (such as perimenstrually). \n4. There are many effective medications in multiple classes. \nSome of the most effective and commonly used are: \na. Beta-blockers \n(I) Propranolol \n(2) Metopolol \n(3) Tunolol \nb. Antidepressants \n(I) Amitriptyline \n(2) Venlafax.ine \nc.

They \nare pulsatile, unilateral, disabling, and associated with nausea, thus \nfulfilling 4 of the POUNDing criteria. The history of motion sick-\nness provides another clue. The increasing frequency and severity \nof the headaches is somewhat worrisome, and neurologic imaging \nwould be reasonable but not entirely necessary given the high pos-\nitive likelihood of the POUNDing criteria. \nHave you c;roeeed a diagnoetia threehold for \nthe lisading h)'pO\"thiseis, mfgralnis hisadachise? \nHavis you rulisd out this active alternatives? \nDo other ttlete nud to be done to mcc;ludtl this \nalternative diagnoses? \nAlternative Diagnosis: Tension Headaches \nTextbook Presentation \nTension headaches are the most common type of headache. They \ngenerally occur a fetimes each month and are described as \nbilateral and squeezing. They are usually relieved with over-the-\ncounter analgesics and are seldom severe enough to cause real \ndisability. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The IHS definition of episodic tension-type headache is, \n\"Recurrent episodes ofH/A lasting minutes to days. The pain \nis typically pressing/tightening in quality, of mild or moderate \nintensity, bilateral in location and does not worsen with rou-\ntine physical activity. Nausea is absent, but photophobia or \nphonophobia may be present.\" \nB. Most common type of headache; the 1-year prevalence of ten-\nsion headaches is 63% in men and 86% in women. \nC. The IHS criteria divide tension headaches into multiple sub-\ntypes: frequent or infrequent episodic, chronic, with or with-\nout associated tenderness of pericranial muscles. \nD. The pathophysiology of tension headaches is still a topic of \ndebate; episodic tension headaches are likely related to ten-\nderness and spasm in the pericranial muscles while chronic \ntension headaches are related to changes in the CNS and pain \npathways caused by the chronic pain of tension headaches. \nE. Tension headaches can be troublesome but are seldom disabling. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Because tension headaches are the most common form of \nheadaches, they are the default diagnosis in almost every \npatient with a mild to moderate headache syndrome. \nB. A detailed history and physical exam is required to exclude \nother headache syndromes that require specific treatment. \nC. Special attention should be given to excluding migraines. \nD. The IHS diagnostic criteria for infrequent or frequent episodic \ntension headaches are: \n1. At least 10 previous headaches (fewer than 2 per month is \ninfrequent, 2-14 per month is frequent) \n2. Duration of 30 minutes to 7 days \n3. 2 of the following characteristics must be present: \na. Pressing or tightening {nonpulsating) quality \nb. Mild to moderate in severity (inhibits but does not \nprevent activity) \nc. Bilateral \nd. Not aggravated by routine activity \n4. No nausea or vomiting \n5. Photophobia or phonophobia may be present, but \nnot both \nE. Chronic tension-type headaches often develop from the more \ncommon episodic headaches. These are similar in quality but \noccur at least 15 days of the month. \n1. Chronic tension-type headaches are commonly referred to \nchronic daily headaches. \n2. Chronic tension-type headaches may often be caused by \noveruse of analgesic drugs used to treat headaches. \nTreatment \nA. Episodic tension headaches \n1. Usually treated by patients without the input of a physician. \n2. Simple analgesics (acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are the basis of most \ntreatment. \n3. For more severe headaches, combinations of medications \nthat include caffeine can be used. \n4. In patients with frequent, but still episodic tension headaches, \nefforts at stress reduction including biofeedback are helpful. \nB. Chronic tension headaches \n1. These are often quite difficult to treat especially if they have \nbeen caused by medication overuse. \n2. When treating chronic tension headaches, an important \nintervention is \"detoxification,\" taking the patient off their \nlong-term pain medication regimen. \na. Long-term use of many headache medications has the \npotential to cause or exacerbate chronic tension headaches. \nb. The most common culprit medications are ergotamine, \ntriptans, NSAIDs, caffeine, and opioids. \nc. Detoxification can be difficult and occasionally requires \nhospitalization. \n3. While all previous medications are being withdrawn, the \naddition of an antidepressant and stress management, \neither alone or in combination, are effective. \na. Amitriptyline is considered first-line prophylactic \ntherapy for chronic tension headaches with mirtazapine \nas a second choice. \nb. Even a combination of both tricyclic antidepressants \nand stress management only reduces headache frequency \nand severity by about 50%. \nc. Physical therapy and acupuncture may offer some \nbenefit but the data are limited. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Cluster Headaches \nTatbook Presentation \nCluster headaches are severe headaches that occur in young men, \noften beginning in their 20s. The headache is unilateral, usually \noccurring around the eye or temporal region and is associated with \nipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, or \nrhinorrhea. Sufferers are often restless during attacks. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The prevalence of cluster headaches is about 0.1 %. They are \nmore common in men than women (4:1). \nB. The headaches are unilateral, severe, and are associated with \nautonomic findings related to both parasympathetic overactivity \nand sympathetic underactivity. \n\nC. Cluster headaches are generally brief, lasting from 15 minutes \nto 3 hours. \nD. The headaches occur in clusters with frequent headaches \noccurring for 6-12 weeks before a headache-free period. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Classic cluster headaches present in a memorable, stereotyp-\nical way. \nB. The IHS criteria for a cluster headache are: \n1. The patient must have at least 5 attacks. \n2. The headache must last 15-180 minutes; be severe; and be \ncharacteriu:d by unilateral pain that is orbital, supraorbital, \nor temporal. \n3. The headache is accompanied by at least 1 of the following: \na. Ipsilateral conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation \nb. Ipsilareral nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea \nc. Ipsilateral eyelid edema \nd. lpsilateral forehead and facial sweating \ne. Ipsilateral miosis and/or ptosis \nf. A sense of restlessness or agitation \n4. Attacks occur anywhere from every other day to 8/day \nduring a cluster. \nTreatment \nA. Treatment for cluster headaches is similar to the treatment for \nmigraines -\neither acute abonive or prophylactic therapies \nmaybe used. \nB. Abortive therapy \n1. High-flooxygen is the treatment with the least side effects \nand best evidence base. \n2. Triptans, similar to those used in the treatment of migraines, \nare also effective. \nC. Prophylactic therapy \n1. Verapamil is usually considered the first-line therapy for \npreventing cluster headaches. \n2. Corticosteroids and topiramate have also been used \nsuccessfully. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Headache due to \nUnruptured CNS Aneurysm \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation of a headache caused by a CNS aneu.ryi;m is \na new, unilateral and throbbing headache in a middle-aged patient. \nDisease Highlights \nA. CNS aneurysm may present in 3 ways. \n1. Asymptomatic detection: This commonly occurs when a \npatient has a ruptured aneurysm and another, nonruptured \naneurysm is found during the evaluation. \n2. Acute rupture or expansion (discussed later in this chapter) \n3. Chronic headache \nB. There are fesrudies of the chronic headaches caused by \nunruptured aneurysms. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The headaches of unruptured aneurysms are nonspecific. \nHEADACHE I 357 \n1. One study looked retrospectively at the symptoms of \n111 patients referred for therapy of unruptured aneurysms. \na. 54 of the patients had symptoms referable to the \naneu.ryi;m at the time of diagnosis. \nb. Of the 54 patients with symptoms, 35 (65%) had \nchronic symptoms. \nc. In 18 of these 35 patients, the chronic symptom was \nheadache without other neurologic signs. \nd. Patient's headaches were divided equally between \nunilateral and bilateral. \n2. A more n:cent study looked retrospectively at the symptoms \nof 5720 patients referred for therapy of unruprured \naneu.ryi;ms. \na. 47% of these patients had headaches or dizziness \nprompting the imaging studies. \nb. Female sex and larger aneurysms were associated with \nhigher risk of rupture. \nB. Neuroimaging \n1. CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are \nvery sensitive means of detecting CNS aneu.ryi;ms. \na. CT and MRI are both very sensitivity for aneurysms \n> 1 cm in diameter {99-100%). \nb. When considering all aneu.ryi;ms, CT is slightly more \nsensitive than MRI (90% vs 87% for MRI); MRI is \nmore specific (95% vs 86%). \nc. CT and MRI are not sensitive for detecting aneu.ryi;ms \n< 3 mm {CT, 61%; MRI, 38%). \n2. Traditional angiography \na. Considered the gold standard for diagnosis \nb. Usually required prior to repair \nTreatment \nA. The treatment of CNS aneurysms can be accomplished with \nneurosurgical or endovascular procedures. \nB. Repair of aneurysms < 1 cm in a patient who has not had a \nprevious rupture is generally not recommended since the rup-\nrure rates are so low. \nC. Management decisions are difficult in a patient with a small \naneu.ryi;m and a suspicious headache because there is no defin-\nitive way to knowhether the aneurysm is causing the head-\nache prior to surgery. \n\nBecause t he qualit y of Ms. M's headaches had not chal'l{jed \nat all, the decision was made not to image her brain. She \nwas given long-acting propranolol at 80 mg/day as a pro-\nphylactic medicat ion and prescribed oral sumatrlptan to \nbe us&! as needed as abortive t herapy. At a 1-mont h fol-\nlow-up, t he patient reported only a sitl{jle mild headache for \nwhich she used ibuprofen. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nThe decision to forgo imaging was difficult. Although the like-\nlihood of finding another cause of headaches was small, the fre-\nquency of the patient's headaches had changed. Her complete \nresponse to migraine prophylaxis is diagnostic. \n\n358 I CHAPTER 20 \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. L is a 65-year-old woman who comes to an outpa-\ntient clinic complaining of headaches. She reports waking \nup almost every momlng with a moderate to severe, bltem-\nporal headache. She reports never having headaches of any \nconsequence In the past l:n.it has been quite troubled for the \nlast 2 months. \nAt thl9 point. what J9 the lading hypothe9le, \nwhat are the active alternatives, and le there a \nmuet not miee diagnoeie? Given thie diffisrential \ndlagnoele, what teete ehould be ordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMrs. r:s headaches are of concern because she is older and the head-\naches are new. Her age and the acuity of the headaches are pivotal \nfeatures that limit the differential diagnosis. Both these features \nraise the likelihood that the headaches are secondary and, therefore, \npotentially dangerous. Morning headaches are classically associated \nwith brain tumors. Edema forms around the CNS lesion while the \npatient is supine at night leading to headaches &om increased intra-\ncranial pressure in the morning. Further history is needed because \nbrain tumors are most likdy in patients with other types of cancer. \nMorning headaches are also a fairly common symptom of many \nhabits, diseases, and exposures. Headaches associated with sub-\nstances or their withdrawals are a common cause of morning head-\naches. Alcohol, caffeine, and carbon monoxide are probably the \nmost common. Morning headaches are frequently the symptoms \nof diseases that are active at night or that disturb sleep. Nighttime \nhypoglycemia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are common \ncauses of headaches in this category. Tension headaches should \nalways be in the differential of headaches and may, on occasion, \ncause morning headaches. \nThe presence of a new, bitemporal headache in an older patient \nshould raise the possibility of temporal arteritis. Although these \nheadaches are not classically morning headaches, they should still \nbe considered. Temporal arteritis will be discussed later in the \nchapter. Table 20-5 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nEven more than with most headaches, a careful \nhistory is necessary in a patient with morning \nheadaches. \nMrs. L reports otherwise feeling well. She says the head-\naches occur nearly every moming, irrespective of day of \nthe week or whether she has slept at home or at her week-\nend house. She denies neurologlc symptoms, such as focal \nnumbness, weakness, or visual disturbances. She denies \nsnoring or excessive daytime somnolence. She read on an \nInternet site that new-onset, moming headaches are clas-\nsic for brain tumors and she is very nervous. \nHer medical history is notal71e only for noninsulin-\ndependent diabetes mellttus, which has always been under \ngood control. She reports no recent change In her diet, \nweight. or medication. \nMedications are 325 mg/day of aspirin, 10 mg/day \norally of atorvastatin, and 5 mg of oral glyburide taken \ntwice daily. \n~ \nle the clinical information eufficient to make \n1~r a dfagnoeie? If not, what other information do \nyounsed? \nMany patients seeking care fur a headache \nbdieve they have a brain tumor. It is important \nto recognize this-a little definitive reassurance \ncan go a long way. \nTable 20-5.

Brain turners are classified as metastatic, primary extra-axial, \nand primary intra-axial. \nB. The relative frequencies of types of tumors within each type \nare listed below: \n1. Metastatic \na. Lung, 37% \nb. Breast, 19% \nc. Melanoma, 16% \n2. Primary extra-axial \na. Meningioma, 80% \nb. Acoustic neuroma, 10% \nc. Pituitary adenoma, 7% \n3. Primary intra-axial \na. Glioblastoma, 47% \nb. Astrocytoma, 39% \nC. Metastatic tumors are about 7 times more common than pri-\nmary cumors. (Thus, a neheadache in a patient with known \nmalignancy should be taken very seriously.) \nD. Intracranial neoplasms generally present with seizure; focal \nneurologic signs; or signs of increased intracranial pressure, \nsuch as headache. \nE. Although the presenting symptoms vary with type of rumor, \nthe most common symptoms are \n1. Headache {about 50% of the time) \n2. Seizure \n3. Hemiparesis \n4. Change in mental status \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \n1. The history of a patient's headache is not particularly \nhelpful in making a diagnosis of intracranial neoplasms. \n2. One very good report retrospectively studied 85 patients \nwith brain tumors. The symptoms were nonspecific. \na. 60% of patients had headaches. \nb. Only 2% of patients had headache as the solitary \npresenting feature \nc. 40 patients had precxisting headache disorders but 82.5% \nof these patients had a change in their headache pain \nd. Only 6% were associated with laying supine {a \nsymptom classically ascribed to brain turners). \ne. 40% of patients met the criteria for tension headaches. \nf. Headaches were frequently dull of moderate intensity \nand pain was controlled with nonopiate pain \nmedications. \nIn patients without a history of cancer, brain \ntumors almost never present as an isolated \nheadache. \nHEADACHE I 359 \nBrain tumor headaches are nonspecific. A \npatient with a neheadache and a preexisting \ncancer that could potentially metastasize to the \nCNS should undergo imaging. \nB. Neuroimaging \n1. Contrast-enhanced CT \na. A reasonable choice for screening patients in whom \nthere is a losuspicion. \nb. The sensitivity of a contrast-enhanced CT for \nintracranial neoplasm is around 90%. \n2. MRI with contrast is the procedure of choice for imaging \nbrain tumors. The sensitivity of MRI is nearly 100%, and \nthe detail provided often suggests a likely pathology. \nTreatment \nA. The treatment of brain tumors depends on the pathology. \nB. Importantly, patients with signs of increased intracranial pres-\nsure or seizure should be hospitalized immediately enabling \nboth rapid diagnosis and treatment. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMrs. L's physical exam, includi~ a detailed neurologic exam. \nis normal. laboratory test s done on the day of the visit \nrevealed a normal CBC, nonnal chem-7, and a ~lycosylated \nHb of 5.9% (down from 7% 3 mont hs earlier). A noncon-\ntrast head CT done on the day of t he visit was normal. \nHave you crossed a dlagn05tlc thresholc:i \nfor the leading hypotheele, lntracranlal \nneoplasms? Have you ruled out the active \naltematives? Do othsr tests nsed to t1s dons \nto tJ>Ccluds ths altematlvs dlagnotHHii1 \nGiven that intracranial neoplasms are rare in patients without \npreexisting cancers and the presence of morning headaches is \na nonspeciflc finding, it is unlikely that the patient has a brain \ntumor. The noncontrast head CT was probably a reasonable test \nto do. Although it is not as sensitive as a contrast-enhanced study, \nwith the lopretest probability it effectively rules out a tumor \nand, given the patient's concern, it was an effective method of \nreassuring her. \nAfter the normal CT and unrevealing laboratory test results, \nattention must be turned to possible exposures or the \"second-\nary morning headaches.\" The patient's marked drop in her gly-\ncosylated Hb and early morning hypoglycemia are suggestive of \na diagnosis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Morning Headaches \nas Symptoms of Other Diseases \nTextbook Presentation \nVarious diseases can cause headaches that occur predominantly in \nthe morning. The headaches are generally worst upon awakening \nand then improve as the day progresses. Classically, the more com-\nmon symptoms of the underlying disease (daytime hypoglycemia \nwith overly controlled diabetes mellicus or daytime somnolence \nwith OSA) are present. \n\n360 I CHAPTER 20 \nDisease Highlights \nA. The most rigorously defined morning headaches are those \ncaused by disturbed sleep. The sleep disturbance can be of \nalmost any etiology. \n1. Primary sleep disturbance \na. OSA \nb. Periodic leg movement of sleep (PLMS) \n2. Abnormal sleep duration \na. Excessive sleep \nb. Interrupted sleep \nc. Sleep deprivation \n3. Secondary to another disease \na. Chronic pain \nb. Depression \nB. Hypoglycemia that occurs while asleep or awake can cause \nheadaches. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The attribution of morning headaches to another disease \ndepends on the recognition of the underlying disease, its \ntreatment, and the response of the presenting headache. \nB. Recognition of the OSA and nighttime hypoglycemia can be \ndifficult since clinical clues are nonspecific. \n1. Clinical predictors of OSA arc poor (See Chapter 18, \nFatigue). Polysornnography is diagnostic and will also provide \ninformation about PLMS and, sometimes, insomnia related \nto chronic pain. \nA sleep study is a reasonable diagnostic test in a \npatient with morning headaches and no readily \napparent cause. \n2. Nighttime hypoglycemia should be considered in any \npatient with morning headaches who is treated for \ndiabetes. Abnormal nocturnal glucose readings and \nresolution of headaches with achievement of euglycemia \nare diagnostic. \nTreatment \nThe treatment of morning headaches depends on the cause. \nA. Nighttime hypoglycemia: improve management of diabetes \nmellitus \nB. OSA: Continuous positive airway pressure \nC. PLMS: Carbidopa and lcvodopa \nD. Pain syndromes: Improve pain control \nAlternative Diagnosis: Headaches Associated \nwith Substances or Their Withdrawal \nTatbook Presentation \nThese are headaches that occur in close temporal relation to sub-\nstance exposure or substance withdrawal. They resolve when the \nculprit substance is no longer used. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Many substances can cause headaches acutely, with long-term \nuse, or after their withdrawal. \n1. Acute exposure \na. Nitrites (\"hot dog headache) \nb. Carbon monoxide \n2. Long-term exposure (analgesics) \n3. Withdrawal from acute exposure (alcohol) \n4. Withdrawal from chronic exposure \na. Caffeine \nb. Opioids \nc. Multiple other medications including estrogen, \ncorticosteroids, tricyclic antidepressants, selective \nserotonin reuptake inhibitors, and NSAIDs. \nB. Of these headaches, caffeine withdrawal, hangovers, and car-\nbon monoxide poisoning are probably the most common or \nimportant causes of morning headaches. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Medication overuse headaches \n1. Headache occurring on 15 or more days per month as a \nconsequence of overusing a headache medication for more \nthan 3 months. \n2. Headaches usually resolve when the medication overuse is \nstopped. \nB. Caffeine withdrawal headaches \n1. The IHS criteria require that: \na. Patients drink ~ 200 mg of caffeine daily for > 2 weeks. \nb. The headaches occur within 24 hours of the last caffeine \nintake and are relieved within I hour by 100 mg of caffeine. \nc. That the headache resolves within 7 days of total \ncaffeine withdrawal. \n2. An average cup of coffee contains about 100 mg of \ncaffeine. \n3. Premium coffees may contain significantly more. A 12-oz \n(tall) coffee at Starbucks contains 260 mg of caffeine. \n4. The average adult American ingests approximately 280 mg \nof caffeine each day. \nS. Caffeine withdrawal should be suspected if headaches seem \nto occur when coffee intake changes, such as on weekends \nand during vacations. \nCaffeine withdrawal should be considered \nwhen headaches occur when patients sleep later \nthan usual or occur mainly on weekends or \nvacations. \nC. Carbon monoxide poisoning \n1. Presentation runs the specuum from mild headache to \nheadache with nausea, vomiting, and anxiety to coma and \ncardiovascular collapse. \n2. Historical features that increase the suspicion of this \ndiagnosis. \na. A patient's headache only occurs in a single location \nand resolves when the patient is removed from this \nsetting. \nb. Multiple people in same setting (family members, \nroommates) have similar symptoms. \nc. Carbon monoxide poisoning is most common in \nthe winter. \n3. An elevated carboxyhemoglobin level makes the \ndiagnosis. Routine arterial blood gas measurements \n\nand pulse oximetry do not detect carbon monoxide \npoisoning. \nTreatment \nBecause carbon monoxide poisoning is poten-\ntially life-threatening, the diagnosis should be \nconsidered whenever a patient has a potentially \nconsistent history. \nA. Treatment of headaches associated with substances or their \nwithdrawal depends on the substance. \nB. Patients with headaches from carbon monoxide poisoning \nshould be removed from their house while the source is repaired. \nC. Patients with caffeine withdrawal headaches should \neither be weaned off caffeine or counseled on the need \nto continue regular use (an option generally preferred by \nmedical students). \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. J is a 27-year-old man who arrives at his primary care \nphysician's office complaining of a headache. He has a long \nhistory of mild tension-type headaches managed with acet-\naminophen. Three days ago, a severe headache suddenly \ndeveloped while he was weight lfftlng. He describes th Is head-\nache as the \"worst headache of his life:' The headache slowly \nresolved over about 2 hours. He is nofeeling completely \nwell. He has 1:7een afraid to exercise since this headache. \nAt this point. what is the leading hypothesis, \nwhat aNJ the active altematives, and is \nthsNJ a muet not miH diagnoele? Given thle \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests should .be \nordel'tld? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nBoth the acuity and severity of this headache are worrisome and \npivotal. The onset during exercise is also concerning. This type of \nheadache, one that begins at its peak intensity, is referred to as a \nthunderclap headache. \nLimiting the differential based on the pivotal points of the \nheadache being neand of hyperacute onset, SAH is the leading \nhypothesis and must not miss diagnosis. His designation of the \nheadache as the \"worst headache of his life\" is classic for SAH, \nalthough the resolution of the pain is not typical. Other headaches \ncan present in a similar fashion. Benign thunderclap headache is \na rare headache syndrome that is clinically indistinguishable from \nSAH. Headaches due to cough, exertion, and sexual activity are \nprimary headache syndromes that may mimic SAH. A parenchy-\nmal hemorrhage is possible but unlikely given the patient's age and \nabsence of a history of hypertension. \nThere are some rare diseases that can occasionally present \nwith a thunderclap headache; these include cerebral venous sinus \nthrombosis, pituitary apoplexy, carotid dissection, and spontane-\nous intracranial hypotension from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. \nTable 20-6 lists the differential diagnosis. \nHEADACHE I 361 \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nThe patient was asked to set her alann and check a finger-\nstick glucose at 2 AM. Her reading was 42 mg/dl . \nA tentative diagnosis of moming headaches due to noc-\nturnal hypoglycemia was made. The patient was advised \nnot to take t he evening dose of glyburide; her headaches \nresolved t he next day. At her next vlslt, the patient's medi-\ncations were Inspected. The label on t he bottle was correct, \n1:7ut inspection of the pills revealed t hat 10-mg pills had \nbeen mistakenly dispensed, doubling her dose. \nAdverse effects of medications are common. Although most com-\nmonly intrinsic to the medication, they can also be related to inap-\npropriate prescribing or incorrect dispensing. \nA headache that starts abruptly and reaches its \nmaximal severity within seconds (a thunderclap \nheadache) should be assumed to be caused by \nan SAH until proven otherwise. \n\nMr. J's past medical history is notal:lle only for mild asthma \nfor which he uses all:7uterol as needed. \nOn physical exam, he appears well and not in any dis-\ntress. His vital signs are temperature, 36.9C; pulse, 82 \n1:7pm; BP, 112/82 mm Hg; RR. 14 breaths per minute. His \nneck Is supple and detalled neurologlc exam Is also nonnal. \n~ \nIs the clinical information sufficient to maks a \n1~r dlagno9l9f If not, what othsr Information do \nyou need? \nTable 20-6.

Patients may also lose consciousness. If the \npatient is alert at the time of medical assessment, focal neurologic \nsigns and meningismus may be present on the physical exam. \nDisease Highlights \nA. SAH is primarily caused by rupture of a saccular aneurysm in \nor near the circle ofWillis (- 85%). \nB. Aneurysms are present in about 7% of the population. \nC. Large aneurysms (> 1 cm) rupture at a rate of about 0.5%/year. \nD. The vast majority of ruptures occur in persons 40-65 years old. \nE. SAH carries a mortality of about 50%. \nF. Sentinel headaches are atypical headaches that occur in the \nweeks preceding SAH. \n1. They are thought to be caused by the expansion of, or a small \nleak from, an aneurysm prior to a more catastrophic bleed. \n2. There is controversy as to whether these are a true \nphenomenon. \nEvidence--Based Diagnosil \nA. Pretest probability \n1. SAH accounts for 1-4% of headaches presenting to the \nemergency department. \n2. The following findings are common in patients in whom \nSAH is ultimately diagnosed. (Prevalence figures are \nestimates from 2 large srudies.} \na. Headache, 90% \nb. In patients presenting with headache, 82.4% report a \nthunderclap headache, and 99.2% reported the worst \nheadache of their life. \nc. Stiff neck, 75% \nd. Change in mental status, 60% \ne. Stupor or coma, 27% \nB. Diagnostic tests \n1. The Ottawa SAH Rules are helpful to rule out SAH \n(100% sensitivity, 13.6% specific) in acute nontraumatic \nheadaches. \n2. Patients can be considered free of SAH if they lack all of \nthe following: \na. Symptoms of neck pain or stiffness \nb. Age > 40 years \nc. Onset during exertion \nd. Thunderclap headache \ne. Limited neck flexion upon exam \n3. The initial diagnostic test is a noncontrast head CT. The \nsensitivity of this test varies with the time since the onset \nof symptoms. \na. First 12 hours, 97% \nb. 12-24 hours, 93% \nc. Falls to as loas 80% after 2 weeks \n4. Next to angiography, CSF examination for RBCs and \nxanthochromia (the result of first oxyhemoglobin and later \nbilirubin from deteriorating RBCs) is the most accurate \ndiagnostic method. \na. RBCs are seen immediately in the CSF in 100% of \npatients. The specificity, however, can be limited by \ntraumatic lumbar punctures. \nb. Sensitivity of RBCs begins to fall after about 24 hours. \nc. Spectrophotometric detection of xanthochromia is \n100% specific for SAH. \nd. Most experts suggest delaying the lumbar puncture for \n6-12 hours after the onset of a headache (if clinically \nsafe) in a patient with a suspicious headache and normal \nCT scan since it takes 12-24 hours for the sensitivity to \nreach nearly 100%. \ne. The sensitivity of xanthochromia remains at 100% for \nover 1 week. \n5. In all patients with documented SAH, angiography is \nperformed to assist in surgical planning. Angiography \nmight also be done for patients in whom the diagnosis is \nunclear even after lumbar puncture. \nC. Importance of correct diagnosis \n1. About 25% of patients with SAH are initially misdiagnosed. \n2. Patients with less severe clinical presentations are most \ncommonly misdiagnosed. \n3. Patients who are initially misdiagnosed are only about half \nas likely to have a good or excellent outcome. \nTreatment \nAll patients in whom SAH is suspected should \nundergo a noncontrast head CT. If the CT is \nnormal, a lumbar puncture should be performed \nin any patient with more than a minimal pretest \nprobability. \nA. Prevention of rebleeding \n1. The primary treatment of a SAH is to occlude the culprit \naneurysm to prevent rebleeding. \n2. This is usually accomplished by deploying platinum coils \nvia arterial catheters within the aneurysm to cause occlusion. \n3. Neurosurgical clipping of aneurysms is nosecond-line \ntherapy. \nB. Prevention of cerebral vasospasm and resulting ischemia \n1. The cause of cerebral vasospasm is poorly understood \nbut is predicted by the size of the hemorrhage and loss of \nconsciousness at the time of hemorrhage. \n2. Calcium antagonists, primarily nimodipine, decrease the \nrisk of vasospasm. \nC. Management of hydrocephalus \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nThe patient had a thunderclap headache that he describes as the \nworst headache of his life, which mandates urgent evaluation. \n\nMr. J is referred from the clinic for a noncont rast head CT. \nThe results are normal. \nHave you croeeed a diagnostic thre5hold for the \nleading hyPOthseie, 5AH? Have you rulsd out \nth111 active atternatlvn? Do othlllrteete 11111111t.1 to \nbe done to e><elude the atternatlWJ diagnosee? \n\nAlternative Diagnoses: Primary Cough \nHeadache, Primary Exertional Headache, & \nHeadache Associated with Sexual Activity \nTextbook Presentation \nThese headaches are primary headaches precipitated by cough, \nexertion (usually involving the Valsalva maneuver), and sexual \nactivity. They may mimic SAH. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Cough headaches \n1. More common in men (-3:1) \n2. More common in older patients (mean age, 67) \n3. Last < 1 minute \nB. Exertional headaches \n1. More common in men (-90%) \n2. Occurs in young people (mean age, 24) \n3. Often bilateral and throbbing \n4, Sometimes related to migraines (some patients may induce \nmigraines with physical activity) \nS. Last from 5 minutes to 24 hours \nC. Sexual headaches \n1. Also more common in men (-85%) \n2. Mean age, 41 \n3. Last < 3 hours \n4. Can occur as 3 types \na. Dull type: dull headache worsening with sexual \nexcitement \nb. Explosive type: SAH-like headache occurring at \norgasm \nc. Postural type: postural headache developing after \ncoitus \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Although these headaches may be indistinguishable from more \nconcerning headaches, the clinical presentation can sometimes \nhelp identify the diagnosis. \nB. They should be considered when the headache starts with \ncough, sexual activity, or exercise. \nC. One reviesuggested other distinguishing features. \n1. Cough headaches \na. Either represent a primary headache syndrome or \nsymptoms of an Arnold-Chiari type I malformation in \nwhich the cerebellar tonsils protrude out of the base of \nthe skull \nb. Headaches lasting > 30 minutes are usually secondary \nto a Chiari type I malformation and occur in younger \npatients. \n2. Sexual headaches \na. Almost always (93%) benign \nb. Patients with benign sexual headaches tended to have \nmultiple episodes of the headache. \n3. Exertional headaches \na. Represent either the primary headache syndrome or \nsecondary headaches (causes include SAH and brain \ntumor). \nHEADACHE I 363 \nb. Primary exertional headaches are generally \nindistinguishable from secondary exertional headaches. \nTreatment \nBecause exertlonal headaches are clinically \nindistinguishable from SAH, a patient pre-\nsenting with such a headache must be carefully \nevaluated to rule out the latter. \nA. Cough headaches are effectively treated with cough suppression \nandNSAIDs. \nB. Exertional headaches are treated by avoiding strenuous activity \n{especially in hot weather or at high altitudes) or by using pre-\nexertion ergotamine, beta-blockers, or NSAIDs. \nC. Sexual headaches are effectively treated with prophylactic \nbeta-blockers. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Benign ThundeKlap \nHeadache \nTextbook Presentation \nThe presentation of benign thunderclap headaches is indistin-\nguishable from SAH. The diagnosis is made after normal results \nare obtained on CT scan and lumbar puncture. These headaches \noccasionally recur in an unpredictable way. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Primary headache syndrome \nB. Clinically indistinguishable from SAH but lacks any associated \nneurologic symptoms or signs. \nC. Headaches frequently recur over 1-2 weeks and then intermit-\ntently over years. \nD. In the best study of these headaches: \n1. SAH developed in none of the 71 patients studied. \n2. Headaches generally lasted from 8 to 72 hours. \n3. 51 (72%) of the patients had their headaches unrelated to \ncough, sexual activity, or exertion. \n4. 17% of the patients had recurrent, similar headaches. \nE. In 2018, a case report was published relating a thunderclap \nheadache to ingestion of the \"hottest pepper in the world.\" \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Benign thunderclap headaches are diagnosed when there is a \nsuspicious clinical presentation and SAH is ruled out. \nB. Given the poor prognosis of SAH, CT scan and lumbar punc-\nture should be performed in all patients prior to making this \ndiagnosis. \nTreatment \nBecause benign thunderclap headaches are \nclinically indistinguishable from SAH, they can \nonly be diagnosed after SAH has been ruled out. \nA. Treatment is challenging because these headaches are short-\nlived and intermittent. \nB. As-needed analgesics are probably the only reasonable \ntherapy. \n\n364 I CHAPTER 20 \nAlternative Diagnosis: lntracerebral \nHemorrhage \nTextbook Presentation \nlntracerebral hemorrhage (hemorrhagic stroke) generally presents \nin older, hypertensive patients with acute-onset headache and focal \nneurologic symptoms and signs. \nDisease Higblighu \nA. lntracerebral hemorrhage accounts for about 10% of strokes, \nbeing less common than embolic and thrombotic strokes. \nB. Hypertension is the most common cause, followed by amyloid \nangiopathy, saccular aneurysm rupture, and arteriovenous \nmalformation rupture. \nC. Among patients with hypenension, Asians and blacks have the \nhighest risk of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents. \nD. In young patients (< age 40) without hypertension, diseases \nsuch as arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm rupture, and \ndrug use should be considered. \nEvidence--Based Diagnosil \nA. Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage usually have headache \nand focal neurologic signs. \nB. A thunderclap-type headache is the presenting sign in nearly \n60% of patients. \nC. Vomiting is present in about 50% of patients, and seizures are \npresent in about 10%. \nD. Noncontrast CT and MRI are equally accurate in making \nthis diagnosis with sensitivities of nearly 100%. MRI may be \nbetter at detecting hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic \nstrokes. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. T is an 00-year-old woman who comes to your office \ncomplaining of headaches for the past 3 months. She \nreports always having had mild headaches that never trou-\nbled her enough to see a doctor. This headache has been \npersistent, 1:1ilateral, 1:1ancl-llke, and throl:11:11ng. \nAt her present visit, she reports no visual changes, no \nrecent head trauma, and no neurologlc deficits. She does \nreport fatigue and says that she has lost about 15 lbs over \nthe last month. She denies jasymptoms. \nHer past medical history is notable for hypertension \nfor which she takes losartan. morbid obesity, and a breast \nmass noted 2 years before. The mass was thought to be lo\nsuspicion for malle nancy and the patient declined work-up. \n~ \nAt thle point, what le the leading hypotheele, \n1~J\"\" what are the active aiternatlWIS, and le there a \nmuet not mlee dlagno91e7 Glvsn this differential \ndiagnO&ie, what tntl!l ehould be ordenk.17 \nTreatment \nSee the Treatment section under Cerebellar Hemorrhage in \nChapter 14, Dizziness. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nGiven the acute-onset durlrl{l exercise, the normal neuro-\nl09ic exam, and the lack of symptoms during the intervenirl{l \n3 days, the patient was thought to have primary exertional \nheadache. A sent inel headache, preceding a SAH. however, \nwas a must not miss alternative. Given this. the patient \nunderwent lumbar puncture t hat revealed no RBCs and \nno xanthochromia. He subsequent ly experienced a similar \nheadache 2 weeks later with exercise. He was then treated \nwith preexerclse propranolol with good response. \nThis patient received the appropriate evaluation. Although he was \nfeeling well at the time of the visit, the test threshold for SAH needs \nto be very logiven the severity of disease. SAH tends to be misdi-\nagnosed in patients with the mildest symptoms. This is because the \nphysician's suspicion is lowest in these patients and because the CT \nscan may be less sensitive in people with presumably small hemor-\nrhages. Accurate diagnosis of these patients is highly desirable since \nthey potentially have the best outcomes. \nWith a normal CT scan and lumbar puncrure, the diagnosis \nbecomes either benign thunderclap headache or benign exertional \nheadache. The difference is likely semantic, but the headache's \nonset and recurrence during exercise makes benign exertional \nheadache the diagnosis. Intracerebral bleed from an arteriovenous \nmalformation was a possibility but was ruled out with the normal \nCTscan. \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThis presentation is of concern because the patient is elderly, she \nhas a neheadache, and she has experienced weight loss. The dif-\nferential diagnosis must take into account these pivotal points (age, \nsubacute onset, and constitutional symptoms). The persistence \nof the headache probably excludes diagnoses such as intracere-\nbral hemorrhage or infections. As we explore the limited differ-\nential diagnosis for this patient, the patient's sex: and obesity are \nimponant. \nTemporal arteritis and malignancy are both possible given the \npatient's age and subacute presentation. The throbbing nature of \nthe pain and weight loss could certainly be consistent with either \nof these types of headache. The history of a breast mass has to \nmake metastatic disease a real consideration. Subdural hematoma \nis possible, but the lack of a history of head trauma or use of anti-\ncoagulation medications makes this less likely. Although a diag-\nnosis of tension headaches should be given with extreme caution \nin an elderly person with neheadaches, the persistent band-like \ndescription raises this possibility. A neheadache in a woman with \nobesity also raises the possibility of idiopathic intracranial hyper-\ntension. This disease is more commonly seen in young women. \nTable 20-7 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nTable 20-7.

An \nESR done at that visit was 56 mm/h. \n~~ Is ths cllnical information sufficient to make a \n,~r dlagno9f9? If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Temporal Arteritis \nTextbook Presentation \nTemporal arteritis classically presents in women over age SO as a \nbilateral, throbbing headache. Japain and fatigue with chew-\ning Qaclaudication) may be present. There may be a history of \npolymyalgia rheumatica or consistent symptoms (shoulder and hip \ngirdle pain) and the physical exam can reveal beading and tender-\nness of the temporal arteries. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate \n(ESR) is almost always devated. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Temporal (or giant cell) arteritis is a corticosteroid-responsive \nvasculitis of large arteries. \nHEADACHE I 365 \nB. It primarily involves the vessds of the aortic arch, particularly \nthe external carotid. \nC. It affects people over age SO, women more commonly \nthan men. \nD. Although the most common presentation is a neheadache, \ntemporal arteritis can present with nonspeciflc manifestations \nof a chronic inflammatory disorder. \n1. Fever \n2. Anemia and thrombocytopenia \n3. Fatigue \n4. Weight loss \n5. Elevated ESR or C-reactive protein \nTemporal arteritls is in the differential diagno-\nsis for older people presenting with nonspedfic \ninflammatory conditions. \nE. It can also present with specific complications of the disease. \n1. Jadaudication \n2. Blindness (secondary to ophthalmic artery vasculitls) \nF. Related to polymyalgia rheumatica \n1. 15% of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica have \ntemporal arteritis. \n2. As many as SO% of patients with temporal arteritis have \npolymyalgia rheumatica. \nG. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent vasculi-\ntis-associated thrombosis in the affected vessds. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Clinical findings \n1. The clinical signs and symptoms of temporal arteritis are \nnot highly predictive. \n2. Two systematic reviews presented test characteristics for \nmany of the commonly cited findings. These are outlined \nin Table 20-8. \n3. A fecombinations of signs and symptoms have been \nfound to have very high positive LRs. \na. Headache and jaclaudication: LR+, 8.0 \nb. Scalp tenderness and jaclaudication: LR+, 17.0 \nTable 20-8.

Reflecting the poor performance of clinic:al predictors, only \n30--40% of patients referred fur temporal artery biopsy \nhave the disease. \nBecause the clinic:al signs and symptoms of \ntemporal arteritis are not highly predictive, \ntemporal artery biopsy should be used in any \npatient in whom the clinical suspicion is even \nmoderate. \nB. ESR has been used to \"rule out\" temporal arteritis. \n1. The sensitivity of an abnormal ESR is 95%. \n2. The test charac:teristic:s of the ESR at various c:ut points are \nshown below. [A normal ESR is usually considered to be \nless than age/2 in men and (age + 10)/2 in women.] \na. Abnormal: LR+, 1.1; LR-, 0.2 \nb. ESR > SO mm/h: LR+, 1.2; LR-, 0.35 \nc. ESR > 100 mm/h: LR+, 1.9; LR-, 0.8 \nC. Temporal artery ultrasound \n1. Ultrasound has been used as a diagnostic: tool. \n2. Inflamed arteries have a hypoec:hoic: halo around \nthe lumen. \n3. Most studies have found this finding to be insensitive and \nnot specific enough to avoid biopsy. \nD. Temporal artery biopsy \n1. Considered the gold standard fur diagnosing temporal \narteritis. \n2. Given the difficulty of clinically diagnosing temporal \narteritis and the common side effects of the treatment, \ntemporal artery biopsy is always recommended to establish \nthe diagnosis of temporal arteritis. \n3. Although biopsy should be done as quic:kly as possible \nonce the disease is suspected, a short delay after \nbeginning treatment (-7 days) probably does not affect \nthe results. \nTreatment of temporal arteritis should not be \ndelayed to perform a biopsy in a patient in \nwhom temporal arteritis is suspected. \n4. There are cases of biopsy-negative temporal arteritis. One \nmuch quoted study gave the following test charac:teristic:s \nfor temporal artery biopsy: \na. Sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 100% \nb. LR+, oo LR-, 0.15 \nTreatment \nEven in the setting of a negative temporal artery \nbiopsy, a patient with very high suspicion fur \ntemporal arteritis should be monitored closely, \nre-biopsied at a different site, or treated. \nA. The treatment of temporal arteritis is conic:osteroids. \n1. Should be staned immediately in a patient in whom \ntemporal arteritis is suspected. \n2. Can be tapered slowly once there has been clinic:al remission \nas long as the inflammatory markers (ESR, C-reactive protein) \nremain depressed. \nB. Methotrexate might be an option in patients who have recurrent \ndisease upon withdrawal of corticosteroids. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nPhysical exam was notable for vital signs of tempera-\nture, 37.1C; BP, 130/82 mm H!:!: pulse, 72 bpm; RR. \n10 breaths per minute. Head and neck exam revealed prom-\ninence of the temporal arteries. Cataract s llmtted the fun-\ndoscoplc examination. Heart, lun!:!. and abdomlnal exams \nwere normal. Breast exam revealed a 2 x 3 cm mass in t he \nleft breast that was soft and freely mobile, which seemed \nunchan!:!ed from a description in the patient's chart from \n2 years earlier. Extremity exam was notable for bruises \nover her left elboand shoulder from a fall. Neurolo!:!IC exam \nIs fully Intact. \nHaWJ you cros5ed a dlagno5tlc threshold for \nthe leading hypothe&ls, temporal arterltls1 \nHave you ruled out the active alternativea1 \nDo other teets need to be done to exclude ths \naltemative dlagnoees1 \nTemporal arteritis certainly remains high on the differential diagno-\nsis. Her headache and physic:al exam are both suspicious. Assuming \na pretest probability of about 40% (the usual percentage of positive \nbiopsies among people in whom temporal arteritis is suspected}, \nthe prominence of her temporal arteries (LR+, 2) increases the like-\nlihood of the diagnosis to 57%. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Subdural Hematoma \nTc:rtbook Presentation \nSubdural hematoma is usually seen in older patients with a history \nof falls and neurologic deterioration. The classic triad of symp-\ntoms of chronic subdural hematoma is headache, somnolence, and \nchange in mental status. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Subdural hematomas may be ac:ute (within 24 hours of \ninjury), subacute (1-14 days after injury}, or chronic. \nB. Acute and subacute subdural hematomas generally pose little \ndiagnostic: problem. They usually produce evolving, fuc:al neu-\nrologic deficits. \nC. Chronic: subdural hematomas can present with subtle symp-\ntoms, weeks to months after trauma and can pose a real diag-\nnostic: challenge. \nD. Chronic subdural hematoma is a disease seen in the elderly \nand others with cerebral atrophy. Cerebral atrophy allows \naccommodation of a slowly expanding collection of blood in \nthe subdural spac:e. \nE. Risk factors for subdural hematomas are frequent falls, alco-\nholic dependence, and use of anticoagulant medications such \nas warfarin, direc:t-ac:ting anticoagulants, or aspirin. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam \n1. The mean age at diagnosis is around 70 years in most \nstudies. \n2. The most common presenting symptoms are falls and \nprogressive neurologic deficit. \n3. Head trauma, transient neurologic deficit, seizure, and \nheadache are not uncommon modes of presentation. \n\n4. The absence of a trawna history should not be particularly \nreassuring as this history is often hard to establish. \nThe most common presenting symptom of \nchronic subdural hematoma is a history of falls. \nA high index of suspicion should be present for \nsubdural hematoma in any dderly patient with a \nhistory of falls and subacute neurologic deficits. \nB. Neuroimaging \n1. CT scan and MRI are both effective means of diagnosing \nacute subdural hematoma. \nTreatment \nChronic subdural hematomas are treated with surgical drainage \nunless they are small and asymptomatic. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Idiopathic lntracranial \nHypertension CllHJ \nTatbook Presentation \nPatients tend to be young women who are obese. Headaches caused \nby IIH are severe, occur daily, and may awaken the patient from \nsleep. These types of headaches are associated with transient visual \ndisturbances. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. IIH is frequently referred to as pseudotumor cerebri. \nB. The characteristics of IIH are well described. \n1. The disease tends to affect young (mean age around 30) \nwomen(> 90%). \n2. Sufferers are overwhelmingly obese (94%). \n3. Headache is the most common presenting symptom \nfollowed by transient vision loss and pulsatile tinnitus. \nC. Papilledema is present in the overwhelming majority \nof cases. \nD. IIH carries the risk of permanent visual loss and must be diag-\nnosed and treated. \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of IIH is based on recognition of the headache \nsyndrome, diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure, and \nexclusion of other causes of increased pressure. \nB. To make the diagnosis of IIH, other causes of intracranial \nhypertension must be excluded, usually by MRI (done prior \nto the lumbar puncture); intracranial hypertension must be \ndemonstrated on lumbar puncture (> 250 mm H 20) and \neither or both of the following must be true: \n1. The headache has developed or significantly worsened in \ntemporal relation to the development ofIIH, or led to its \ndiscovery. \n2. The headache is accompanied by pulsatile tinnitus and/or \npapilledema. \n3. The headache must improve after lwnbar puncture (with a \npostprocedure pressure of 120-170 mm H20) and resolve \nafter treatment of IIH. \nTreatment \nA. Weight loss and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which reduce \nthe rate of CSF production) are the mainstay of therapy. \nB. Loop diuretics may be used as an adjunctive therapy. \nHEADACHE I 367 \nC. Surgical procedures (CSF shunting procedures and optic nerve \nsheath fenestration) are rarely used for people with refractory \ndisease. \n\nLaboratory tests are done, and the patient is sent for a \nprecontrast head CT to look for hemorrhage and a post-\ncontrast study to Increase the sensit ivity for parenchy-\nmal lesions. The patient's test result s follow: Hb, 9.0 q/dL \n(11.7 g/dL 1 month earlier); HGT, 28.1% (36.6% 1 month \nearlier); ESR. 125 mm/h. The head CT was normal other \nthan cerebra I atrophy expected for the patient 's age. \nMrs. T was given 60 mg of prednisone daily and referred \nfor a temporal artery biopsy. This was done 3 days later \nand was diagnostic for temporal arteritis. Her headache \nImproved after 1 week of therapy. Over t he next 2 years, \nm ultlple attempts at wean Ing corticosteroids failed, and the \npatient cont inues to take 1 5 mg of prednlsone. Whlle taking \nprednisone, a spinal compression fracture, acne, diabetes \nmellltus, and difficult -to-control hypertension develop. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nThe elevated ESR made the diagnosis of temporal arteritis likely \nbut by no means certain. Taking the pretest probability of 57%, \nas it stood after the physical exam, an ESR > 100 mm/h raises the \nprobability to 72%. This is probably not high enough to accept \nthe side effects of long-term prednisone therapy without a more \ndefinitive diagnosis. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nMeningitis \nTatbook Presentation \nClassically, meningitis presents with the acute onset of the triad \nof headache, fever, and a stiff neck. Meningitis may occur in the \nsetting of a cluster of cases. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The presentation of fever and headache is common and can be \nworrisome, potentially caused by anything from influenza to \nmeningitis. The differential includes: \n1. Viral infections and almost any other febrile illness \n2. Meningitis (bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic) \n3. Encephalitis \n4. Sinusitis \nS. CNS abscess \n6. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis \nB. Although certainly not the most common cause of fever and \nheadache, meningitis is a relatively common, potentially \nlife-threatening illness. \nC. Viral causes arc 3-4 times more common than bacterial causes \nand have a generally favorable prognosis. \nD. Bacterial meningitis must be treated as a medical emergency. \nE. Community-acquired bacterial meningitis has a mortality rate \nof about 25%. Mortality rates vary by organism. \nF. Mortality rates are higher for hospital-acquired infections. \nG. The most common organisms are listed in Table 20-9. \n\n368 I CHAPTER 20 \nTable 2o-9. Common causes of meningitis in adults. \nOrganism \nViruses \nStreptococcus \npneumoniae \nNeisseria \nmeningitidis \nListeria \nmonocytogenes \nHaemophilus \ninfluenzae \nCharacteristics \nEnterovlruses (echovlrus and coxsackievirus) \nmost common \nMore common in children than adu Its \nSummer and Fall predominance \nMost common bacterial meningitis \nin adults of all ages \nMay occur de novo or by contiguous spread \n(sinuses, ears) \nMortality rates - 30% \nSecond most common cause overall \nMay occur in epidemics \nMost commonly seen ln young adults \nMortality rates - 10% \nDisease of older adults (> 60 years) and \nimmunosuppressed (including patients with \ndiabetes and alcohol abuse) \nPreviously very common cause of meningitis in \nchildren; norare because of vaccination \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. A reviestudied patients in Holland in whom community-\nacquired bacterial meningitis was diagnosed over a 3 1 /2 year \ntime period; the prevalence of various exam features follow: \nI. 95% of patients had at least 2 of the findings of headache, \nfever, stiff neck, or mencal status changes \na. 87% had a headache \nb. 83% had stiff neck \nc. 77% had temperature > 38.0C \nd. 69% had a change in mencal status \n2. 33% had focal neurologic findings \n3. 34% of those who had imaging done had an abnormal \nCT scan \nB. Patients with suppressed immune systems and the dderly are \nless likdy to have a stiff neck. \nI. Two of the most commonly used meningeal signs arc \nKernig (the inability to extend the knee with a flexed hip) \nand Brudzinski (the demonstration of flex.ion of both the \nknees and hips upon forced flexion of the neck). \n2. These signs are present in only about 60% of patients with \nmeningitis. \nC. Lumbar puncture \nI. Lumbar puncmre is the only means of making a definitive \ndiagnosis. \nTable 20-10. The GlasgoComa Scale. \n3 \n2. The CSF in acute bacterial meningitis will demonstrate WBCs \nwith neutrophil predominance, loglucose, and high protein. \nD. Patients with contraindications to lumbar puncture \n1. Frequently, the question of contraindication to lumbar \npuncture is raised. \n2. Performing a lumbar puncture in a patient with a CNS \nmass, devated intracranial pressure, or a bleeding diathesis \nplaces the patient at risk for complications such as \nherniation, paraspinal hemorrhage, and death. \n3. CNS imaging should be performed before lumbar puncture \nin any patient in whom there is a suspicion of increased \nintracranial pressure. \n4. Findings associated with mass effect on CT scan are \na. Age > 60 years \nb. Immunocompromise \nc. Prcexisting CNS disease \nd. Seizure within the previous week \ne. Abnormal level of consciousness \nf. Inability to answer 2 consecutive questions or follo\n2 consecutive commands correctly \ng. Gaze palsy, abnormal visual fields, facial palsy, arm or \nleg drift, aphasia \nPatients with an abnormal neurologic exam \nshould undergo CNS imaging prior to lumbar \npuncture. \n5. If CNS imaging is required, a patient with suspected \nmeningitis should have blood cultures drawn and then \nreceive empiric antibiotics immediatdy, undergo a CT \nscan, and then have the lumbar puncture. \nTreatment \nA. As with all infectious diseases, the specific treatment depends \non the pathogen. \nB. Because of the severity of meningeal infections, empiric therapy \nis recommended while waiting for Gram stain and culture \nresults. \nC. Antibiotic treatment should be ordered when the diagnosis \nof meningitis is suspected and given immediatdy after CSF \nbegins to be collected. \nD. In adult patients with suspected community-acquired men-\ningitis, the current recommendations are to treat empirically \nwith a third-generation ccphalosporin and vancomycin. \nE. If Listeria monocytogenes is suspected, ampicillin is also added. \nF. Corticosteroids should be added to the regimen in patients \nwith a Glasgocoma scale<!: 8.

The headaches are often \nassociated with symptoms such as irritability or anxiety. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Head trauma can cause serious cranial or neurologic injury \nincluding subdural, epidural or parenchymal hematoma, SAH, \ncerebral contusion, or depressed skull fracture. \nB. More commonly, head trauma can cause neheadaches or \nworsen preexisting headache syndromes. \nC. Trauma-related headaches might occur after minor or major \ntrauma. The IHS has distinct criteria for what qualifies as major \nand minor trauma. \nD. A headache associated with head trauma develops within 3 days \nof head injury (or becoming able to report headache after head \ntrauma) and resolves after 3 months. \nEvidence-Based. Diagnosis \nA. Acute evaluation of head trauma \n1. In a patient with head trauma or a headache seemingly \nassociated with head trauma, the first goal is to identify \nimportant and potentially treatable injury. \n2. The initial test is usually a head er scan. A difficult question \nis who can be clinically cleared without a er scan. \na. Two clinical decision rules (The Canadian Head CT Rule \nand the Nexus II). \nb. Nexus II says that if none of the following signs are \npresent, the patient does not need a head er: Evidence \nof significant skull fracture, scalp hematoma, neurologic \ndeficit, altered level of alertness, abnormal behavior, \ncoagulopathy; persistent vomiting, age> 65. \nc. The Canadian Head CT Rule is referenced at the end of \nthe chapter. \nd. Both rules have nearly 100% sensitivity for clinically \nimportant brain injuries and injuries requiring \nneurosurgical intervention. \nB. Diagnosis of headache as part of a mild traumatic brain injury \n(concussion) \n1. Headache is a common symptom of postconcussion \nsyndrome. \n2. Headache develops in about 25% of patients following \nminor trauma. \na. These headaches are most likely to be chronic. \nb. They are also most likely to meet criteria for tension-type \nheadaches. \nTreatment \nA. Any patient with concern for a concussion should undergo \ncognitive rest immediately following the injury. This may \ninvolve time away from work/school and be advised to avoid \ncomputer, television, and phone screens. \nB. Initially, NSAIDs and acetaminophen are helpful to treat \npostconcussion headache. For patients in whom chronic \nHEADACHE I 369 \nheadaches develop, amitriptyline or topiramate can be \nhelpful. \nREFERENCES \nBendtsen L, Evers S, Linde Met al.

A variety of medi-\ncations, food dyes, and metabolites can cause heme-negative red \nurine, or pigmenruria (Table 21-1). Furthermore, not all dipstick \ntests positive for blood are due to hematuria. In addition to detect-\ning heme in intact red blood cells (RBCs), urine dipsticks detect \nfree hemoglobin (commonly associated with hemolytic anemia) \nand myoglobin (commonly associated with rhabdomyolysis), \nhence leading to false-positive tests for hematuria. \nWhenever the urine dipstick is positive for \nblood, and the microscopic exam of the urine \ndoes not shoRBCs, myoglobinuria and \nhemoglobinuria should be considered. \nTrue gross (visible) hematuria is always pathologic. Microscopic \n(nonvisible) hematuria may be transient, spurious, or persistent. \nTransient causes of microscopic hematuria include urinary tract \ninfections (UTis) (which sometimes also cause gross hematuria) \nand strenuous exercise; hematuria due to these causes would be \nexpected to resolve on repeat testing after 48 hours of treatment or \nafter discontinuing exercise for 72 hours. Spurious causes include \nurinary contamination from menstruation and sexual intercourse \nin women. This chapter will focus on persistent, true hematuria. \nAll patients with hematuria should have a urine \nculture performed, regardless of the likelihood \nof infection. \nThe differential diagnosis of hemaruria is often divided into \nmicroscopic hematuria or gross hematuria. Microscopic hema-\nturia is present when microscopic inspection of at least 2 prop-\nerly collected urine specimens sho> 3 RBCs per high-powered \nfield (hpf). Gross hematuria is red or brown urine, sometimes \nwith blood clots. However, there is considerable overlap in \nthe causes of microscopic and gross hematuria, and it may be \nmore practical to first consider whether the hematuria is glom-\nerular in origin. Pivotal points that help distinguish glomerular \nhematuria from nonglomerular hematuria include dysmorphic \nRBCs (acanthocytes), red cell casts, neor acutely worsening \nhypertension or proteinuria, and increased creatinine. While these \nabnormalities may also be seen in some of the interstitial and vas-\ncular causes of hematuria, they will not be found when hematuria \nis caused by a renal structural abnormality or an abnormality distal \nto the kidneys. Visible blood clots, which are never due to a glom-\nerular cause, are another pivotal point, indicating a lower urinary \ntract source of the hematuria. \nA. Renal \n1. Glomerular \na.

He Is feeling well otherwise \nand has no other complaints. His medical history Is signifi-\ncant for chronic kidney disease (CK.D) stage 3, hyperten-\nsion treated with hydrochlorothlazide and enalapril, and a \nremote appendectomy. He has no family history of kidney \nstones, but his father did have prostate cancer diagnosed \nat age 77. Mr. A has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day \nfor 35 years.

Given this \ndifferential diagnosie, what teste should 1:1e \nordel'l'Jd1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. A does not have the pivotal urinalysis findings that suggest \na glomerular source of the hematuria. Therefore, nonglomerular \ncauses should be considered flrst. The patient's sex: (male), age \n(> 40 years), and 35 pack year smoking history are all risk factors \nfor malignancy, so bleeding from a urothelial bladder cancer needs \nto move to the top of the differential diagnosis. Although he does \nnot have abdominal or flank pain suggestive of renal colic, stone \ndisease is common and should be considered. Prostate cancer, \nBPH, and prostatitis are also common, and men with prostatitis \nmay have vague abdominal discomfon, as Mr. A does. Renal cell \ncarcinoma (RCC) is rare but must always be considered in a patient \nwith hematuria. The otherwise bland urinalysis makes interstitial \ncauses and UTI unlikely. He has no history of radiation or chemo-\ntherapy to suggest an associated cystitis. Table 21-2 lists the differ-\nential diagnosis. \n\nMr. /\\s physical exam Is normal, with no aPdomlnal masses \nor tenderness. External genitalia are normal, and digital \nrectal exam shows a symmetric, nontender prostate with-\nout nodules.

However, episodes of gross hema-\nturia may be intermittent, and thus asymptomatic nonvisible \n(microscopic) hematuria may be the only sign for some patients. If \npresent, symptoms may include dysuria or obstructive symptoms. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Accounts for 90% of urothelial cancers \nB. Visible painless hematuria, often intermittent, occurs in 85% \nof patients \nC. Risk factors for bladder cancer \nI. Male sex: and white race: bladder cancer is 3-4 times more \nlikely to develop in white males than black males or white \nfemales \n2.

Prognosis: 10-year survival for muscle-invasive cancer still \nconfined to the bladder is 65-72%. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnostic approach is based on the estimated pretest \nprobability of disease. \nB. Prevalence of cancer in patients with hematuria \n1. Microscopic hematuria \na. Up to 8.9% of patients had a malignancy in 1 series \nb. Another cohort found bladder cancer in 3.7%, RCC in \n1 %, and ureteral cancer in 0.2%. \nc. Malignancy was extremely rare in patients under the age \nof 40 with microscopic hemaruria. \n2. Gross hematuria: studies generally included older patients \nwho presented to \"hematuria clinics\" \na. Consistently > 10% had a malignancy and in some \nstudies, the prevalence was > 25% \nb. 20-25% had bladder cancer \nNo \nhematuria \nNo further \nevaluation needed \nc. 1.3-10% had prostate cancer \nd. 0.6-2% had RCC \ne. 21 % had stones \nf. 12-13% had BPH \nNephrology \nconsult \nUrothelial cancer is a must not miss diagnosis \nin patients with gross hematuria not due to an \ninfection. \nC. White light flexible cystoscopy with biopsies is the gold \nstandard for diagnosing bladder cancer; random biopsies \nof bladder tissue are taken to detect carcinoma in situ not \nvisible to the naked eye. \nD. Hc:xaminolevulinate fluorescence cystoscopy is also useful \nfor detecting carcinoma in situ. \nE. Multiphasic CT urography is done with and without contrast \nand includes imaging in the excretory phase. \n1. Has largely replaced other imaging modalities, such \nas N pyelogram, ultrasonography, conventional CT, \nand retrograde pyelography to evaluate unexplained \nhematuria \n\nTable 21-2.

May improve the sensitivity of cystoscopy if done first \n4. Delivers a relatively high radiation dose; therefore, some \nguidelines recommend avoiding in low-risk patients \nF. Ultrasound \n1. The sensitivity of ultrasound for bladder cancer is 63% and \nthe specificity 99%. \n2. Ultrasound is less sensitive than CT for detecting renal \ntumors < 3 cm. \nG. Urine cytology and biomarkers \n1. None of the many urine biomarkers investigated has \nadequate test characteristics. \n2. Urine cytology sensitivity is 7-17% for low-grade and \n53-90% for high-grade cancers; specificity is 90-98%. \nPatients aged 40 years or older, or with visible \nurinary blood clots, require cystoscopy even if \nthe bleeding is glomerular. \nHEMATURIA I 375 \nTreatment \nA. Superficial or minimally invasive bladder tumors are treated \nwith transurethral resection for both diagnostic confirmation \nand cure. \nB. lntravesicular chemotherapy (most often with Bacillus \nCalmette-Guerin [BCG]) is given immediately after the \noperation. \nC. Muscle-invasive tumors are treated with radical cystectomy \nand cisplatin-based chemotherapy. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nAlthough you are concerned about malignancy, because of \nhi5 CKD you order an ultrasound rather than a CT scan. It \nshows a 1 mm stone Jn 'the right; renal pelvls, and a 2 cm \ncyst In the left kidney. You order a PSA and refer him to \nurology for a cystoscopy. \nHave you crossed a dlagn05tlc threshold for \nthe leadfng hypothHfs, 171adder cancer? Have \nyou ruled out the active alternatives?

Epidemiology \n1. Arises from the renal epithelium and accounts for over 80% \nof renal cancers, with a 1.6: 1 male predominance and peak \nincidence between the sixth and eighth decades of life \n2. About 2% of cases are associated with inherited syndromes \nlike von Hippel-Lindau disease \n3. Risk factors \na. Smoking \nb. Obesity \nc. Hypertension \ncl. Toxic exposures \n\n376 I CHAPTER 21 \ne. Acquired cystic kidney disease associated with end-stage \nrenal disease (ESRD) \nB. Etiology \n1. The most common histologic form is dear cell, which \naccounts for 75-85% of cases. \n2. Other histologies are papillary (10-15%) and chromophobe \n(5-10%). \n3. The pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but the van \nHippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is mutated in \nmost sporadic cases of RCC. \nC. Presentation \n1. Many patients with RCC are asymptomatic until the \ndisease is advanced, with roughly 25% having distant \nmetastases or locally advanced disease at the time of \npresentation. \n2. Hematuria occurs with tumor invasion of the renal \ncollecting system, ranging from microscopic to visible \nblood dots. \n3. An abdominal or flank mass, generally only palpable \nin thin individuals, is usually firm, homogenous, and \nnontender, moving with respiration. \n4. Nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, and \nanemia, are common. \nD. Prognosis \n1. Stage I: 5-year survival > 90% \n2. Stage II: 5-year survival of75-95% \n3. Stage III who undergo nephrectomy: 5-year survival rate of \n59-70% \n4. Stage IV: median survival of 16-20 months; < 10% 5-year \nsurvival rate for patients with distant metastases \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. RCC appears as a solid renal lesion on abdominal imaging. \n1. On ultrasound, the mass does not meet criteria for a simple \ncyst. \n2. On CT. features of RCC include thickened irregular walls \nor septa and enhancement with IV contrast. \nB. RCC can remain localized, invade surrounding fascia and \nadjacent organs, and/or metastasize. \n1. CT scan is used for staging. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nMr. S is a 24-year-old white man who comes to your office \nafter being told there was 'some blood detected' on a \nscreening urinalysis obtained 2 weeks ago during an Army \nenlistment physlcal. He has not seen any blood In his urine, \nIs anxious to 5tart ba51c training, and \"doe5n't under5tand \nwhat all the fuss is about.\" He denies any dysuria, abdom-\ninal pain, fevers, or urethral discharge. Exam is notable for \na flt, well-developed young man in no acute distress. His \nvita! slgn5 were temperature, 37.2C; pulse, 68 bpm; BP. \n126178 mm Hg; RR, 16 breaths per minute. His exam Is \na. 78% sensitive and 96% specific for the detection of \nrenal vein invasion \nb. 83% sensitive and 88% specific for the detection of \nmetastatic adenopathy \nc. 46% sensitive and 98% specific for the detection of \nperinephric invasion \nd. 100% specific for detecting adjacent organ invasion \n2. Bone scan, CT chest, MRI, or PET scanning are used to \ndetect distant metastases. \nTreatment \nA. For patients with isolated, solid renal masses, resection with \neither partial or complete nephrectomy is preferred to biopsy \nsince it is both diagnostic and therapeutic; consultation with \nurology is essential to determine whether surgery or surveil-\nlance is indicated. \nB. Deciding whether to perform a partial or complete (radical) \nnephrectomy depends on \n1. Stage and location of the tumor \n2. Baseline kidney function \n3. Functional status \n4, Presence of other comorbidities \nC. A reasonable alternative for individuals at high risk \nfor complications from surgery is thermal ablation \n(eg, cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation). \nD. Consultation with oncology is indicated for patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic RCC. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. Ms cystoscopy detects a small papillary tumor local-\nlzed to the uroeplthellum of his bladder. Hexamlnolevullna.te \nfluorescence cystoscopy does not detect any carcinomas \nIn situ. CT ur~raphy does not demonstrate any masses \nelsewhere in t he upper urinary tract or kidneys. His bladder \ncancer Is classified as superflclal and he Is treated with \ntransurethral resection followed by BCG therapy. At a \nfollow-up vlstt 1 year later he Is cancerfree and feeling well. \ncompletely normal with a notable absence of abdominal \npain, costovertebral angle tenderness, urethral discharge \nor te5tlcular pa In, and lower extrem lty edema. \nHi5 screening and in-office urinalyses both sho\n2+ protein. 2+ blood. and 5-10 RBCs/hpf. The dipstick \n15 otherwise negative, and there are no WBCs or bacteria. \nMlcro5coplc analysis of the urine In the office al5o reveal5 \noccasional dysmorphlc RBCs but no RBC casts. \n~ \nAt this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \n1~r what are the active alternatives, and is \nthens a must not miss diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential dfag nosis, what tests should j,e \nordered? \n\nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. S is asymptomatic with nonvisible (or microscopic) hema-\nturia. Based on the 2 separate urinalyses, it is persistent. In patients \nyounger than 40 without risk factors, cancer is an uncommon cause \nof asymptomatic nonvisible hematuria; in the absence of lower \nurinary symptoms, a urologic cause is rare. Notably, the concom-\nitant proteinuria and the dysmorphic RBCs are pivotal points for \na glomerular source. The most common glomerular causes are lgA \nnephropathy and TBMN. Table 21-3 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nThe patient reports no prior medical or surgical history; \nhe has not seen a physician since his last pedlatrician \nvlslt at age 18. No one In his family has any known history \nof hematurla or kidney problems. He has been In a stable, \nmon00amous relationship with his girlfriend for over a year \nand is not taking any medications or supplements. On more \ndetailed questioning. he does recall \"3 or 4\" previous epi-\nsodes of his urine changing color for a fedays. which he \nassociated with colds or minor respiratory Infections. Basic \nmetabolic profile Is normal. with a creatinlne of 0.9 mg/dL \nand BUN of 12 mg/dL. \n~ \nIs the c:llnlc:al Information &Uffic:lent to make a \n~r diagnosis?

(typically an upper \nrespiratory) infection. It can also be discovered upon detection of \nasymptomatic, nonvisible hematuria with or without proteinuria \nduring routine medical screening. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. The most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis \nworldwide. \nI. Peak incidence oflgAN is between the second and fourth \ndecades of life, though it can present at any age. \n2. Occurs with greatest frequency in Asians and whites. \nB. An important cause of progressive CKD, with ESRD develop-\ning in up to 50% of patients within 25 years of diagnosis. \nC. Etiology of IgAN \nI. Caused by glomerular deposition of Al isotype oflgA in \nthe mesangium. \n2. No evidence of a role for any specific antigen despite the \nrelation between mucosa! infections and episodes of visible \nhemaruria. \n3. Most cases of IgAN are sporadic, although familial cases \ndo occur and appear to be transmitted as an autosomal \ndominant trait with incomplete penetrance. \nD. Clinical manifestations of lgAN \nI. One or more episodes of visible hematuria, usually \nassociated with upper respiratory infection (often called \nl)'ttpharyngitic hematuria) and sometimes accompanied \nby flank pain and low-grade fever (present in 40-50% of \npatients). \n2. Nonvisible hematuria and typically mild proteinuria, \ndetected incidentally on routine screening (present in \n30--40% of patients). \n3. Advanced, progressive CKD, hypertension, and heavy \nproteinuria, in addition to hematuria (seen in small \nproportion of patients); nephrotic range proteinuria \n(present in ~5% of patients) \n4. lgAN rarely occurs secondary to other conditions \nlike cirrhosis, celiac disease, and HN infection, all \nof which are associated with a high frequency of lgA \ndeposition. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Urine dipstick with microscopy and culture should be used \nto rule out infection, confirm the findings of hematuria, and \nevaluate for proteinuria. \nB. A definitive diagnosis can only be made by renal biopsy with \nimmunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase studies for lgA \ndeposits. \nI. In the absence of proteinuria, hypertension, or decreased \nglomerular filtration rate (GFR), the clinical course (at least \nshort-term) of patients with lgAN is generally benign and \nkidney biopsy is usually not indicated; periodic monitoring \nis recommended in these cases. \n2. Proteinuria (> 500-1000 mg/day), elevated serum \ncreatinine, or hypertension suggests more severe or \nprogressive disease and are indications for kidney biopsy to \nestablish the diagnosis. \n\n378 I CHAPTER 21 \nC. The pathognomonic: biopsy finding of IgAN is prominent, \nglobular deposits oflgA in the mesangium on immunofluores-\nccncc microscopy. \nTreatment \nA. Patients with isolated hematuria, normal GFR, and \nno significant proteinuria should be monitored every \n6-12 months for signs of progression (worsening \nproteinuria, BP, and GFR). \nB. Clinical predictors of progression oflgAN, including \nproteinuria > 500-1000 mg/day, decreased GFR, and \nhypenension often signal the need for treatment. \nC. Treatment is primarily aimed at reducing proteinuria and \noptimizing BP to minimize risk of progression. \nD. Treatment of progressive IgAN \n1. Angiotensin-convening enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or \nangiotensin-reccptor blocker (ARB) therapy slowi; progression \nby optimizing BP control and reducing proteinuria. \n2. Fish oil has also been used in IgAN patients with \n> 1000 mg/day of proteinuria despite 3-6 months of \nACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, although a benefit has \nnot been clearly established. \n3. Some patients with IgAN with signs of more \nsevere inflammatory disease on biopsy may require \nimmunosuppressive therapy. \n4. Kidney transplantation is an option for patients with \nIgAN who have had progression to ESRD, but recurrence \nis common. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nA spot urine total protein to creatlnlne ratio, to quantify the \namount of protein in the urine, is found to be 11 00 mg.I day. \nHe noremembers that he did have a sore throat prior to \nthe first urine sample. \n~ \nHaV1s you croe&ed a diagno&tic thnsehold for \n1~JI\"' the leading hyPOtheele, lgA nephropathy1 \nHave you ruled out the active alternatlvee7 \nDo other tests nl!ll!ld to be done to exclude the \naltemative dlagnoeee1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Thin Basement \nMembrane Nephropathy \nTextbook Presentation \nMost individuals with TBMN have isolated hematuria with nor-\nmal kidney function, no or minimal proteinuria, and a uniformly \nthinned glomerular basement membrane (GBM) on electron \nmicroscopy analysis of biopsy specimen. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The most common cause of persistent hemaruria in children \nand adults \n1. Occurs in at least 1 % of the general population and is often \nfamilial \n2. A family history ofhematuria is present in 30-50% of \nTBMN cases. \nB. Characteristically presents with persistent or intermittent \nhematuria incidentally discovered on routine urinalysis \n1. Most patients have isolated hemaruria, which can present at \nvirtually any age, without proteinuria or kidney impairment. \n2. Dysmorphic RBCs are commonly seen, and RBC casts may \noccur. \n3. Episodes of visible hemaruria may occur in a small percentage \nofindividuals with TBMN (12%) but are far more common \nin Alpon syndrome (33%) and IgA nephropathy (88%). \n4. Proteinuria is rarely seen in children with TBMN, but mild \nproteinuria (up to 1 g/day) may be seen in a minority of \nadult patients. \nC. TBMN is caused by defects in type N collagen genes, which leads \nto a diffuse thinning of the GBM seen on electron microscopy. \nD. The long-term prognosis in most patients with true TBMN is \nexcellent. \nEvidence-Based Diagnos.U \nA. The only way to definitively diagnose TBMN is by kidney \nbiopsy and electron microscopy. \n1. Kidney biopsy is usually not performed in patients with \nisolated hematuria, normal kidney function, and no or \nminimal proteinuria. The diagnosis is often inferred in \nthese patients with positive f.unily history of hematuria and \nnegative family history of CKD. \n2. Kidney biopsy is more commonly performed in patients \nwith suspected TBMN who also have proteinuria \n(> 200-300 mg/day). \nB. Biopsy reveals diffuse, uniform thinning of the GBM on \nelectron microscopy, and the absence of other significant \nglomerular pathology. \nC. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the type N collagen \nalpha-3 to alpha-5 chains is useful in helping distinguish \nbetween TBMN and early Alpon syndrome (with microscopic \nhematuria and thin GBM), as these chains are usually absent \nor abnormally distributed in Alport syndrome. \nTreatment \nA. Progressive CKD with TBMN is rare, but regular follow-up \nand monitoring is important. \nB. While there are no proven therapies for TBMN, a goal BP of \n< 130/80 mm Hg and angiotensin inhibition is recommended \nfor patients with TBMN and proteinuria > 1 g/day. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Infection-Related \nGlomerulonephritis \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation of infection-related glomerulonephritis \n(IRGN) is neonset of hematuria, proteinuria, and edema, often \nwith hypertension and mild acute kidney injury, following or con-\ncurrent with an infection. \nD.Uease Highlights \nA. Epidemiology \n1. In the developing world, IRGN (especially poststreptococcal \nglomerulonephritis [GN]) occurs primarily in children (ages \n6-10) and young adults, with a male predominance (2-3:1). \n2. In the developed world, IRGN affects mostly adults, \nespecially those with immunocompromising comorbidities \nsuch as diabetes mellitus and alcoholism. \n\nB. Etiology \n1. Upper respiratory and skin infections are the 2 most \ncommon sites of infection leading to IRGN, although \nmultiple other sites have also been implicated. \n2. Historically, most cases have been attributed to group A \nstreptococci, specifically Streptococcus pyogenes. \n3. More recently, it has become clear that other strains of \nstreptococci (groups C and G), staphylococci, gram-negative \nbacilli, mycobacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses can also \ncause IRGN. \n4. One-third to one-half of cases of IRGN in developed countries \nare associated with infections of gram-negative bacilli. \nC. Clinical manifestations \n1. Acute nephritic syndrome (poststreptococcal GN is the \nprototypical form) \na. Presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and edema, often \naccompanied by hypertension and mild acute kidney \ninjury \nb. Urinary output usually improves after 5-7 days, followed \nrapidly by resolution of edema and normalization of BP \n2. Rapidly progressive nephritic syndrome \na. Rarely, acute postinfectious GN (usually poststreptococcal) \nis complicated by rapidly worsening GFR \nb. Crescent formation is often present on biopsy but tends \nto be limited. \n3. Subclinical or asymptomatic GN \na. Present in many patients with mild, self-limited \nstreptococcal infections \nb. Characterized by low-grade proteinuria (< 1 g/day), \npyuria, and nonvisible (microscopic) hematuria; often \ngoes undetected \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. In children, nephritis typically follows pharyngitis by \n1-2 weeks and skin infection by 2-4 weeks. \n1. During this time, asymptomatic nonvisible (microscopic) \nhematuria and proteinuria is often present. \n2. Upon symptomatic presentation (eyelid and diffuse edema, \nsmoky colored urine), a urinalysis shows proteinuria (mild \nto nephrotic range), pyuria (97%), and often hematuria \n(30-37%) with RBC casts. \n3. Acute kidney injury and hypertension are also common \n(60-80%). \n4. Hypocomplementemia is present in 90% of children with \npoststreptococcal GN and 35--80% of adults with IRGN. \na. C3 is typically lowhile C4 is normal. \nb. One-third of patients with IRGN will have both lo\nC3 and loC4. \n5. Serologies for recent streptococcal infection (ASO, \nDNase B, streptokinase, hyaluronidase, anti-NAD) are \noften positive, even when patients do not report recent \nrespiratory or skin infection. \na. The streptozyme test measures all 5 of these \nstreptococcal antibodies and performs better than any \nindividual antibody measurement alone. \nb. It has a sensitivity of95% in patients with recent group \nA streptococcal pharyngitis and 80% in those with \nstreptococcal skin infections. \n6. Biopsy is usually not recommended in children. \nHEMATURIA I 379 \nB. In a significant proportion (45%) of adults, the precipitating \ninfection is still present and only discovered at the time IRGN \nis diagnosed. \n1. Adults present with gross hematuria and diffuse edema; \nproteinuria can lead to foamy urine and hypertension can \ncause headaches. \n2. Exam may reveal signs of infection, such as pharyngitis, \npneumonia, cellulitis/abscess, endocarditis, or urethral/ \nvaginal discharge. \n3. Older adults (25%) may have additional signs of volume \noverload (increased jugular venous pressure, s3 gallop, \npulmonary crackles, lower extremity edema) stemming \nfrom acute volume overload precipitated by the acute \nkidney injury. \n4. Urinalysis shows at least nonvisible (microscopic) hematuria, \nalthough gross hematuria is often already present. \n5. Proteinuria (mild to nephrotic range) is usually present, \nand RBC casts may be seen on microscopy. \n6. Biopsy is usually recommended in adults to confirm \ndiagnosis and rule out glomerulonephritides that require \nimmediate immunosuppressive therapy. \nTreatment \nA. Children should be treated with supportive therapy. \nB. Adults \n1. Treat underlying infection, which is often ongoing at the \ntime of diagnosis. \n2. Manage complications of nephritis. \na. Antihypertensives, specifically ACE inhibitor if \nmoderate to heavy proteinuria \nb. Diuretics and sodium restriction \n3. Immunosuppressive therapy is not recommended. \nC. Prognosis \n1. Complete recovery occurs in almost all children, although \npotentially with increased likdihood of CKD and \nhypertension later in life. \n2. Adults with IRGN have a poorer prognosis. \na. Up to 50% have persistent kidney dysfunction, and up \nto 33% progress to ESRD. \nb. Elderly and diabetic patients have the highest risk of \npersistent CKD and ESRD. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nIn the absence of any family history of hematurla or CKD, lgA \nnephropathy Is t he most likely diagnosis.

Initial laboratory evaluation reveals \na nonnal T5H, normal elt:etro(yte5. and a calcium level of \n10.8 mg/GIL (nl 8.4-10.2). \n::.,.-' What le the dlffisnsntlal dlagnoele of \n1~JI\"\" hypercalcemla1 Howould you frame the \ndlffisnsntlal1 \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nHypercalcemia is generally detected in 1 of 3 clinical circum-\nstances: asymptomatic patients without risk factors for hypercalcc-\nmia; during evaluation of symptoms or findings that can be related \nto hypcrcalcemia, such as constipation, weakness, fatigue, depres-\nsion, nephrolithiasis, or osteopenia; and in patients presenting with \nsevere hypercalcemia and resulting altered mental status. \nAlthough most cases of hypercalcemia are due to only a hand-\nful of conditions (primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of \nmalignancy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the milk-alkali \nsyndrome), the complete differential diagnosis is extensive. The \nmost commonly used framework for the differential is organized \nby pathophysiology. What follows is a somewhat abbreviated list \norganized by etiology. \nA. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related \nl . Primary hyperparathyroidism \n2. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (with calcium \nsupplementation) \n3. Tertiary hypcrparathyroidism \n4. Lithium therapy (causes hypercalcemia in about 10% \nof patients) \n5. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) \nB. Hypercalcemia of malignancy \nl. Secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) \na. Squamous cell carcinomas \nb. Adenocarcinoma of lung. pancreas, kidney, and others \n2. Osceolytic metastasis \na. Breast cancer \nb. Plasma cell myeloma (formerly multiple myeloma) \n3. Production of calcitriol (Hodgkin disease) \nC. Vitamin D-rdated \nl. Hypervitaminosis D \n2. Granulomatous diseases \nD. Other relatively common causes of hypercalcemia \n1. Milk-alkali syndrome \n2. Hyperthyroidism \n3. Thiazidc diuretics \n4. Falsely elevated serum calcium (secondary to increased \nserum binding protein) \na. Hypcralbumincmia \nb. Hypergammaglobulincmia \nClinically, the differential diagnosis is most commonly orga-\nnized by the pivotal findings of whether or not the PTH is elevated \nand whether the patient has a known malignancy. A useful clinical \nalgorithm is presented in Figure 22-1 . \nBefore returning to the case, it is worthwhile to briefly \nreviethe basics of calcium metabolism. Calcium levels arc \ndictated by the actions of PTH, calcitonin, and calcitriol \n(1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). PTH levels rise and fall in response to \nscrum calcium levels. High levels of PTH stimulate a rise in serum \ncalcium by increasing both renal tubular calcium rcabsorption and \nbone resorption. PTH also stimulates the conversion of calcidiol \n(25-hydroxyvitarnin D) to calcitriol in the kidneys. Calcitriol lcads \nto a further increase in serum calcium via increased absorption \nof calcium in the small intestine. Phosphate metabolism is also \ncontrolled by PTH and calcitriol; PTH generally lowers phosphate \nlevels through its effects on the kidney, while calcitriol generally \nraises phosphate levels through its effects on the intestine and \ninhibitory effects on PTH levds. Calcitonin lowers calcium by \nsuppressing calcium rdease from bones by inhibiting the function \nof osteoclasts. \n\nMrs. D comes to your office for an Initial visit.

This disease is \noften asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. The chronicity of \nthis patient's hypercalcemia, as well as her relatively good health, \nare pivotal points that make this diagnosis even more likdy. \nHypercalcemia related to thiazide use is also possible. Although \nthiazide diuretic-related hypercalcemia is usually caused by under~ \nprimary hyperparathyroidism, thiazides do occasionally cause mild \nhypercalcemia in patients with no other cause. FHH is another \ncause of chronic, usually asymptomatic, hypercalcemia. Although \nit is usually diagnosed early in life, it can present similarly to \nprimary hyperparathyroidism. Most patients with hypercalcemia \ndue to a malignancy have a known malignancy when presenting \nwith hypercalccmia. Sarcoidosis is not a common cause of hyper~ \ncalcemia but should could be considered if another diagnosis is not \nmade.

Occasionally, it is \ndetected during the evaluation of nonspecific symptoms, such as \nfatigue or constipation. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Primary hyperparathyroidism most commonly presents with \na modestly elevated calcium and fe(if any) symptoms rather \nthan the classic presentation of \"stones, bones, groans, and \npsychiatric overtones.\" \nPrimary hyperparathyroidism accounts for \nmore than 90% of cases of hypercalccmia in \notherwise healthy ambulatory patients. \nB. Etiology of primary hyperparathyroidism \n1. 85% of the cases of primary hyperparathyroidism are due \nto solitary parathyroid adenomas. \n2. Parathyroid hyperplasia, multiple adenomas, and the rare \ncarcinoma cause the other 15% of cases. \nHYPERCALCEMIA I 383 \na. Parathyroid hyperplasia can be sporadic or inherited. \nb. Inherited syndromes of parathyroid hyperplasia include, \namong others, the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) \ntype I and IIA syndromes. Patients with other relevant \ndiagnoses such as pituitary tumors, islet cell tumors, \nmedullary thyroid carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas \nshould be evaluated for these syndromes. \nC. Clinical manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism \n1. Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and \nweakness are more common among patients with primary \nhyperparathyroidism. \n2. Decreased bone density is common in patlenrs with \nprimary hyperparathyroidism while classic osteitis fibrosis \ncystica is exceedingly rare today. \n3. Nephrolithiasis is present in 15-20% of patients with primary \nhyperparathyroidism. \n4. Other symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism probably \ninclude increased frequency of hypertension, gout, and \ncalcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Hypercalcemia should be confirmed before evaluating a \npatient for primary hyperparathyroidism. \n1. The calcium level should be remeasured and corrected \nto account for the plasma protein binding of calcium. \nThe corrected calcium= Total calcium (mg/dL) + \n0.8(4-albumin [g/dL]). \n2. An ionized calcium level can also be measured. \nB. Other effects of elevated PTH levels (hypercalciuria, \nhypophosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia) are seldom useful \nin differentiating primary hyperparathyroidism from \nhypercalcemia of malignancy-the second most common \ncause of hypercalcemia. \nC. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is usually \nstraightforward. \n1. The diagnosis is extremely likely in an otherwise healthy \npatient with chronic hypercalcemia. \n2. An elevated PTH level is confirmatory, distinguishing \nprimary hyperparathyroidism from hypercalcemia of \nmalignancy which has loserum PTH levels. \n3. 10--20% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism \nhave normal PTH levels (a fmding that is, in fact, \ninappropriate given the hypercalcemia). In these patients, \nFHH must be excluded. (See the discussion of \nFHH below.) \n4, Of less importance to the discussion here, primary \nhyperparathyroidism can present with a normal \ncalcium level. \na. This is often detected when a PTH level is sent in \na patient with abnormal parathyroid imaging or \nosteoporosis. \nb. The finding likely represents the earliest stage of \nprimary hyperparathyroidism. \nc. Before making the diagnosis of primary hyperparathy-\nroidism with a normal calcium level, other causes of \nelevated PTH with normal calcium should be excluded. \n(1) Vitamin D deficiency \n(2) CKD \n(3) Certain drugs (thiazides, bisphosphonates, \ndenosumab, lithium) \n\n384 I CHAPTER 22 \nTreatment \nA. Definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism is \nsurgical parathyroidectomy. \nB. Who needs surgery? \n1. Because of the generally benign course of primary \nhyperparathyroidism, not everyone needs surgery. \n2. Recommendations &om consensus panels are based on \nwho is most likely to progress to symptomatic disease and \nwho would benefit most from surgery. \n3. Indications for surgery \na. Symptoms of hypercalcemia \nb. Serum calcium > 1 mg/ dL above normal \nc. Creatinine clearance< 60 mL/min \nd. Nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, or hypercalciuria \ne. Osteoporosis (bone density with T score < 2.5 at any \nsite} or &agility fracture \nf. Age < 50 years \ng. Patient preference or patient inability to comply with \nlong-term monitoring \nC. This approach to deciding which patients undergo surgery \nappears to be effective. A study observing 52 asymptomatic \npeople for up to 10 years demonstrated the disease is usually \nnot progressive. \n1. 38 (73%) had no progression of disease \n2. Patients who required surgery did so for the following \nreasons: \na. Hypercalcemia worsened in 2 patients \nb. Hypercalciuria developed in 8 patients \nc. Lobone density developed in 6 patients \nD. Parathyroidectomy \n1. Parathyroidectomy is markedly effective at inducing \nnormocalcemia (95-98%), improving bone density \n(100%}, and improving symptoms (82%). \n2. Preoperative imaging is recommended. \n3. Patients undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy \nshould have intraoperative PTH monitoring. \nE. Monitoring (for patients not undergoing surgery) \n1. Assessment of symptoms, calcium level, and kidney \nfunction yearly \n2. Biyearly bone density screening of the hip, spine, \nand wrist \n3. Imaging to detect nephrolithiasis if clinically suspected \n4, Vitamin D deficiency should be treated and patients \nshould be encouraged to meet guidelines for calcium intake \n(1000-1200 mg/day}. \nF. If surgery is indicated but the patient declines or is unfit for \nsurgery, medical therapy is indicated. \n1. Patients should be encouraged to remain active, stay well \nhydrated, and maintain moderate calcium and vitamin D \nintake in order to retain bone health and reduce the risk of \nkidney stones. \n2. Thiazide diuretics and lithium carbonate, both of which \ncan exacerbate hypercalcemia, should be avoided. \n3. Bisphosphonates are often used to maintain bone density. \n4, Cinacalcet, a calcium mimetic, most commonly used to \ntreat secondary hyperparathyroidism, is also indicated in \nfor these patients. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nFinal laboratory test results for Mrs. D follow: \nCalcium: 10.9 mg/dL \nIonized calcium: 6 .20 mg/dL (nl 4.60-5.40) \nInorganic phosphate: 3.3 mg/dL (nl 2 .5-4.4) \n25-Hydroxy Vitamin D: 56 ng/ml (nl 20-50) \nPTH: 166 pg/ml (nl < 60 pg/mL) \nA diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroldlsm was made. \nHave you croesed a diagnostic threshold \nfor the leading hYJ\"\"thHl9, primary \nhyperparathyroldlsm7 Have you ruled out the \nactive alttJrnatlvH7 Do other tnte need to \nbe done to exclude the alternative diagn0981!17 \nOther than primary hyperparathyroidism, the differential diagnosis \nofhypercalcemia in a patient with an devated PTH includes thiaz-\nide and lithium use, secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, and \nFHH. Given the patient's medications, normal kidney function, \nage at presentation, and lack of a family history of hypercalcemia, \nprimary hyperparathyroidism is clearly the most likely diagnosis. \nThiazide diuretic use can be associated with hypercalcemia and \nmay have been a contributing factor in the initial presentation. \nFHH would remain a possibility if not for the markedly elevated \nPTH level. \nAlternative Diagnosis: FHH \nTc:rtbook Presentation \nThe diagnosis of FHH is usually made in childhood during the \nevaluation of asymptomatic hypercalcemia or during screening \ncalled for because of a positive family history. The condition may \nalso present during adulthood as hypercalcemia with a normal to \nslightly elevated PTH. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The mutation in FHH makes the calcium-sensing receptor, \nfound on various tissues throughout the body, less sensitive \nto calcium. In the parathyroid glands, this means that higher \nserum calcium levels are needed to suppress PTH release. The \ndefect leads to: \n1. Secretion of PTH inappropriate to calcium levels \n2. Renal absorption of calcium inappropriate to calcium levels \nB. Most patients with FHH are asymptomatic at the time of \npresentation. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. FHH is usually easily distinguished from primary hyperpara-\nthyroidism as the former usually has mildly elevated calcium \nlevels and a normal PTH level while the latter has an elevated \nPTH level. \nB. Differentiation can be difficult because patients with FHH \nsometimes have a mildly elevated PTH, and patients with \nprimary hyperparathyroidism often have mild hypercalcemia \nand have a normal PTH 10-20% of the time. \nC. Two important distinguishing feamres are: \n1. Patients with FHH usually have family members with \nFHH. The genetic defect is inherited in an autosomal \ndominant manner. \n\n2. Urinary calcium ex1:retion is redu1:ed in FHH (> 99% \nreabsorption vs < 99% in primary hyperparathyroidism). \nD. Diagnostic Testing \n1. Patients with FHH will have hyper1:al1:emia and a normal \nor slightly elevated PTH. \n2. In the setting of a normal vitamin D level and normal \ncalcium intake, urinary 1:alcium < 100 mg/day and \nfra1:tional excretion of calcium< 0.01 (fra1:tional ex1:retion \nof 1:alcium =(urine calcium x serum 1:reatinine)/(serum \ncalcium x urine creatinine) suggests FHH. \n3. Serum magnesium is often increased in FHH. \n4. Genetic testing is available when the diagnosis is diflkult \nto make. \nTreatment \nTreaunent for FHH is not necessary because the hyper1:alc:emia is \nmild and only very rarely leads to complications. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Thiazide-lnduced \nHypercalcemia \nTatbook Presentation \nThiazide diuretics cause mild hypercakemia. This hypercal1:emia is \nassociated with a normal or elevated PTH 98% of the time. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Thiazide diuretics cause hypocalciuria. \n1. Sodium depletion causes increased sodium and calcium \nretention in the proximal tubule. \n2. Thiazides probably also augment the renal effe<:t ofpTH. \nB. Thiazide-induced hypercalcemia has traditionally thought \nto be mild and short-lived because in response to the \nhypocalciuria-induced hypercalcemia, PTH secretion is \nsuppressed, normalizing calcium levels. \nC. A re1:ent study, however, suggests that hyper1:alc:emia is diswv-\nered, on average, about 5 years after initiation of therapy. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \n\nMrs. W is an 80-year-old woman who is admitted to the \nhospttal because of lethargy, abdominal pain, and hyper \ncalcemla. She reports 1 year of epigastrlc pain that was \nlnltially mlld but has become severe and persistent over \nthe last 6 weeks. Her daughter, who found her somewhat \nconfused at their weekly lunch, brought her to the office. \nOn evaluation, she is found to be lethargic but oriented to \nperson and place. Vltal signs: temperature, 36.9\" C; pulse, \n94 bpm; BP. 110/90 mm Hg; RR. 14 breaths per minute. \nShe Is orthostatlc. Her exam Is remarkable for cachexla and \nhepatomegaly. \nInitial laboratory test results In the physician's office were: \nSodium: 134 mEq!L \nPotassium: 3.9 mEq/L \nHYPERCALCEMIA I 385 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of thiazide-induced hypercalccmia depends \non documenting hypercalcemia in a patient taking a thiazide \ndiuretic. \nB. Upon diswntinuation of thiazide, approximately one-third of \npatients will have resolution of hypercalccmia. \nC. Of the remaining two-thirds, about 80% will be found to have \nprimary hyperparathyroidism. \nTreatment \nA patient with transient hypercal1:emia after beginning a thiazide \ndoes not need treatment. Those with persistent hypercalcemia \nafter diswntinuing therapy should be evaluated for primary \nhyperparathyroidism. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nThe comb I nation of hypercalcem!a and an elevated PTH con-\nfirms the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroldism. Based \non the patient's severe constipat ion, without another \ncause, the decision was made to treat her hyperparathy-\nroidism. On ultrasound, a 3 x 3 cm parathyroid adenoma \nwas Ident ified. A minimally invasive parathyroidectomy \nwas performed. successfully removing a 4-g adenoma. \nAfter close monitoring of her calcium levels postoperatively \n(when hypocalcemla can occur). the patient had rapid nor-\nmalization of her calcium levels. Her constipation, however. \npersisted. In the end, the constipation was considered to \nbe functiona I and unrelated to the hypercalcemia. \nAs disc:ussed above, patient symptoms are an indication for sur-\ngery.

There are multiple pivotal points in this case that \nsuggest a diagnosis other than the most common cause of hyper-\ncalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism. These include the degree \nof hypercalcemia and the abnormalities found on physical exam \nand laboratory studies. The patient's age and hepatomegaly sug-\ngest hypercalcemia of malignancy. Most patients with hypercal-\ncemia of malignancy have a previously diagnosed cancer, but it \nis possible for symptoms of cancer and hypercal1:emia to present \nsimultaneously or for symptoms of hypercalcemia to be the pre-\nsenting symptoms of the malignancy. Malignancy usually leads \nto hypercalcemia through the elaboration of PTHrP or through \nosseous metastasis. \nThe milk-alkali syndrome should be considered. The mod-\nern version of this syndrome is usually 1:aused by ingestion of \n1:alcium 1:arbonate in an effort to treat or prevent dyspepsia or \nosteoporosis or as a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroid-\nism. This syndrome classically presents with hypercal1:emia, \nmetabolic alkalosis, and acute kidney injury. The presence of \nonly 1 of the syndrome's 3 features (hypercalcemia} makes the \ndiagnosis less likely. The presen1:e of other illnesses or medication \nuse may suggest less common causes of hypercalcemia, such as \ngranulomatous disease.

If not, what other Information do \nyounsed? \nLeading Hypothesis: Humoral Hypercalcemia \nof Malignancy \nTextbook Presentation \nHypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly dete1:ted in \npatients with previously diagnosed can1:ers. It is un1:ommon for \nsymptomatic hypercalcemia to be the presenting symptom of a \nmalignancy. Hypercalcemia of malignancy carries a horrendous \nprognosis with a 50% 30-day mortality. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a heterogeneous process. \n1. The most common pathophysiology behind hypercalcemia of \nmalignancy is the elaboration of PTHrP by tumor l:dls. This is \nreferred to as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). \n2. Tumors metastatic to bone may also c:ause hypercalcemia \nthrough lo1:al osteolytk effe1:ts on the bones, sometimes \nvia local daboration of PTHrP. This syndrome is discussed \nbdow. \n3. It is likdy there is a great deal of overlap between these first \n2 causes. \n4. Rarely, tumors can c:ause hypercalcemia by elaborating \nvitamin D (seen most commonly with lymphoma). \nB. The malignancies that commonly cause hypercalcemia are \n(in approximate order of frequency): \n1. Lung \n2. Breast \n3. Plasma cell myeloma \n4. Lymphoma \n5. Head and neck \n6. Renal \n7. Prostate \nC. PTHrP is a normal, physiologic:, protein that is produced by \nmany nonneoplastk tissues. \n1. The protein shares considerable sequence homology to \nPTH and binds to the same receptor. \n2. PTH and PTHrP affect the bones and kidneys in the \nsame way. \n3. Certain malignancies elaborate the protein in relatively \nlarge amounts. \na. PTHrP is detectable in 80% of patients with \nhyper1:alcemia and malignancy. \n\nb. The most common tumors that produce PTHrP arc \nsquamocell carcinomas and adcnocarcinomas of the \nlung, pancreas, and kidney. \n4. In hypercalcemia of malignancy secondary to PTHrP, \nhypercalcemia commonly precedes bony metastasis. \nEvidence--Based Diagnos.is \nA. Similar to primary hyperparathytoidism, hypcrcalccmia of \nmalignancy sddom presents significant diagnostic confusion. \nB. In patients with a known malignancy, the diagnosis is made by \ndetecting high PTHrP and loPTH levels. \nTreatment \nA. The ultimate ueatment for hypercalccmia of malignancy is the \ntreatment of the underlying disease. \nB. Beyond treatment of the malignancy, treatment aimed directly \nat hypercalcemia depends on its severity. \nC. The mainstays of treatment for moderate and severe devations \nof calcium are the bisphosphonates. \n1. Bisphosphonatcs work by inhibiting ostcoclast activity. \n2. Pamidronate and zoledronic acid are both approved for \nthe treatment ofhypercalcemia of malignancy in the \nUnited States. \nD. For patients with severe, sytnptomatic hypcrcalcemia, therapy \nmust be more rapidly effective than treatment of the under-\nlying disease or bisphosphonatc therapy (which takes about \n48 hours to reach full effectiveness). \n1. Saline hydration treats the hypovolemia that frequently \naccompanies hypercalcemia and decreases reabsorption \nof calcium in the proximal tubule of hypovolemic, \nhypercalcemic patients. \n2. Once hydration is attained, a loop diuretic can further \nassist in achieving calciurcsis. \n3. Calcitonin \na. Calcitonin rapidly decreases calcium levds by increasing \nrenal calcium excretion and decreasing bone resorption. \nb. Calcitonin's effect is short-lived as tachyphylaxis \ndevelops after about 48 hours. \nE. ln all patients being treated for hypercalcemia of malignancy, \ncare should be taken to institute other measures known to \ndecrease scrum calcium. Calcium supplements should be \nstopped, drugs that lead to hypercalccmia (lithium, thiazides) \nshould be hdd, hypophosphatemia should be treated and \nweight-bearing exercise should be encouraged. \nGiven the results of the patient's ultrasound, it is highly likely that \nshe has a malignancy that is causing the hypercalccmia. The next \nstep is to make a dd1nitive diagnosis of the malignancy so that \nspecific treatment can be instituted. Determining hothe malig-\nnancy is cawing hypercalccmia will be part of this evaluation; is the \nhypercalccmia a result of osseous metastasis or of PTHrP? \n\nThe patient was given nonnal saline for hydration ant.I furo-\nsemlde for diuresis once she was thought to be fluid replete. \nHer calcium dropped over the first 3 days In the hoep!tal to \n11.2 mg/dl, where ft remained stable. \nAs a follow-up to the ultraeountJ. a chest/abdomen/ \npeMs CT was ordered. This revealed a large lung mass and \nHYPERCALCEMIA I 387 \nmultiple liver masses. CT-gulded biopsy of the liver was con-\nsistent wtth metastatic 5'\\Uamous cell carcinoma, likely of \npulmonary origin. \n~ \nHave you cro&Hd a diagnostic thnsehold \n1~r for the lading hypothnle, hypercalcemla \nof malignancy (elaboration of PTHrP}1 HaWJ \nyou rul4'c:I out the ac:tMs altemativn? Do \nother tnte ll4led to be done to exclude the \nalternative diagnoeee? \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nAlternative Diagnosis: Local Osteolytic \nHypercalcemia of Malignancy \nTextbook Presentation \nSimilar to hypercalcemia. of malignancy cawed by PTHrP, hyper-\ncalcemia due to malignancies metastatic to bone generally presents \nin patients with previously diagnosed cancer. Breast cancer and \nplasma cell mydoma (discussed in detail here) are the most com-\nmon cawes. \nPlasma cell mydoma commonly presents with bone pain (often \nback pain), anemia., hypercalcemia., or acute kidney disease in \npatients in their 60s. Plain radiographs commonly demonstrate \nosteolytic lesions and the diagnosis is made by the demonstration \nof paraproteincmia and increased plasma cells on bone marro\nexam. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Plasma cell mydoma (and breast cancer) only cause hypercal-\ncemia after metastasizing to bone. \nB. The hypercalccmia is caused by local ostcolytic effects on \nbone. \nC. Plasma. cell mydoma. is caused by a malignant proliferation \nof plasma cells. The plasma cells wually secrete a single \nimmunoglobulin, or fragment of immunoglobulin, called \nthe M component (monoclonal component). \nD. Plasma cell mydoma most commonly affects patients in the \nseventh decade of life. Blacks are affected at twice the rate as \nwhites. \nE. Symptoms are varied and result from the effect of plasma cell \nproliferation on multiple systems. \n1. Anemia: Secondary to plasma cell inftltration of the bone \nmarrow. \n2. Infections: When the M component is excluded, patients \nwith mydoma usually have hypogammaglobulincmia. \n3. Bone pain and hypercalccmia.: Proliferation of plasma cells \nin the bone cawe osteolytic lesions. \n4. Kidney disease: Plasma cdl mycloma can cawe kidney \ndisease in multiple ways: \na. Light chains may injure the kidney via. toxicity to the \nrenal tubules or through obstruction secondary to the \nheavy burden of filtered protein. \nb. Hypercalcemia \nc. Amyloid deposition in the kidney \ncl. Urate nephropathy \nS. Serum hyperviscosity may occur from hypergammaglobu-\nlinemia; the most common sytnptoms arc headache and \nvisual disturbances. \n\n388 I CHAPTER 22 \nF. Symptoms at presentation as reported in 1 study of over \n1000 patients: \n1. Anemia was present in 73% of patients. The anemia was \nusually mild, normochromic, normocytic. \n2. 58% of patients had bone pain at presentation and 67% \nhad lyric bone lesions on radiographs. \n3. 19% had kidney disease \n4. 13% had hypercalcemia (> 11 mg/dL) \nS. M component \na. 82% of patients had an abnormal serum protein \nelectrophoresis. Of the 18% with a normal serum \nelectrophoresis, 97% had an abnormal urine \nprotein electrophoresis. \nb. The M component most commonly appears in the \ngamma range and is most commonly IgG. \nc. 16% have only free light chains. \n6. A sizable minority (36%) had a history of, or \npresence of, another plasma cell abnormality that \npredisposes to plasma cell myeloma (monoclonal \ngammopathy of unknown significance, plasmacytoma, \namyloidosis). \nG. Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) \n1. Commonly seen in older patients (- 3% of patients older \nthan 50 years) \n2. MGUS is diagnosed when there is M component present \non serum protein electrophoresis but the patient does not \nfulfil] criteria for myeloma (listed below). \n3. The M component is generally small,< 3 g/dL \n4. Patients with MGUS have an elevated risk of developing \nplasma cell myeloma (-1 %/year) \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma is based on the identifi-\ncation of bone marroplasmacytosis (> 10%) and one of the \nfollowing: \n1. Evidence of end-organ disease (anemia. hypercalcemia. \nkidney disease, or bone lesions) \n2. Biomarkers of malignancy such as clonal expansion of \nplasma cells or lyric bone lesions \nB. Clues to the diagnosis are the presence of normocytic anemia, \nbone pain, and elevated immunoglobulins. \nC. There are a feimportant issues that may confuse the \ndiagnosis. \n1. Filtered light chains are not detected on traditional urine \ndipsticks. A patient with light chain only myeloma may \nhave normal amounts of serum protein, a normal serum \nprotein electrophoresis and, apparently; no proteinuria. \nThe presence of a monoclonal gammopathy will be \ndetected only by urine protein electrophoresis. \n2. The bone lesions of plasma cell myeloma are almost \nexclusively osteolyric. They will usually be missed on bone \nscans but are seen on radiographs. \nTreatment \nIn all cases, treatment of the underlying malignancy is critical for \nmanaging hypercalcemia. Treatment of the hypercalcemia itself \nthat is due to local osteolytic metastases is the same as that for \nHHM discussed above. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Milk-Alkali Syndrome \nTextbook Presentation \nThere can be many presentations of the milk-alkali syndrome. \nAcute cases often present as hypercalcemia in women who use \ncalcium carbonate for dyspepsia or osteoporosis. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The milk-alkali syndrome is a syndrome ofhypercalcemia, \nmetabolic alkalosis, and acute kidney injury caused by the \ningestion of calcium and an absorbable alkali. \nB. The syndrome was first described as a complication of a pro-\nposed ulcer therapy that included high doses of magnesium \ncarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, bismuth subcarbonate, and \nabout 1 liter of a milk/cream mixture daily. \nC. The pathogenesis likely involves hypercalcemia secondary to \nthe ingestion followed by a resultant decrease in glomerular \nfiltration rate. The combination of acute kidney injury, \nhypercalcemia. hypovolemia, and alkali ingestion then \ncauses the metabolic alkalosis. \nD. The modern presentation of the milk-alkali syndrome \nincludes a wide range of calcium values, loto normal \nphosphate levels, moderate acute kidney injury (average \ncreatinine 4.2 mg/dL in a revieof modern, published \ncases), and calcium carbonate as the source of calcium \nand absorbable alkali. \nE. The milk-alkali syndrome is a distant third among the leading \ncauses of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients, after malig-\nnancy and primary hyperparathyroidism. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nThe diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome is based on history with \nsupporting laboratory test results (hypercalcemia, metabolic alka-\nlosis, and normal to loPTH). \nTreatment \nA. Cessation of calcium carbonate intake and hydration is usually \nsufficient treatment of milk-alkali syndrome. \nB. Caution should be taken when treating patients with severe \nmilk-alkali syndrome with fluid and loop diuretics. These \npatients appear to be at particular risk for subsequent, \ntransient, hypocalcemia. \nC. A subset of patients, possibly those with more prolonged or \nsevere disease complicated by hypovolemia, may never recover \nnormal kidney function. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nThe patient's laboratory test results follow: \nPTHrP: 3.3 pmol/L (nl 0-1.9 pmol/L) \nPTH: 13 ~/ml (nl < 60 pg/mL) \nMr5. W's hypercalcemla was diagnosed as HHM. She \nwas treated wit h zoledronlc acid and hydration. The pat ient \nopted to be t reated with palliat ive chemotherapy. Her con-\ndition declined markedly over the next 12 weeks. Treat-\nment was event ually discontinued and she died at home \n4 weeks later. \n\nBecause the patient had metastatic squamous cell lung cancer, her \nrapid decline was expected. The average life expectancy of patients \nwith squamous cell carcinoma and extensive disease is a little less \nthan 1 year and, as mentioned above, the presence of hypercalce-\nmia worsens the prognosis of a malignancy. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nSecondary & Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism \nDisease Highlights \nA. Secondary and teniary hyperparathyroidism occur in patients \nwithCKD. \nB. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is usually associated with \nhypocalcemia. It is most commonly caused by kidney disease, \nwhich causes an underproduction of 1,25 ,dihydroxy vitamin D \nwhich, in turn, causes hypocalcemia and a compensatory \nincrease in PTH. Therapy for the hyperphosphatemia associ-\nated with secondary hyperparathyroidism, however, can lead \nto hypercalcemia. \n1. Hyperphosphatemia develops in patients with CKD as the \nrenal clearance of phosphate falls. \n2. Early in the course of CKD, hypocalcemia, \nhypovitaminosis D, and hyperphosphatemia lead to \n(secondary) hyperparathyroidism. The elevated PTH \nis adaptive, increasing calcium release from bones and \nenhancing renal phosphate excretion. \n3. As CKD worsens, hyperparathyroidism becomes \ncounterproductive as the kidneys no longer respond to \nPTH by excreting phosphate while phosphate continues \nto be released, with calcium, from the bones. \n4. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD \na. Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate have been the \ntraditional first-line therapy for hyperphosphatemia in \nCKD. \n(I) Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate are effective \nphosphate binders, decreasing the gastrointestinal \nabsorption of phosphate. \n(2) Calcium-based phosphate binders rarely bring \nphosphate into the normal range and may cause \nhypercalcemia. \n(3) This hypercalcemia (and hyperphosphatemia) may \nbe exacerbated by exogenous calcitriol, also used to \ntreat secondary hyperparathyroidism. \n(4) The combination of high levels of calcium and \nphosphate have deleterious cardiovascular effects. \nb. Newer therapies offer alternatives for lowering \nphosphate without leading to hypercalcemia. \n(I) Sevelamer is a synthetic phosphate-binding polymer. \n(2) The calcium mimetics cinacalcet and etelcalcetide \ntarget the calcium-sensing receptor in the \nparathyroid glands, lowering PTH levels. \n(3) Newer vitamin D analogs may be able to lower \nPTH levels with less of a tendency to cause \nhypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. \nC. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid \nhyperplasia of secondary hyperparathyroidism becomes so \nsevere that PTH production becomes autonomous, causing \nHYPERCALCEMIA I 389 \nhypercalcemia beyond that expected by calcium and calcitriol \ntherapy. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. In patients with CKD, an elevated calcium level, usually in the \nsetting of calcium-based phosphate binders, and an elevated \nPTH, is diagnostic of secondary hyperparathyroidism. \nB. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed when PTH reaches \nhigher levels and does not respond to calcium supplementa-\ntion and vitamin D. \nTreatment \nA. The treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism is very com-\nplicated and is predicated on treating the factors that stimulate \nPTH secretion in CKD: hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, \nand hyperphosphatemia. \nB. Treatment involves phosphate binders, calcium andlor calci-\nmimetics, and vitamin D analogs in an effon to control the \nlevels of PTH, calcium, and phosphate. \nC. If tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs and is symptomatic \n(based on hypercalcemia, bone disease, metastatic calcifica-\ntions) parathyroidectomy is often required. \nREFERENCES \nBeall DP, Scofidd RH.

Howould ;you frame the \ndifferential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nFirst, what is normal BP, and when is a patient hypertensive? The \nfirst step is accuratdy measuring the BP. Table 23-1 summarizes \nguiddines for obtaining valid BP measurements. In addition to \nmeasurements taken during office visits, devices that measure BP \nat home are frequently used. Patients with these devices should be \nencouraged to bring them to office visits to ensure their accuracy \nand assess proper BP measurement technique. \nThe 2017 American College of Cardiology-American Heart \nAssociation (ACC/AHA) Hypertension Guiddine classifies BP as: \nA. Normal: systolic BP< 120 mm Hg and diastolic \nBP< 80 mm Hg \nB. Elevated: systolic BP 120-129 mm Hg and diastolic \nBP< 80 mm Hg \nC. Stage 1 hypertension: systolic BP 130- 39 mm Hg \nor diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg \nD. Stage 2 hypertension: systolic BP :I? 140 or diastolic \nBP~ 90 mm Hg \nUsing this definition, the prevalence of hyper-\ntension among adults in the United States is \napproximately 45%. \nHypertension is either primary (essential) or secondary \n(resulting from a specific identifiable cause). Causes of secondary \nhypertension can be organized using an organ/system framework: \nA. Primary (essential) hypertension \nB. Secondary hypertension \n1. Endocrine \na.

Patients between the ages of20 and 50 have about \ntwice the risk of devdoping hypertension if they have a first-degree \n\n392 I CHAPTER 23 \nTable 23-1. Guidelines for measuring BP. \n- The patient should sit with feet on the floor and back supported for \n> 5 minutes in a quiet room before BP measurements are taken. The \npatient should empty his/her bladder prior to measurement and \navoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 minutes before \nmeasurement. \n- Take at least 2 measurements spaced by 1-2 minutes and additional \nmeasurements If the first 2 are quite different. \n- Using a bladder that is too narroyields false high readings. Instead \nof the standard cuff (12-13 cm long, 35 cm wide) use an appropriate \nlarger cuff In patients with Increased ann circumference. \n- Use the onset of the first Korotkoff sound and disappearance of \nall Korotkoff sounds to Identify systolic and dlastollc BP values, \nrespectively. \n- Do not deflate the cuff too rapidly, otherwise individual Korotkoff \nsounds are missed and too loa value Is measured; start with a \ndeflation rate of 2 mm/s. \n- Measure the heart rate by palpation and watch out for arrhyth mla, \nwhich mandates repeated BP measurements. \n- At the first visit. measure BP in both arms and take the higher \nvalue as the reference; measure BP at 1 minute and s minutes after \nstanding upright ifthe patient has a disorder that frequently causes \northostatic hypotension. \nData from Whelton PK, Carey RM, AronoWS, et al: ACC/AHNMPNASC/ACPM/AGS/ \nAPhNASH/ASPC/NMNPCNA Guldellne for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, \nand Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults: A Report of the American College \nof Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines, \nHypertension. 2018Jun;71(6):e13~115. \nrelative with hypertension. Common conditions that can contrib-\nute to or cause hypertension include obesity, hyperthyroidism or \nhypothyroidism, acute kidney injury or CKD, excessive alcohol \nuse, sleep apnea, primary hyperaldosteronism (prevalence of \n5-10% in unselected populations and 20% in patients with resis-\ntant hypertension), and the use of drugs listed previously. Other \nsecondary causes are quite rare in unselected populations, with \nestimated prevalences of 0.18-4.4% for renovascular hyperten-\nsion, 0.04-0.2% for pheochromocytoma, and 0.3% for Cushing \nsyndrome.

Coexisting diabetes or \nobesity is common. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Patients who arc normotensive at age 55 have> 90% lifetime \nrisk of developing hypertension. \nB. Across the BP range of 115/75 mm Hg to 185/115 mm Hg, \neach increment of 20 mm Hg systolic BP or 10 mm Hg dia-\nstolic BP doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nThe evaluation of patients with hypertension focuses primarily on \nassessing other cardiovascular risk factors and assessing the presence \nor absence of target organ damage (TOD). Extensive testing for \nsecondary causes is generally not done unless the patient has spe-\ncHlc symptoms strongly suggestive of a specific secondary cause or \nif BP control cannot be achieved. Therefore, there are 3 objectives \nof testing in patients with hypertension: \nA. Objective 1: Assess presence or ab.cnce of TOD (Table 23-3). \nB. Objective 2: Assess presence or ab.ence of other \nc:ardiowscular risk factors. \n1. Smoking \n2. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) \nTable 23-3.

Objective 3: Identify secondary hypertension (Figure 23-1). \n1. In the absence of any of the clinical clues listed previously, \nit is unlikely that the patient has renal artery stenosis, \nhyperaldosteronism, or pheochromocytoma. \n2. Testing should focus on screening for more common \ncauses or contributors to hypertension, such as kidney \nor thyroid disease, that are easily diagnosed with simple \nblood tests. \nTreatment \nInitial testing in a patient with hypertension \nand no clinical clues should include an ECG, \nelectrolytes, BUN, creatinine, calcium, TSH, \nurine albumin-creatinine ratio, fasting glucose, \nand lipid panel (total cholesterol, high-density \nlipoprotein [HDL], triglycerides, low-density \nlipoprotein [LDL]). \nA. Goal l: Reduce BP to recommended target (2017 ACC/AHA \nHypertension Guideline}. \n1. The systolic BP goal is < 130 mm Hg in most patients. \na. In community-dwelling adults age 65 years or older, \na systolic BP goal of< 130 mm Hg has demonstrated \nimproved survival without significant increases \nin harm. \nb. In adults age 65 years or older with hypertension \nand a high burden of comorbiditics and limited life-\nexpectancy, higher BP targets (cg, 140-150 mm Hg} \nare reasonable to maximize quality of life and minimize \nadverse events. \n2. The diastolic BP goal is < 80 mm Hg in all patients. \n3. Lifestyle changes (Tables 23-4 and 23-5) should be \ninitiated in all patients with elevated BP or any grade of \nhypertension. \n4. A cardiovascular risk assessment should be performed to \nhelp guide subsequent treatment decisions. Patients with a \nhistory of precxisting CVD, diabetes mellitus, or CKD may \nbe assumed to have at least moderate cardiovascular risk. \nIn all other patients, or in patients where prior history is in \ndoubt, a 10-year cardiovascular risk assessment should be \nperformed. \na. Low-risk patients (elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension, \n10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] \nrisk< 10%, no TOD) should be given 3-6 months to \nachieve their target BP with lifestyle changes. \nb.

Selecting antihypertensive medication: general principles \na. Monotherapy is successful in a limited number \nof patients. \nb. Combining 2 agents from any 2 classes reduces BP more \nthan increasing the dose of a single agent. \n(1) Low-risk patients can be given 1 medication \ninitially. \n(2) Moderate- and high-risk patients may be given \n2 medications initially. \nc. Current randomized trial evidence docs not demonstrate \nmajor differences in clinical cardiovascular outcomes for \ndifferent antihypertensive classes. \nd. Some patients have specific conditions that guide \nmedication sdection. \ne. Diuretics (thiazidcs, chlorthalidone, and indapamide), \ndihydropyridine calcium antagonists, angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin \nreceptor blockers (ARBs) can all be used as initial \nmonotherapy in patients with no indications for specific \nagents. \n\nTable 23-4.

She could have resistant hyperten-\nsion, which is defined as a failure to reach a BP goal despite the \nuse of 3 optimally dosed antihypertensive medications of different \nclasses, ideally including a diuretic. Altemativdy, she could have \n\"pseudoresistance,\" meaning that her BP is uncontrolled due to \npoor BP measurement technique, poor adherence, white-coat effect, \nor an inadequate treatment regimen. The first steps in assessing \npatients with uncontrolled BP include repeating the BP measure-\nment with a properly sized cuff (if the cuff is too small, the systolic \nBP can be elevated as much as 15 mm Hg), reviewing medication \nadherence, obtaining home BP measurements, and reviewing the \nmedication regimen itsd Mrs. X is adherent to her medications, is \ntaking optimal doses of 3 medications from different classes includ-\ning a diuretic, and has consistent BP readings at home and in the \noffice. Thus, she meets the criteria for resistant hypertension. \nAfter establishing that a patient has resistant hypertension, the next \nstep is to consider the many potential causes (Table 23-8). Lifestyle \nfactors are common contributors to resistant hypertension. Elderly \npatients, black patients, and those with CKD tend to be particularly \nsalt sensitive. In an estimated 10% of adults with hypertension in the \nUnited States, the hypertension is due primarily to alcohol consump-\ntion. For every 10% increase in body weight, systollc BP increases \nby 6.5 mm Hg. Secondary causes of hypertension are also more \ncommon in patients with resistant hypertension; therefore, dements \nuncovered from a careful history and physical exam suggesting one \nof these diagnoses should prompt additional testing in these patients. \nThe clinical clues in Mrs. X's presentation include her vascu-\nlar risk factors and vascular disease, suggesting she is at risk for \nrenal artery stenosis. In addition, she does have preexisting CKD, \na common cause of resistant hypertension. Her obesiry is a risk \nfactor for obstructive sleep apnea, which is present in 60-70% of \npatients with resistant hypertension. Hyperaldosteronism should \nbe considered, since it is found in 7-20% of patients with resis-\ntant hypertension. She has no symptoms to suggest a rare cause \nof secondary hypertension, pheochromocytoma (0.1-0.6% of \npatients). Table 23-9 lists the differential diagnosis. \nTable 23-8.

The classic patient with ARAS has other vascular \ndisease {cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral \narterial disease) or risk factors such as smoking or diabetes. \n\nDisease Higb.lights \nA. Must distinguish renovascular disease from renovascular \nhypertension \n1. Rcnovascular disease means significant stenosis of I or both \nrenal arteries. \na. Can be due to fibromuscular dysplasia (most commonly \nin young women) or atherosclerosis (85% of cases) \n(1) ARAS is present in 1--6% of unselected patients with \nhypertension, with prevalence increasing with age. \n(2) ARAS is found in more than 30% of patients \nundergoing cardiac catheterization. \nb. Does not necessarily cause hypertension and can exist in \npatients with essential hypertension. \n2. Rcnovascular hypertension means hypertension caused by \nrenal hypoperfusion as a result of renal artery stenosis. \nB. About 50% of patients with renal artery stenosis have renovas-\ncular hypertension. \n1. Stenosis leads to renal ischemia, activating the renin-\nangiotensin system, which leads to release of renin and \nproduction of angiotensin II. \n2. Although plasma renin levels are high initially, they \ndecrease over time. \n3. Aldosterone secretion and vasoconstriction then occur, \nleading to hypertension. \n4. Aldosterone secretion also causes salt and water retention \nand hypokalemia. \nS. Ischemic nephropathy occurs when renal blood flois so \nreduced that GFR decreases and there is loss of kidney function. \n6. Some patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis present \nwith episodic, unexplained pulmonary edema (\"flash \npulmonary edema\"); echocardiograms in such patients \nshonormal systolic function. \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Clinical clues to identify patients with high risk of having ARAS \n1. Onset of hypertension before age 30, or onset of severe \nhypertension after age 55 \n2. Accelerated, resistant, or malignant hypertension \n3. Neazotemia or worsening kidney function after use of an \nACE inhibitor or ARB \na. A reversible increase in serum creatinine can develop \nin some patients with bilataal renal artery stenosis \n(or unilateral stenosis in patients with only 1 functioning \nkidney) when starting ACE inhibitor therapy. \n(1) The peak crcatinine occurs somewhere between \n4 days and 2 months. \n(2) Creatinine returns to baseline within I week of \nstopping the ACE inhibitor. \nb. One study reported that in a population ofhigh-\nrisk patients, a 20% increase in creatinine had I 00% \nsensitivity and 70% specificity for the diagnosis of renal \nartery stenosis (defined as> 50% bilataal stcnosis). \n4.

Should listen over all 4 abdominal quadrants and also spine \nand flanks between T12 and L2 \n2. Must differentiate between systolic bruits and continuous \n(systolic and diastolic) bruits \na. Systolic bruits occur in 4-20% of healthy persons, more \ncommonly in people under 40 years of age. \n(1) May originate from the celiac artery \n(2) Modestly increase the likelihood of renal artery \nstenosis: LR+, 4.3; LR-, 0.5 \nb. Continuous systolic-diastolic bruits often radiate to the \nside and strongly increase the likelihood of renal artery \nstenosis: LR+, 38.9; LR-, 0.6. \nC. Family history of hypertension is often absent. \nD. Hypokalemia is often seen as a result of stimulation of \naldosterone release; metabolic alkalosis is also often seen. \nE. Imaging studies \n1. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography is the gold \nstandard. \na. Can also be therapeutic through performance of \nangioplasty or placement of stent in the rare cases this \nis indicated \nb. Complications include bleeding, dissection, \nembolization, and contrast nephropathy. \n2. Duplex ultrasonography (2-dimensional ultrasound \nimaging combined with Doppler flomeasurements) \na. Results can vary depending on the level of experience \nof the technician and the body habitus of the patient. \nb. Accuracy ranges from 60% to 90%. \nc. In optimal circumstances, sensitivity is 85% and \nspecificity is 92% (LR+, 10; LR-, 0.16). \n3. Magnetic resonance angiography with gadolinium \na. The largest single study found that for ARAS the \nsensitivity was 78% and specificity was 88% (LR+ 6.5; \nLR-, 0.25); for fibromuscular dysplasia, the sensitivity \nwas only 22% but the specificity was 96%. \nb.

In the large study noted above, for ARAS, the sensitivity \nwas 77% and specificity was 94% (LR+ 12.8; LR-, 0.24); \nfor flbromuscular dysplasia, the sensitivity was 28% and \nspecificity was 99%. \nc. Smaller studies report sensitivities and specificities \nover90%. \nTreatment \nA. All patients with ARAS should have optimal medical therapy \nwith ACE inhibitors or ARBs, statins, and aspirin. \nB. Most patients require multiple antihypertensive medications \nto reach BP goals. \nC. Patients should stop smoking, and diabetes should be optimally \ncontrolled. \n\n400 I CHAPTER 23 \nD. The role of renal anery revascularization is limited. \n1. Randomized, controlled trials have not shown that stenting \nis better than medical therapy with regard to preventing \nprogression of kidney disease or cardiovascular events. \n2. ACC/AHA guidelines recommend considering revasculari-\nzation in patients with hemodynamically significant bilateral \nARAS (or unilateral in patients with 1 kidney) and recurrent, \nunexplained heart failure or pulmonary edema. Other \npotential indications include progressive CKO, resistant or \naccelerated hypertension, and unstable angina. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nAfter you explain that most patients with ARAS are \ntreated with aspirin, statlns, and good BP control, Mrs. X \ndeclines any lm~lng studies. \nHave you crosead a dlagn09tlc; threshold \nfor the leading hypothesis, renovascular \nhyper-tension? Have you ruled out the active \nalternatives? Do other taste need to be dons \nto exclude the alternative diagnoses? \nWorsening CKD, lifestyle factors, and medications/drugs have \nbeen ruled out by the history and unchanged serum creatinine. \nPrimary hyperaldosteronism needs to be considered in patients \nwith resistant hypertension, especially those with hypokalemia. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Primary \nHyperaldosteronism \nTextbook Presentation \nPrimary hyperaldosteronism is usually diagnosed when a patient \nwith hypertension has unexplained hypokalemia or when a patient \nhas resistant hypertension. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Etiology \n1. Results from an idiopathic bilateral adrenal hyperplasia in \nmost patients (60-65%) \n2. Results from unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma in \n30-40% of cases (Conn syndrome) \n3. Rarer causes include microadenomas, unilateral adrenal \nhyperplasia, and adrenal carcinoma. \nB. The overall prevalence, based on community cohorts, is about \n5-10%. \n1. Found in 17-23% of patients with resistant hypertension \n2. Prevalence of 34% in patients newly diagnosed with \nhypertension and obstructive sleep apnea who were referred \nto a tertiary care center \nC. Pathophysiology \n1. High aldosterone levels lead to salt and water retention and \npotassium wasting. \n2. Because aldosterone is being produced autonomously, it is \nnot suppressed by volume expansion, as it is normally. \n3. Volume expansion suppresses plasma renin levels. \nD. Most patients have a normal potassium level; 48% of those \nwith aldosterone-producing adenomas and 17% of those with \nbilateral adrenal hyperplasia are hypokalernic. \n~ \nA normal potassium levd does not rule out \n,,.... hyperaldosteronism. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosi5 \nA. The Endocrine Society recommends screening for primary \nhyperaldosteronism in patients with the following: \n1. Sustained BP> 150/100 mm Hg \n2. Resistant hypertension \n3. Hypertension and spontaneous or diuretic-induced \nhypokalemia \n4. Hypertension and sleep apnea \n5. An adrenal incidentaloma \n6. A family history of early-onset hypertension \n7. Cerebrovascular accident at < 40 years of age \nB. There are 3 steps in the diagnosis of primary hyperaldostero-\nnism: screening, confirmatory testing, and determining \nthe subtype. \n1. The plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin \nactivity ratio (ARR) is the most commonly used screening \ntest; since patients with primary hyperaldosteronism have \nelevated levels of aldosterone and suppressed renin levels, \nthe ratio should be elevated. \na. The ARR can be affected by potassium status, dietary \nsodium, medications, and age. \nb. Ideally, prior to measurement, the patient should have a \nnormal potassium level and liberal sodium intake. \nc. Medications that minimally affect aldosterone levels \ninclude verapamil, hydralazine, and alpha-adrenergic \nblockers; other antihypertensive medications and \nNSAIDs should be stopped fur 2-4 weeks when \npossible. \nd. The optimal cut point is unclear; a ratio > 20-30 is \ngenerally considered a positive test. \ne. Sensitivity ranges from 73% to 87%, with a specificity \nof about 75%. \n2. If the ARR is abnormal, the patient should be referred to \nan endocrinologist for confirmatory testing (oral sodium \nloading, saline infusion, fludroconisone suppression, or \ncaptopril challenge). \n3. Patients with abnormal confirmatory testing should undergo \nadrenal CT, possibly followed by adrenal vein sampling. \nTreatment \nA. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy should be considered when \nlateralized aldosterone excess is demonstrated by adrenal \nvein sampling. \nB. Otherwise, treat with spironolactone (an aldosterone antagonist). \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. X has an elevated ARR; however. confirmatory test-\ning by the endocrinologist is negative. You stop t he hydro-\nchlorothlazlde, substituting chlorthalidone, a longer acting \ndiuretic. Her BP Improves slightly, and she requires t he \naddition of splronolactone to achieve her BP goal. \n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. J is a 45-year-old man with a 10-year history of hyper-\ntension. When you last sahim 1 year ago, his BP was \n160/95 mm Hg. He ran out of his medications 6 months \nago and was unable to obtain refills because of financial \nproblems. Today, he has stopped by to see your nurse for \nneprescriptions. Because he is complaining ofa headache, \nshe checks his BP and then runs to find you because rt Is \n220/112 mm Hg. \nAt thie point, what ie ths lsading hypothseie, \nwhat ans ths actlvs altsmatlvse, and le \nthsrs a must not miss dlagnosls1 Glvsn this \ndlffeNntlal dlagnoels, what tsets &hould bs \nordersd? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. ]'s BP clearly needs to be lowered, and the primary question \nis hoquickly this needs to be accomplished. In other words, is \nthis a hypertensift emergency or hypertensift urgency? These \nsyndromes arc: dc:flnc:d by the degree of BP elevation and whc:thc:r \nthere is acute end organ damage. \nA hypertensive emergency exists when there is severe BP ele-\nvation and acute target organ involvement: acute neurologic syn-\ndromes (encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accident, intracerc:bral or \nsubarachnoid hc:morrhagc:), acute: aortic dissection, acute: coronary \nsyndrome, acute: pulmonary edc:ma, acute: kidney injury, severe: \nprec:clampsia/c:clampsia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, or \nacute postoperative hypertension. \nIn hypertensive urgency, there is severe BP elevation with-\nout any acute: TOD. The: exact definition of \"severe: BP eleva-\ntion\" has not been established, but many experts use a cutoff of \n> 180/ 110-120 mm Hg. Common causes of hypc:rtc:nsivc: urgency \nand emergency include medication nonadherence, abrupt cessation \nof clonidine, CKD, renovascular disease, drugs (cocaine, PCP), \nsystemic lupus c:rythc:matosus, c:clampsia, and postoperative state; \nCushing disease and pheochromocytoma are less common causes. \nA hypertensive emergency is dc:flned by the \npresence ofTOD, not by the: dc:grc:c: of BP \nelevation. \nTo some: extent, the: dc:grc:c: of the: acute: TOD in patients with \nvery elevated BP depends on the time course of the BP elevation. \nFor example, normotensive women in whom acute hypertension \ndevelops from eclampsia can have significant TOD at pressures of \n160/100 mm Hg, whereas patients with chronic hypertension can \nbe: asymptomatic at much higher pressures. So, despite: his vc:ry \nelevated BP, it is quite: likely that Mr. J falls into the: \"hyperten-\nsive urgency\" rather than the \"hypertensive emergency\" category. \nNevertheless, hypertensive emergency is alwa~ the \"must not \nmiss\" diagnosis in such patients (Table 23-10). \n\nYou tell the nurse to put Mr. J In an exam room. On fur-\nther history, he has no shortness of breath, chest pain, \nedema, abdominal pain, feelings of confusion, vomiting, or \nfocal weakness or numbness. He generally appears well and \nis clearly happy to have a nejob. Physical exam confirms \nHYPERTENSION I 401 \nTable 23-10.

Prevalence of hypertensive urgency in the: outpatient setting or \nemergency department is 3-5%. \nB. The most common presenting symptoms are headache (22%), \nepistaxis (17%), faintness (10%), psychomotor agitation \n(10%), chest pain (9%), and d~pnea (9%). \nC. One large retrospective cohort study found that the: risk of a \ncardiovascular event occurring within 6 months is ~ 1 %. \nEvidence--Based Diagnosis \nA. Must rule out acute TOD through history, physical, and \nselected laboratory tests. \n\n402 I CHAPTER 23 \nB. BP should be measured in both arms, and pulses palpated in \nboth the upper and lower extremities; all patients should have \na complete cardiovascular and neurologic exam, including \nfundoscopic exam. \nC. All patients should have a serum creatinine and urinalysis \nperformed. \nD. Patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia or \npulmonary edema should have an ECG, chest radiograph, and \ncardiac enzymes. \nE. Patients with neurologic signs or symptoms need CNS imaging \n(CTor MRI). \nTreatment \nA. In stable outpatients with chronically elevated BP, there is not \nan urgent need to reduce the BP, and it is fine if it takes several \ndays for the BP to be reduced. \nB. There are several ways to approach treatment, depending on \nthe overall condition of the patient, whether the patient has \nbeen treated previously, and the ability of the patient to return \nfor follow-up. \n1. In patients who have stopped their medications, it is \nusually sufficient just to restart them. \n2. In previously untreated patients, options include \na. Starting 2 long-acting agents, such as a diuretic and \neither a calcium channel blocker or ACE inhibitor \nb. Beginning treatment with more rapid-acting \nagents, such as oral labetalol or clonidine, and then \ntransitioning to longer acting agents; patients can be \nobserved for several hours to assess their response to \nthe short-acting agents. \nC. Too rapid reduction of BP can lead to hypotension and \ncerebral hypoperfusion with stroke. \nD. N and sublingual medications can have unpredictable effects \non BP and should be avoided in asymptomatic patients. \n1. IV hydralazine causes a progressive and sometimes \nprecipitous fall in BP 10-30 minutes after administration. \n2. Sublingual nifedipine causes unpredictable lowering of BP \nand should never be used. \n~ \nDo not be in a hurry to normalize BP in \ny \npatients without acute TOD! \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. J's serum c;reatlnlne Is 1.4 m{:!/dL, unchan9ed from \n1 year a90. Hie urinalysis Is normal. Mr. J wants to knoIf \nhe can have a couple of acetaminophen tablets for his head-\nache, 9et his prescriptions, and leave; he has to pick up his \nson at school. \nHave you oroeeed a diagnoetic; th1'8ehold for \nthe IHding h)'pO'thHie, hYf\"'!\"t8neive urgency7 \nHave you ruled out the ac:tive alternativee1 \nDo other teete nNd to be done to fJXCludfJ the \nalternative diagnosee1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Hypertensive \nEmergencies \nPatients with hypertensive emergencies frequently present with \nchest pain (27%), dyspnea (22%), and neurologic deficits (21 %). \nCerebral infarction is found in about 24% of patients, with about \n22% having pulmonary edema, 16% hypertensive encephalopathy, \nand 12% heart failure. \nAcute coronary syndromes, aortic dissection, subarachnoid \nhemorrhage, and pulmonary edema are discussed in other chapters. \nThis section focuses on hypertensive encephalopathy. \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients present with the acute or subacute development oflethargy, \nconfusion, headache, and visual disturbances, sometimes followed \nby seizures (focal or generalized) and coma. The syndrome can \noccur with or without proteinuria and retinopathy. \nDisease Highlights \nA Cerebral blood flois autoregulated within specific limits. \n1. In normotensive people, cerebral blood flois unchanged \nbetween mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 50-150 mm Hg \n(MAP = [(2 x diastolic) + systolic]/3) \na. Cerebral vasoconstriction limits hyperperfusion up to a \nMAP of~ 150 mm Hg. \nb. Above a MAP of 150 mm Hg, autoregulation is \noverwhelmed. \n2. In hypertensive patients, cerebral blood flocan be \nmaintained at higher MAPs. \na. Thought to be due to arteriolar thickening \nb. Such patients also need higher MAPs to maintain \nadequate cerebral blood flo(ie, abrupt lowering of the \nBP to a MAP of < 100-110 mm Hg can potentially lead \nto cerebral ischemia). \nB. Failure of autoregulation leads to cerebral vasodilation, \nendothelial dysfunction, and cerebral edema. \nC. Vasogenic edema in the posterior parietal and/or occipital \nlobes \n1. Classic MRI finding in hypertensive encephalopathy, \nalthough a wide range of findings is possible \n2. Also called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome \n3. Generally seen in the posterior regions of the brain \ndue to relatively sparse sympathetic innervation of the \nvertebrobasilar territory leading to more disruption of \nautoregulatory mechanisms, increased perfusion, and \nedema \n4. Also seen with eclampsia and use of some \nimmunosuppressive agents and cytotoxic drugs; in 1 series, \n68% of patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome had hypertension, 11 % eclampsia, 11 % \nimmunosuppressive use, and 11 % other causes \n5. Reversible with treatment of hypertension or removal of \ninciting agent, with MRI findings resolving in days to \nweeks; long-term antiepileptic therapy is not necessary. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA Hypertensive encephalopathy is primarily a clinical diagnosis; \nimaging is required to rule out CNS abnormalities. \nB. A head CT should be done to exclude intracranial hemorrhage \n(intracerebral or subarachnoid bleeding). \n\nC. An MRI should be done to exclude acute ischemic: stroke and \nto look for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. \nTreatment \nMRI is much more sensitive than CT (83% vs \n16% sensitivity; specificity of both> 95%) fur \nthe diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. \nA. Hypertensive encephalopathy and other hypertensive emer-\ngencies should be treated in the ICU with parenteral, titratable \nantihypertensive agents. \nB. There is little evidence to guide the choic:e of agents; \ncommonly used medications include labetalol, esmolol, \nfenoldopam, clevidipine, nitroprusside, and nic:ardipine. \nC. Generally, the BP should be reduced by no more than 25% \nin the first hour, then to 160/100 mm Hg within the next \n2-6 hours; patients can often be transitioned to oral agents \nwithin 12-24 hours. \n1. The BP should be reduced more quickly if hypertensive \nemergency is accompanied by acute aortic dissection, with \na goal of< 120/80 mm Hg during the first hour. \n2. Neurology consultation should be obtained for guidance \nregarding BP lowering in the setting of acute stroke. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nMr. J ha5 no 5lgn5 or 5ymptom5 of 5troke. lntracranlal hem-\norrhage, pulmonary edema, myocardial i5Ghemia, or aortic \ndi5ooctlon. He ha5 a mlld headache, 1:7ut he doe5 not have \nother symptoms, such as lethargy or confusion, to suggest \nhypertensive encephalopathy. His kidney function is stable, \nand his urinalysis is normal. There is no need to perform any \nfurther te5tlng at thl5 point. \nMr. J's previous regimen was hydrochlorothiazi.de, 25 mg: \nlisinopril 40 mg; and amlodipine, 10 mg. You instruct him to \nfill his prescriptions after he picks up his son at school, to take \nthe amlodipine tonight, and then to take all 3 medications in the \nmorning. When he returns in 2 days, his BP is 160/100 mm Hg; \n3 weeks later it is 145/90 mm Hg. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nPheochromocytoma \nTatbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is a patient with attacks of paroxysmal \nhypertension, headache, palpitations, and sweating occurring \nseveral times daily, weekly, or every femonths. Patients generally \nhave orthostatic: hypotension on physical exam. \nDiseases Highlights \nA. 85-90% of patients have headache, sweating, or palpitations. \nB. 10% of pheochromocytomas are malignant and tend to have a \nless typical presentation. \nC. 10-15% are familial (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von \nHippd-Lindau disease, neuroflbromatosis); these are more \noften asymptomatic (and normotensive) than sporadic cases. \nHYPERTENSION I 403 \nTable 23-11.

The beta-blocker opposes the reflex tachycardia that occurs \nwith alpha-blockade. \n3. Unopposed beta-blockade causes inhibition of epinephrine-\ninduced vasodilation, leading to increased BP, left heart \nstrain, and possibly heart failure. \n4, Should be done in consultation with an endocrinologist \nbecause of the complexities of ensuring adequate \nalpha-blockade \nNever give a patient with a pheochromocy-\ntoma a beta-blocker without first giving an \nalpha-blocker. \nC. 25% of patients have residual hypertension. \nD. Patients with familial pheochromocytoma often have multiple, \nbilateral tumors; the optimal approach to therapy is not clear. \nGenetic testing may be considered. \nREFERENCES \nAbulWuna AF, Yacoub M.

Stern, MD \nHYPONATREMIA \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. P is a 66-year-old man who comes to the emergency \ndepartment with a chief complaint of an lnabllltyto urinate. \nShortly after arrival he has a qe:nerallzed seizure. Initial labs \nreveal a serum sodium concentration of 122 mEtl,fL. \n~ \nWhat are the symptoms of hyponatremla1 \n1~r What Is the differential diagnosis of \nhyponatremia1 Howould you frame the \ndiffensntial1 \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAs noted in Chapter 1, the frrst task when evaluating patients is to \nidentify their problem(s). Mr. P's problems clearly include seizure, \nmarked hyponatremia, and inability to urinate. While other causes \nof seizures must be considered, the hyponatremia clearly requires \nevaluation because it is severe, potentially life-threatening, and \nlikely to have caused the seizure. \nHyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormal-\nity in hospitalized patients and associated with an increase in \nmortality that is profoundly modifled by the underlying cause \nof hyponatremia. It is defined as a serum sodium concentration \n< 135 mEq/L and is classified as mild (130-135 mmol/L), moder-\nate (125-129 mmol/L), or profound(< 125 mmol/L). \nSymptoms of Hyponatremia \nThe adverse effects and manifestations of hyponatremia depend \non its severity and rapidity of development. Acute hyponatremia \n(defined as developing within the prior 48 h) leaves the brain \nhypertonic relative to the hypotonic serum. This osmotic gradient \ndrives water into the brain's astrocytes, resulting in cerebral edema \nand CNS symptoms. Acute hyponatremia may cause seizures, brain \ndamage, brainstem herniation, respiratory arrest, rhabdomyolysis \nand death. Symptoms occur at much more modest degrees of \nhyponatremia than in patients with chronic hyponatremia. Seizures \ncan occur even at sodium levels above 120 mEq/L. On the other \nhand, in chronic hyponatremia (most cases), CNS adaptations \noccur. Astrocytes decrease their intracellular osmolality, decreasing \nthe osmotic flux of water into the brain in turn causing less cerebral \nedema. Therefore, symptoms tend to develop when hyponatremia \nis more severe than in patients with acute hyponatremia. Seizures \nand herniation are much less frequent. Typically, patients with \nchronic hyponatremia and serum sodium levels > 130 mEq/L are \nasymptomatic. Symptoms associated with profuund hyponatremia \n(< 125 mEq/L) include nausea (44--49%), vomiting (27-30%), \ngait disturbance (31 %), headache 27%, confusion (14-30%), \nseizures (5%), and coma. \nBefure reviewing the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia, \nit is useful to briefly reviethe pathophysiology of normal water \nhandling, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and then hyponatremia. \nADH plays a key role in water handling. \nIn health, dehydration increases the serum sodium and \nosmolality and triggers ADH release. This causes water channels \n(aquaporins) to be inserted into the luminal membrane of the col-\nlecting ducts, promoting water reabsorption. This restores normal \nosmolality and sodium concentration. Conversely, excessive water \ningestion lowers the serum sodium and osmolality suppressing \nADH secretion and results in the removal of the aquaporins. This \nprevents water reabsorption, promotes its excretion and restores \nthe normal osmolality and sodium concentration. \nHyponatrtrnia occurs when water accumulates in excess of \nsodium due to an inability to excrete ingested water and in most \npatients, develops due to an excess of ADH. The excessive ADH \nrelease causes persistent, sustained, and inappropriate water reab-\nsorption, diluting the serum sodium (and also simultaneously con-\ncentrating the urine). In order to understand the states ofincreased \nADH it is critical to appreciate the triggers of ADH release. ADH \nis obviously released in response to an increase in osmolallty but is \nalso secreted in response to critical hypovolemia (in an attempt to \nreabsorb water and volume). The hypovolemia can be either real \nhypovolemia (as in hemorrhagic shock) or perceived hypovolemia, \nsuch as when there is an ineffective circulating volume (eg, from \nsevere heart failure [HF]). In addition to these appropriate causes \nof ADH release, ADH secretion may be inappropriate, causing the \nsyndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH). In SIADH, tumors \nand other diseases cause the release of ADH that is triggered by \nneither an increase in osmolality nor a decrease in the effective cir-\nculating volume. Finally, hyponatremia develops in some patients \ndespite an appropriate suppression of ADH due to the rapid inges-\ntion of such excessive amounts of water that they are unable to \nexcrete it. This is referred to as water intoxication. \nThe differential diagnosis for hyponatremia is long, but the \ndiagnostic approach can be easily framed in a fesimple steps. \nThese pivotal steps include (1) a quick search fur highly diagnos-\ntic clues; (2) a clinical assessment of the patient's volume status to \nlimit the differential; (3) in clinically euvolemic patients, a revie\nof their urine sodium to detect subtle hypovolemia, and finally, \n(4) evaluate truly euvolemic patients for hypothyroidism and \nadrenal insufficiency prior to diagnosing SIADH. Each of these \nsteps is discussed below. \nThe first step recognizes that a fekey clinical and laboratory \nfeatures immediately suggest very specific diagnoses (Figure 24-1). \nExamples of these include marked hyperglycemia suggesting \nhyperglycemic-induced hyponatremia, thiazide use (suggesting \ndiuretic-induced hyponatremia), recent participation in marathon \n\n406 I CHAPTER 24 \nHyponateremia \nStep 1 : Search for specific clu \nHistory: Thiazides, recent \nparty, marathon \nLabs: Glucose, creatinine, \npotassium, serum and urine \nosmolallty \nNone \nGo to Figure 24-2 \nMarked \nhyperglyoemia \nThlazide use \nUrine Osm < 100 \nMarkedly elevated \ncreatinine \nHyperkalemla \nUnexplained \nhypoglycemia \nNormal or elevated \nserum osmolalty \nVery recent \nmarathon \nRecent \"party\" \nHyperglycemic-induced \nhyponatremia \nConsider diuretic-induced \nhyponatremia 1 \nConsider water intoxication: \n- Psychogenic polydipsia \n- Ecstasy use \n- Beer potomanla \n- Exercise-associated \nhyponatremia \nKidney failure \nConsider \nPrimary adrenal insufficiency \nConsider \nPseudohyponatremia \n- Marked hyperllplclemla \n- Marked hyperprotelnemla \nExercise-associated \nhyponatremia \nConsider Ecstasy use \n1Patients taking thiazides can occasionally have other causes of hyponatremia and should be re-evaluated if their serum sodium fails to \nimprove after discontinuation of diuretics. \nFigure 24-1. Step 1: Look for highly suggestive diagnostic clues. \nevents (suggesting exercise-associated hyponatremia [EAH]), \nhyperkalemia (suggesting kidney failure or primary adrenal insuf-\nficiency), very lourine osmolality (suggesting water intoxication \nfrom either psychogenic polydipsia, Ecstasy use, or beer potomania), \nnormal serum osmolality (suggesting pseudohyponatremia) or recent \nattendance at a party, rave etc. (suggesting possible Ecstasy use). \nFor many patients, the previously mentioned clues are absent and \nthe second pivotal step evaluates the patient's clinical volume status \nin order to determine whether they are clinically hypervolernic, \nhypovolemic, or euvolemic. This allows the differential diagnosis to \nbe narrowed to that appropriate subset of diagnoses (Figure 24-2). \nCorrect classification of the patient's volume status requires a revie\nof their history, physical exam findings, and laboratory results. The \nclinical recognition of hypervolemic patients is usually straightforward \nbecause hyponatremia typically develops in patients with advanced \nHF. cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and kidney failure when the \ndisease is easily recognized. Conversdy, hypotension or orthostasis \nsuggests hypovolemia. Patients who are neither hypervolemic nor \nhypovolernic are classified as clinically euvolemic. \nThe third pivotal step evaluates patients who appear clinically \neuvolemic. Surprisingly, some patients who appear clinically \neuvolemic are, in fact, hypovolemic. Here, the measurement of the \nurine sodium can be hdpful. Since hypovolemia promotes avid \nsodium reabsorption within the kidney, hypovolemia is usually asso-\nciated with a lourinary sodium concentration(< 20-30 mEq/L). \nOn the other hand, euvolemic patients do not have a stimulus to \nreabsorb urine sodium and usually have a higher urinary sodium \n(> 20-30 mEq/L). Therefore, a lourine sodium in such patients \nconfirms hypovolemia and an elevated urine sodium confirms \neuvolemia (Figure 24-3). \n\nHYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA I 401 \nPlvotal Step 2: Evaluate patient' cllnlcal volume status \nHl1tory: HF, liver or kidney disease, volume loss, vomiting, diarrhea \nPhyalcal exam: Vital signs, orthostatic BP and pulse, edema, JVD, S3 gallop, \ncrackles, and ascites \nI \nHypotension \nor orthostatic \nchanges \nNo evidence of \nhypovolemia or \nhypervolemia \nI \nSignificant edema, \nJVD, S3 gallop \norascites \nHypovolemla \nCllnlc:al auvolamla \nSee Figure 24-3 \nHypervolemia \nDlffarantlaldlagnaela \n- Salt and water loss (vomiting/diarrhea) \nwith free water intake \n- Primary adrenal insufficiency \n- Diuretics \nHF, heart failure; JVD, Jugular venous distention. \nDifferential dlagnoala \n- Cirrhosis \n- HF \n- Nephrotic syndrome \n- Kidney failure \nFigure 24-2.

Step 3: Evaluate clinical euvolemia to distinguish true euvolemia from subtle \nhypovolemia. \nThere are a feexceptions that should be kept in mind when \ninterpreting the urinary sodium in patients who appear clinically \neuvolemic. \nFirst, several hypovolemic conditions are associated with an \nincreased urinary sodium loss, which can be misleading. Diuretics \ncan force urinary sodium excretion despite hypovolemia. Therefore, \nwhile a lourinary sodium in a patient taking diuretics still sug-\ngests hypovolemia, an devated urine sodium cannot be interpreted. \nHypoaldosttronism impairs sodium reabsorption and causes both \nhypovolemia and increased urinary sodium losses. \nSecond, several euvolemic states may be associated with lo\nurinary sodium concentrations. Patients with SIADH may ingest \n\n408 I CHAPTER 24 \nlittle sodium and occasionally have a lourinary sodium measure-\nment (despite euvolemia). Patients with water intoxication (due to \npsychogenic polydipsia, Ecstasy use, or EAH) may also have a lo\nurinary sodium concentration because the massive water ingestion \n(and excretion) dilutes the excreted sodium and lowers its concen-\ntration. These will usually be identified in the first pivotal step by \nfinding a maximally dilute urine (urine osmolality < 100 mOsm/L). \nThe final pivotal step evaluates these truly euvolemic hypona-\nttemic patients. Most such patients have SIADH. However, before \nmaking this diagnosis, severe hypothyroidism and adrenal insuffi-\nciency must be ruled out (Figure 24-4). \nIt is important to mention a fepotential pitfalls. First, the \nurine sodium should not be measured in clinically hypervolnnic \npatients. Hypervolemia in such patients is associated with an \nineffective circulating volume, which triggers not only ADH rdease \nbut also promotes avid sodium reabsorption, thereby lowering \ntheir urinary sodium. This finding could mislead clinicians into \nmisclassifying these patients as hypovolemic. \nSecond, a response to a saline challenge is occasionally diagnos-\ntically hdpful but potentially dangerous. In hypovolemic hypona-\nttemic patients, ADH secretion is triggered by the hypovolemia. \nThe saline challenge can restore the intravascular volume, suppress \nADH secretion, and promote a brisk water diuresis. This may \ncause a dangerously rapid rise in the serum sodium putting patients \nat risk for devdoping the osmotic demydinization syndrome, a \nsevere life-threatening complication of therapy (see bdow). On the \nEuvolamla \nother hand, the opposite can happen in patients with SIADH. In \nSIADH, ADH secretion continues despite the sodium challenge. \nThis causes the water from the saline to be retained, whereas the \nsodium is excreted. This can cause a paradoxical fall in the serum \nsodium from the normal saline challenge, which can worsen CNS \nsymptoms. Consultation is advised. \nThe differential diagnosis of hyponattemia classified by volume \nstatus is listed bdow. \nDifferential Diagnosis of Hyponatrcmia \nA Hypervolemia \n1. HF \n2.

His normal potassium does not suggest adrenal insufficiency \nand his loserum osmolality confirms hypotonic hyponatremia \nruling out pseudohyponatremia. However, his urine osmolality \nis exceptionally loand is a pivotal clue. Since ADH (whether \nappropriate or inappropriate) promotes water reabsorption from \nthe urine, it also acts to increase the urine osmolality. His maxi-\nmally dilute urine (< 100 mOsm) suggests that ADH is actually \nsuppressed and that the hyponatremia is due to a different mecha-\nnism, specifically some form of water intoxication. Causes of water \nintoxication include psychogenic polydipsia, recent marathon, \nbeer potomania, or Ecstasy use. Given his jogging attire, you sus-\npect EAH. Table 24-1 lists the differential diagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: Exercise-Associated \nHyponatremia (EAH) \nTextbook Presentation \nEAH usually presents in patients during or within hours of com-\npleting an endurance event (marathon) who have ingested exces-\nsive amounts of free water. Symptoms range from weakness and \nnausea to coma, seizures, and death. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Defined as hyponatremia occurring within 24 hours of \nphysical activity. \nB. Typically follows prolonged workouts of any kind, including \nhalf marathons, marathons, ultramarathons, sprint and full \nironman events, football players, endurance cycling, and \nswimming events. \nC. The incidence varies widely. The overall rate of hyponatremia \nhas been reported at 6% of participants, with symptomatic \nhyponatremia occurring in 1 %. \nD. Secondary to a combination of both excessive fluid intake \ncombined in some patients with inappropriate ADH release \n1. The leading risk factor is sustained excessive intake of \nhypotonic fluid in excess of fluid losses as manifested by \nweight gain during the event. Hyponatremia developed \n\n410 I CHAPTER 24 \nin 17% of runners who gained > 2 kg during the race, \ncompared with < 2% of runners who gained < 2 kg. \na. Other risk factors include long exercise duration and \nslorunning pace. \nb. Ingestion of excessive water or carbohydrate sports drinks \ncan both produce EAH. (Carbohydrate sports drinks are \nstill markedly hypotonic compared with plasma.} \n2. Hyponatremia should suppress ADH. The finding that \n44% of runners with EAH did not have maximally dilute \nurine suggests that SIADH contributes to hyponatremia \nin some patients. \nE. The key to understanding EAH is that it develops rapidly \nunlike most other causes ofhyponatrcmia. \n1. The rapid development causes more severe symptoms at \nlesser degrees of hyponatremia. Falls in serum sodium of \n7-10% can produce symptoms resulting in symptomatic \nhyponatremia even in patients with sodium levels of \n125-130 mEq/L. \n2. The rapid onset of hyponatremia renders the plasma \nhypotonic relative to the brain, (which still has normal \nosmolality), leading to an osmotic influx of water into \nthe brain and cerebral edema. \nF. Hyponatremia and cerebral edema cause neurologic \nsymptoms, including confusion, headaches, vomiting, \nseizures, coma, herniation, and death. Symptoms may not \noccur immediately but develop over the first 24 hours. \nG. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can occur in patients \nwithEAH. \nTreatment \nA. Prevention \n1. Athletes should be advised to weigh themselves before \nand after exercise and counseled to avoid excessive weight \ngain (> 2 kg). \nTable 24-2. Hyponatremia: approach to treatment. \nGoals \nSeverely symptomatlc1 ' \nacute hyponlltremla2 \nUrgent increase 4-6 mEq/L s 6h \nMeasure serum sodium hourly until goal met \n2. Thirst should be used as a guide to drinking during \nmarathon events rather than fixed, regular, fluid intake. \n3. Sporadic weight checks during endurance events could also \ndetect athletes with significant weight gain at risk for EAH. \nB. Treatment \n1. Individuals who collapse or have neurologic symptoms \nduring or following endurance events should be immediately \nevaluated for EAH (as well as hypernatremia, hyperthermia, \nhypoglycemia, and myocardial infarction}. \n2. It is critical to appreciate that the treatment of acute \nhyponatremia is different from that of chronic hyponatremia \n(Table 24-2). The hyponatremia in EAH develops rapidly \nand an aggressive approach to correction and treatment is safe \nand recommended. This contrasts with most hyponatremic \npatients who have chronic hyponatremia, in whom rapid \ncorrection can cause a life-threatening complication, the \nosmotic demydination syndrome (ODS, see Table 24-3}. \n3. The choice of therapy is guided by the severity of symptoms, \nnot simply the sodium concentration. \na. Regardless of symptom severity, hypotonic or isotonic \nsaline (normal saline, lactated Ringers) or oral hypotonic \nfluids are contraindicated because they may worsen the \nhyponatremia in patients who have elevated ADH levels. \nb. Severe symptoms: \n(1) 3% normal saline (hypertonic saline) is \nrecommended in patients with hyponatremia \n(s 125 mEq/L) and severe symptoms (confusion, \nseizures, coma). \n(2) An initial bolus of 100 mL (of3% normal saline} is \nrecommended. This may be repeated twice (every \n10 minutes) if necessary. Larger single doses may \nbe appropriate when there are signs of impending \nbrainstem herniation (coma, seizures, etc.). \n(3) The 2015 Consensus Guidelines also recommend \nadministering the first dose of 3% normal saline \nChronic hyponatnimla: (> 48 h duration)' \nTarget \nMaximum \n4-6 m Eq/l.Jday\" \ns 6-8 mEq/l.Jday\" \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntervention \n100 ml5 3% NaCl over 1 O min. \nMay repeat x 2 if neededG every 1 O minutes \nFor mild-moderate symptoms: 0.5-2 ml/kg/h \nDepends on etlology.

The goals are meant to minimize the risk of that complication. See Table 24-3. \n'Once goal met for that 24-hour period, IV therapy should be stopped (as well as vaptans if used) and ongoing urinary water losses should be replaced with DSW or water by mouth. \nAlternatively, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) may be used to prevent further free water urinary losses (but may be ineffective in patients treated with vaptans). \n'2 mUkg in smaller patients. \n'Stop 3% normal saline If life-threatening symptoms abate. \n'Risk of ODS minimal if initial serum ~ 120 mEq/L and interventions to slorapid rates of correction are unnecessary. \nODS, osmotic demyelination syndrome. \n\nTable 24-3. Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). \n1. ODS Is a llfe-threatenfng compllcatlon of overly rapid correction of \nsevere chronic hyponatremia ( < 120 mEq/L for 2 or more days). \n2. Acute hyponatremia renders the serum sodium hypotonic relative \nto the astrocytes, causing water influx, astrocyte swelling, and \ncerebral edema. \n3. In chronic hyponatremia (> 48 hours), the astrocytes in the brain \nextrude osmols and lower their intracellular osmolality to match \nthe hypotonic serum. This adaptive response causes water efflux \nand decreases cerebral edema. \n4. Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremfa renders the serum \nhypertonic compared to hypotonic astrocytes, causing water \nefflux. damaging their cytoskeleton and DNA and potentially \ncausing cell death and demyelination. \ns. The major risk factor for ODS ls rapid correction of hyponatremla \nin patients with marked chronic hyponatremia (virtually always \ns 120, usually s 1 OS mEq/L). \n6.

Hayou \nruled out the active altematlvH1 Do other \nteete need to 1119 done to exclude alternative \ndiagnosH1 \nHYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA I 411 \nClearly the brother's history makes EAH, beer potomania, and \nEcstasy use unlikely. You wonder about the other causes of water \nintoxication, such as psychogenic polydipsia. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Psychogenic Polydipsia \nTextbook Presentation \nPsychogenic polydipsia typically occurs in patients with a psychiat-\nric history and unexplained hyponatremia. Patients are unaware of \n(or do not admit) to excessive water intake. Excessive water inges-\ntion and hyponatremia are also seen occasionally in patient who \ningest excess water for medical procedures. \nDisease Highlights \nA. In most other causes ofhyponatremia, ADH is elevated (either \nappropriately or inappropriately}, allowing water to be reab-\nsorbed from the distal tubule, which concentrates the urine. In \ncontradistinction, the increased water intake in psychogenic \npolydipsia suppresses ADH, increasing free water excretion \nand results in a dilute urine. \nB. Hyponatremia develops only when massive water ingestion \nis sufficient to overcome maximal urinary free water \nexcretion and then dilutes the serum sodium, which \nusually requires> 8-10 L/day fluid intake. (Less water \nintake can cause hyponatremia in patients with reduced \nkidney function who are unable to excrete large volumes \nof free water.) \nC. Therefore, urine osmolality is usually maximally dilute \n(= 40-100 mOsm/L) which is the key to diagnosis. \nD. Reported in 6-20% of chronically ill, hospitalized \npsychiatric patients. (SIADH may also be seen in \npsychiatric patients.) \nE. Other causes of voluntary water intoxication include college \nstudents (and others) drinking excessive water as a challenge \nand, rarely, patients who drink water far in excess of what has \nbeen medically recommended. \nF. Complications are secondary to both hyponatremia and \nmarked polyuria (incontinence, hypocalccrnia, hydronephrosis \n(from massive urinary output), and HF. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The water restriction test limits the patient's access to water. \nSince water excretion is normal, the patient excretes the excess \nwater promptly and hyponatremia resolves rapidly. However, \nthis must be done carefully in patients with marked hypona-\ntremia (Na S 120 mEq/L) to avoid over-rapid correct of \nhyponatremia and ODS. \nB. Urine osmolality \n1. Mean urine osmolality 144  23 mOsm/L vs 500 mOsm/L \nin SIADH and 539 mOsm/L in hypovolemic patients. \n2. Surprisingly, not all patients with psychogenic polydipsia \nhave a maximally dilute urine. Several problems can \naggravate the hyponatremia in psychogenic polydipsia and \ncomplicate the diagnosis. \na. Psychotic episodes may cause a transient release of ADH \nor an increased renal responsiveness to ADH. \nb. In addition, nausea or psychiatric medications can \ninduce concomitant SIADH (including selective \nserotonin reuptake inhibitors and phenothiazines). This \naccentuates the hyponatremia and can produce a higher \nthan expected urine osmolality. \n\n412 I CHAPTER 24 \nC. The urine sodium is often lo(despite euvolemia) due \nto the dilution of the sodium in the urine by the massive \nexcretion of water (mean 18 mEq/L). This can incorrectly \nsuggest hypovolemia. However, the fractional excretion of \nsodium (FE,_,_) is a more accurate measure of volume and \nsodium handling and is > 0.5% in 66% of patients. \nD. CNS tumors may trigger polydipsia and cause hyponatremia. \nCNS imaging is recommended before making the diagnosis \nof psychogenic polydipsia. \nTreatment \nA. For severe neurologic symptoms (eg, seizures, coma), \nhypenonic saline can be used. \nB. In other patients, careful free water restriction allows \ngradual restoration of serum sodium concentration. It \nis worth emphasizing that water restriction is far more \neffective for patients with water intoxication than for \nother causes of hyponatremia. Over-rapid correction \nputs patients at risk for ODS (Table 24-3) and must \nbe avoided. \nC. Table 24-2 summarizes the therapeutic approach to \nhyponatremia. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. Dis a 42-year-old man who is brought to the emergency \ndepartment by the police department. He Is disoriented \nand confused. Initial labs reveal a serum sodium concentra-\ntion of 118 mEq!L. \nAt this point, what le the leading hypotheele, \nwhat are the active alternatives, and le \nthere a must not mlH diagnosis? Given the \ndifflllrentlal diagnosis, what tests should be \nordsred7 \nMr. D's problems clearly include delirium and marked hypona-\ntremia. While other causes of delirium should be considered \n(see Chapter 11}, the hyponatremia clearly requires evaluation \nbecause it is severe and thus likely to be causing the delirium. \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \n& noted above the first step in evaluating patients with hypona-\ntremia is to revietheir history and laboratory findings to search \nfur highly specific results that suggest a particular diagnosis. This \nincludes the serum creatinine, glucose, potassium, urine, and \nserum osmolality (see Figure 24-1). \n\nDue to his confusion, Mr. D cannot give a medical history. \nHis chart is requested. Laboratory studies reveal a glucose \nof 100 mg/dl; K+. 3.8 mEq,IL; BUN, 28 mg/dl; creatinine, \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nAs Mr. P regains normal consciousness. he reports that \nhe sablood In his urine 2 days ago and began drinking as \nmuch water as possible ~ nons and ~ llons\" over the last \n36 hours to prevent a clot from forming In his bladder and \nblocking his urinat ion, (which he feared has happened, given \nhis lower abdominal pain). He denies drinking beer, using any \nrecreational drugs. and any recent endurance activities. \n~ \nle the cllnical information sufficient to make a \n1~1' diagnosis of water intoxication? If not, what \noth111r Information do you need? \nMr. P's history and lourine osmolality confirm the diagnosis of \nwater intoxication, in this case due to intentional massive water \ningestion. An indwelling urinary catheter is placed, allowing blad-\nder floand over the next 24 hours his spontaneous water diuresis \nraises his serum sodium to 137 mEq/L! However, since the cause \nof his hyponatremia was acute(< 48 hours), he was not at risk fur \nODS (see below). He is educated to limit his water intake. \n1.0 mg/dL; and a serum osmolallty of 252 mOsm/L. Urine \nosmolallty Is 480 mOsm/L. \nL, At thle point, le the laboratory Information \nlJI\" 5ufflclent to make a dlagnoel57 If not, what \nother Information do you nellld7 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. D's serum glucose and potassium are normal, ruling out \nhyponatremia from marked hyperglycemia, and decreasing the \nlikelihood of primary adrenal insufficiency. The urine osmolality \nis high enough to effectively rule out water intoxication (from \npsychogenic polydipsia, beer potomania, or Ecstasy use). The lo\nserum osmolality confirms true hypo-osmolar hyponatremia ruling \nout pseudohyponatremia. His serum creatinine is also normal rul-\ning out kidney failure. \n& often happens, the initial laboratories studies are not diagnos-\ntic. In cases such as this, the second key pivotal point is to ascertain \nwhether Mr. D is clinically hypervolemic, euvolemic, or hypovolemic \nin order to focus the differential diagnosis (Figure 24-2). \n\nPhysical exam reveals a disheveled man appearing \nolder than 4 2. He smells of alcohol. His vital signs are \nBP. 90/50 mm Hg; pulse, 90 bpm; temperature, 36.0\"C; \nRR. 18 breaths per minute. He has no orthostatlc changes. \nNeck veins are flat . His lungs are clear to auscu ltatlon. Car-\ndiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm. There ls no \nJVD, 53 gallop. or murmur. His abdomen is distended, and \nhis flanks are bulging. Extremity exam reveals 3 + pitting \nedema extending all the way up his thighs. \n\nAt thle point, what le the leading hyPOtheele, \nwhat are the active alttJmatlvee, ant.I le \nthere a must not miH diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnoeie, what tflete &hould be \nordered? \nMr. D's marked peripheral edema clearly indicates that he is \nhypervolemic. The final step in clinically hypervolemic patients \nexplores the differential diagnosis looking for risk factors, asso-\nciated symptoms and signs of possible diagnoses: HF, nephrotic \nsyndrome, cirrhosis, and kidney failure. Of these, cirrhosis seems \nmost likdy. The smell of alcohol raises the suspicion of alcohol \nabuse and liver disease, and the bulging flanks suggest ascites due \nto cirrhosis. HF is also possible, although Mr. D has neither an S3 \ngallop nor JVD. Nonethdess, HF should still be considered since \nneither finding is sensitive enough to rule out HF (and HF can also \ncause ascites). Kidney failure is effectively ruled out by his normal \ncreatinine. Nephrotic syndrome remains a possibility, since we do \nnot have any information yet about proteinuria or the serum albu-\nmin level. Table 24-4 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nRevieof Mr. D's past med!cal record reveals that he has \na lo~ history of alcohol-related complications. Six months \nS{:IO, he was hospitalized for bleeding esophageal varlces. \nThere is no history of thiazide use. \nTable 24-4.

Patients with cirrhosis \nmay have ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, jaundice, \nhypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, and elevated transaminases. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Hyponatremia is a marker of advanced cirrhosis found in 3% \nof patients with Child-Pugh class A, 16% in those with class B, \nand 31 % of those with class C. \nB. Hyponatremia is associated with a higher frequency of \nadverse outcomes (including hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic \nencephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and death), \nespecially if there is no clear precipitant of the hyponatremia. \nI. One study of hospitalized patients reported a 25% \nmortality among cirrhotic patients without hyponatremia \ncompared with 93% among those with hyponatremia. \nA study of outpatient cirrhotic patients reponed a 23% \n3-year mortality rate in patients without hyponatremia \nvs. 53% in those with hyponatremia. \n2. Funhermore, greater degrees of hyponatremia are \nassociated with an increasing risk of the hepatorenal \nsyndrome and hepatic encephalopathy (Table 24-5). \nC. Among patients with cirrhosis and ascites, 22% have sodium \n:S 130 mEq/L. \nD. Pathogenesis of hyponatremia in cirrhosis \nI. Decreased effective circulating volume (caused by \nhypoalbuminemia, splanchnic and syi;temic dilatation) \ndecreases mean arterial pressure, triggering the release \nof ADH which in turn causes water retention and \nhyponatrernia. Other intrarenal changes also contribute to \nthe hyponatremia. \n2. NSAIDs may decrease the GFR aggravating both edema \nand hyponatremia. NSAIDs also lower renal PGE2, which \nnormally antagonizes ADH. \nE. Hyponatremia may act synergistically with hyperammonemia \nto increase cerebral edema and encephalopathy. \nTable 24-5.

The \nrate of 85% was reported in patients hospitalized for an acute complication. \n\n414 I CHAPTER 24 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA. While several physical findings are specific for cirrhosis, \nnone are sufficiently sensitive to rule out cirrhosis in a \npatient (see Table 17-2). \nB. However, because hyponatremia develops in advanced \ncirrhosis, certain physical exam findings are common in \ncirrhotic patients with hyponatremia. \nI. Ascites present in 100% \nAscites is a very sensitive sign of cirrhosis in \nhyponatremic patients. Its absence effectively \nrules out cirrhosis in these patients. \n2. Peripheral edema seen in 59% \nC. Laboratory studies: \n1. Mean urine sodium 4 mEq/L (measurements made \nafter diuretics have been stopped for 5 days). (Decreased \neffective circulating volume causes increased renal \nreabsorption of sodium.) \n2. NT-proBNP. Patients with HF also occasionally have \nascites, which can erroneously suggest cirrhosis. One study \nin patients with ascites found that a serum NT-proBNP \ndistinguished HF from cirrhosis. 98% of patients with \ncirrhosis had levels< 1000 pg/mL whereas all HF patients \nhad levels over 1 OOO pg/ mL. (Patients with levds over \n1000 pg/mL could have both HF and cirrhosis.) \nTreatment \nA. Since the hyponatremia devdops gradually, severe symptoms \ndue to the hyponatremia are uncommon. Nonethdess, \npatients with severe neurologic symptoms (coma or seizures} \nand severe hypernatremia should be ueated emergently with \nhypenonic (3%} normal saline (Table 24-2). \nB. Similar to all patients with chronic hyponatremia, care must \nbe taken to ensure that treatment does not cause the serum \nsodium to rise too quickly. Rapid correction can cause \ncatastrophic neurologic damage due to ODS (Table 24-3). \nTable 24-2 lists the current guiddines for the recommended \nmaximum rate of increase in the serum sodium. \nC. Therapy has not been shown to improve survival and is not \nrecommended in asymptomatic patients with serum sodium \nlevds ~ 120 mEq/L. \nD. Fluid restriction is recommended panicularly in symptomatic \npatients and those with severe hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L). \nE. Vaptans (ADH receptor antagonists}: The FDA has recom-\nmended vaptans not be used in patients with cirrhosis. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nLab studies reveal an albumin of 2.1 g/dL, b!lirubin 6.2 mg/dL, \nAST 85 unlts/L, ALT 45 untts/L, iNR of 1.8. An abdominal \nultrasound reveals moderate ascites and a small liver wtth \ncoarse architecture suggestive of cirrhosis. \nHave you cro9&ed a diagnostic thre9holc:I \nfor tha Jaading hypothseie, clrrhoele1 Hava \nyou rulad out tha actlva alternatives? Do \nother taete need to be done to exclude the \nalternative diagnoses? \nMr. D's findings point fairly conclusivdy to hypervolemic hypona-\ntremia secondary to cirrhosis. The prior history of varices and \nascites point to portal hypenension while the jaundice, hypoalbu-\nminemia, and increased INR suggest synthetic failure by the liver. \nHF secondary to an alcoholic cardiomyopathy is still possible. \nOther causes of hypervolemia hyponatremia, such as nephrotic \nsyndrome, are less likely but possible. \nAlternative Diagnosis: HF Br Hyponatremia \nTextbook Presentation \nTypically, patients with HF complain of shortness of breath, dysp-\nnea on exenion, fatigue, and orthopnea. (See Chapter 15, Dyspnea \nfor a complete discussion of HF.) \nDisease Highlights \nA. Hyponatremia is observed in patients with severe HF and is \nassociated with an increased risk of death. \nB. Patients with HF and hyponatremia have marked increases in \ntotal body sodium causing volume overload and edema. \nC. In addition, free water clearance is also impaired. Water reten-\ntion exceeds sodium retention, causing the hyponatremia. \n1. Free water clearance is impaired in large part secondary to \ndevated ADH levels. This devdops when the locardiac \noutput triggers carotid baroreceptors that stimulate ADH \nrelease increasing water reabsorption in the collecting \nmbules and thereby hyponatremia. \n2. Other factors that contribute to the hyponatremia include a \ndecrease in the GFR (due to decreased renal perfusion) and \nan increase in proximal sodium reabsorption. (In order to \nexcrete free water, sodium must be delivered more distally, \nwhere it can be pumped out of the impermeable parts of \nthe tubule, leaving solute free water behind which can be \nexcreted.) \n3. If used, thiazides diuretics (but not usually loop diuretics} \ncan worsen the hyponatremia. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nSee HF discussion in Chapter 15, Dyspnea. \nTreatment \nA. Treatment of underlying HF \n1. Similar to other patients with HF (see Chapter 15, Dyspnea). \n2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \nL Can help restore sodium levels to normal. ACE \ninhibitors (and angiotensin receptor blockers) improve \ncardiac output, decrease ADH secretion, and facilitate \nfree water excretion. ACE inhibitors also directly \nantagonize the effect of ADH on the collecting tubules. \nb. Hyponatremic HF patients usually have activation of \nthe renin angiotensin system and are susceptible to ACE \ninhibitor-induced hypotension. Therefore, therapy with \nACE inhibitors should be initiated at lodoses. \n3. Loop diuretics can treat both the hypervolemia and \nhyponatremia. \n4. Avoid NSAID use, which can decrease prostaglandin-\ndependent renal blood floand worsen kidney function. \nB. Treatment of hyponatremia \n1. Patients with severe symptomatic hyponatremia (comas, \nseizures} should receive 3% normal saline (see Table 24-2). \nFurosemide should be given concurrently to prevent \nvolume overload. \n\nTable 24-6.

Loop diuretics as above \n3. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients \na. Restrict water intake < 1 OOO mU day and add \nfurosemide to volume overloaded patients to facilitate \nnatriuresis and augment free water loss. \nb. ADH receptor antagonists (vaptans) may be an option \nif free water restriction and furosemide arc inadequate \n(Table 24-6). However, hospitali:zation and careful \nmonitoring are required to ensure that the correction \nof scrum sodium is not too rapid. Therapy should \nbe limited to < 30 days and avoided in patients with \nliver disease. \nc. The rate of rise of serum sodium should be carefully \nmonitored. Recent recommendations guide the \ngoal and maximal rate of rise for the serum sodium \n(Table 24-2). Correction that exceeds these limits \nshould be countered with therapy to reduce the \nserum sodium (Table 24-3). \nd. Discontinue thiazide diuretics. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Nephrotic Syndrome \nTextbook Presentation \nSec Chapter 17, Edema for full discussion. Patients typically \ncomplain of edema. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Lesions may be primary and idiopathic (eg, minimal change \nlesion) or secondary to systemic disease (eg, diabetes mdlitus, \nmalignancy}. \nHYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA I 415 \nB. Glomerular lesions lead to albuminuria and \nhypoalbuminemia. \n1. Hypoalbuminemia decreases oncotic pressures decreasing \neffective circulating volume. \n2. Decreased effective circulating volume triggers sodium \nretention (which may be aggravated by kidney failure). \n3. The combination of sodium retention and \nhypoalbuminemia cause edema and hypervolemia. \n4. The ineffective circulating volume can also trigger \nADH release, reduce free water clearance, and promote \nhyponatremia. \n5. Pseudohyponatremia may also be seen secondary to marked \nhypertriglyceridemia. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Nephrotlc syndrome is characteri:zcd by urine protein \nexcretion~ 3.5 g/day, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and \nhyperlipidemia. \nB. Renal biopsy can hdp identify certain underlying disease \nstates. \nTreatment \nA. Free water restriction. \nB. Vaptans may be effective in patients with a GFR > 50 mU \nmin who do not respond adequately to water restriction \n(see Table 24-6). \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nAn echocardiO{Jram reveals normal left ventricular function \nand a urinalysis reveals only 1 + protelnuria, not SU!.JB5tlve \nof nephrotlc syndrome. A paracentesls ls performed to n.ile \nout 5P0ntaneous l:1acterlal peritonitis and Is normal. \nMr. D's history, physical exam, and laboratory findings clearly \npoint to severe cirrhosis. HF and nephrotic syndrome are effec-\ntively ruled out by the echocardiogram and urinalysis. The key \ntherapeutic decision is the rate at which to increase his serum \nsodium. Several features suggest great care should be given to avoid \novercorrection. First, he does not have severe neurologic symptoms \n(coma or seizures) that would mandate acute and rapid correction. \nSecond, the hyponatremia is likely chronic. Both the chronicity \nand his liver disease increase his risk for ODS, a potentially fatal \nneurologic complication that may develop when chronic hypona-\ntremia is corrected too rapidly (Table 24-3). An important aspect \nof his care is to ensure a safe and gradual return of his serum \nsodium to normal. \n\nMr. D's mild hyponatremla Is corrected slowly. He is begun \non free water restriction and his sodium gradually Improves \nto 128 mEqll. His mental status returns to normal. \n\n416 I CHAPTER 24 \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. Lis a 60-year-old woman who comes to see you with a \nchief complaint of weakness and fat19ue. Her past medical \nhistory Is remarkable only for hypertension that Is treated \nwith amlodlplne. Routine chemistries reveal a serum sodium \nof 123 mEq,/L. Her potassium and other electrolytes and \ncreatinine are normal. Her glucose is 108 mg/dL and BUN \nis 28 rtl{j/dL. Folloup labs reveal a serum osmolality is \n265 mOsm/L and urine osmolality of 4 70 mOsm/L. \nAt this point, what ie the leading hypotheeie, \nwhat are the active alternatlvee, and le \nthens a must not mles dlagnoels? Given this \ndifferential dlagnoeh!t, what teete ehould be \norc:lenui1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAgain, the first step in evaluating the patient with hyponatrernia \nis to . revieth_e history, physical exam, and initial lab findings \nfor highly specific clues that point to a particular diagnosis (ie, a \nhistory of thiazide use, recent marathon, marked hyperglycemia, \nunexplained hyperkalemia, a maximally dilute urine or normal \nsc:rum. osmolality) (see Figure 24-1). She is not taking a thiazide \ndiuretic, and her blood glucose and potassium are normal, ruling \no_ut mar_ked hyperglycemic hyponatremia and making the diagno-\n~IS of prim~ adrenal insufficiency less likely. Her urine osmolality \nIs normal rulmg out some form of water intoxication. Her serum \ncreatinine is normal (ruling out kidney failure) and her serum \nosmolality is low, confirming true hypo-osmolar hyponatrernia and \nruling out pseudohyponatrernia. The second key pivotal point is to \nclassify Mrs. L's clinical volume status as hypervolemic, euvolemic, \nor hypovolemic (see Figure 24-2). A careful exam should search \nfor signs of hypervolemia (edema, JVD, S gallop, crackles, or \nascites) or hypovolemia (hypotension, tachdia, or orthostatic \nhypotension). \nMrs. L denies any history that suggests volume loss \n(vomiting. dlarrhea, or excessive perspiration). She denies \nsymptoms suggestive of hypervolem ia such as edema. dys-\npnea on exertion, or orthopnea. Furthermore, she has no \nhistory of any ofthe diseases associated with hypervolemic \nstates (HF. cirrhosis. kidney disease. or nephrotlc syn-\ndrome). On physical exam, BP Is normal with no slgnlflcant \nchange going from lylng to standing. There Is no pretlblal \nor pedal edema. Cardiovascular exam reveals no JVD or S \ngallop. She has no crackles on lung exam. and there are ng \nsigns of ascites (bulging flanks. shifting dullness). \nMrs. L's history and exam suggest neither hypervolemia nor \nhypovolemia. Therefore, she is classified as clinically euvolemic. \nThe third key pivotal step reviews her urine sodium to distin-\nguish true euvolemia from subtle hypovolemia (see Figure 24-3). \n\nMrs. L's urine sodium concentration Is 60 mEq,JL. \nTable 24-7. Diagnostic hypotheses for Mrs. L. \nDiagnostic \nHypathess \nLeading Hypothesis \nDemographics, Risk \nFactors, Symptoms \nand Signs \nImportant \nTasts \n-------------------------------------------------\nSIADH \nHistory of cancer \n(or cancer risks) \nUnusual cough \nHemoptysis or \nlymphadenopathy \nNeurologlc or \npulmonary disease \nHIV \nUrine Na+ \n> 20-30 mEq/L \nUrine osmolality \nusually> 300 mOsm/L \nExclusion of \nhypothyroidism and \nadrenal Insufficiency \n-------------------------------------------------\nActive Alternative-Mast Cammon \n-------------------------------------------------\nHypothyroidism \nFatigue, cold \nintolerance \nTSH \n-------------------------------------------------\nActln Altematln-Must Nat Miu \n-------------------------------------------------\nAdrenal \ninsufficiency \nLong-term \ncorticosteroid therapy, \npituitary disease, HIV, \nsarcoldosls \nSerum cortisol, \ncorticotropin \nstimulation test \nSIADH, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating \nhormone. \nThe elevated urine sodium argues against hypovolemia and is \nconsistent with the clinical impression that Mrs. L is euvolemic. \nThe final step explores the differential diagnosis for euvolemic \nhyponatremia (see Figure 24-4). Causes include SIADH (most \ncommon), secondary adrenal insufficiency, and severe hypothyroid-\nism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] > 50 milli-international \nunits/mL). Although other disease states can cause euvolemic \nhyponatremia (such as the water intoxication states and thiazide \nuse), these are usually diagnosed initially by history or a lo\nurine osmolality. At this point the leading hypothesis is SIADH. \nTable 24-7 lists the differential diagnosis. Further history and labo-\nratory srudies may help rank the differential diagnosis. \n\nPast medical history: As noted above, she has hyperten-\nsion treated with amlodipine. Social history: 40-pack-\nyear history of smoking. Alcohol use Is minimal. Mrs. L \ndenies any drug use. Revieof systems is unremark-\nable.

Her normal TSH \nessentially rules out primary hypothyroidism. Her recent cough \nand tobacco history raise the possibility of SIADH from a lung \ncancer. Adrenal insufficiency is a potentially life-threatening cause \nof hyponatremia and should be considered a \"must not miss\" \ndiagnosis. \nle the clinical Information sufficient to make a \ndiagnoele7 If not, what other Information do \nyouneet.11 \n\nLeading Hypothesis: SIADH \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients are often elderly, with a chief complaint of falls, weakness, \nor confusion. Alternatively, mild hyponatremia may be discovered \nincidentally on serum chemistries. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Most common cause of hyponatremia \nB. Secondary to inappropriate ADH release despite hypotonicity \nand euvolemia. \nC. Despite water retention, patients appear clinically euvolemic. \nSubtle increase in volume leads to urinary sodium loss. \nD. Etiologies: A large variety of diseases may cause SIADH including \n1. Neurologic disease, 9-26%: eg, subarachnoid hemorrhage, \nstroke, meningitis, tumors, or trauma \n2. Intrathoracic disease, 11-19%: eg, pneumonia, \ntuberculosis, acute respiratory failure \n3. Cancer, 18-25%: Ectopic production of ADH by small \ncell carcinoma of the lung is the most common malignancy \ncausing SIADH but many other cancers can cause SIADH. \n4, Postoperative, 7-11 % \n5. Drugs, 8--18%: Carbamazepine (20--30% of patients}, \noxcarbazepine, Ecstasy, ADH analogs (vasopressin, DDAVP, \noxyrocin [5% of patients]), chlorpropamide, NSAIDs, \nantidepressants (tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake \ninhibitors), antipsychotics, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, \nnicotine, opioids, clofibrate, and many other medications \n6. AIDS \na. SIADH may be secondary to a variety of AIDS \ncomplications including Pneumocystis pneumonia, CNS \ninfections, or cancer. \nb. Hyponatremia may also develop secondary to HN-related \nadrenal insufficiency or diarrhea (with fu:e water ingestion}. \n.... --..... Evaluate patients with HIV and hyponatremia \ny \nfor adrenal insufficiency. \n7. Temporal arteritis \n8. Idiopathic \nE. Reset osmostat \n1. A variant of SIADH in which ADH control is modulated \nto maintain serum sodium levels but at a lower range than \nnormal. Patients retain their ability to excrete water load at \nthat neequilibrium point. \n2. Therefore, hyponatremia is not progressive. \n3. Patients typically have serum sodium levels between \n125 mEq/L and 135 mEq/L. \n4, Very dilute urine osmolality may be seen following water \nload {< 100 mOsm/L}. \n5. Etiology is similar to SIADH. \n6. Treatment is directed at the underlying disorder. \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Standard criteria \n1. Effective serum osmolality is low(< 275 mOsm/L). This \ncan be calculated using the following equation: Effective \nosmolality = (2 x Na)+ (Glucose/18). \nHYPONATREMIAAND HYPERNATREMIA I 417 \n2. Urine sodium is typically > 30 mEq/L in patients with \na normal dietary intake of sodium. (Since patients are \ntypically euvolemic, there is no stimulus to avidly reabsorb \nsodium and it is excreted.) However, patients with a lo\ndietary intake of sodium (13-42% of patients} may have \na lourine sodium and loF~.-\n3. Urine osmolality is inappropriately not maximally dilute. \nUrine osmolality > 100 mOsm/L and usually> 300 mOsm/L \n(ADH leads to water reabsorption in the tubules, \nconcentrating the urine.} \n4. Patients are not using diuretics. \n5. Patients are clinically euvolemic. \n6. Other causes of euvolemic hyponatremia must be excluded \n(hypothyroidism, psychogenic polydipsia, secondary \nadrenal insufficiency). \na. Secondary adrenal insufficiency can cause euvolemic \nhyponatremia and mimic SIADH. \nb. Despite recommendations to rule out adrenal \ninsufficiency in patients with suspected SIADH, only \n33-41 % of patients are appropriately evaluated for \nadrenal insufficiency. \nc. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed in 3-4% \nof patients in whom SIADH is initially suspected. \n(In 59% of patients, the secondary adrenal insufficiency \nwas due to exogenous steroid use.} \nTreatment \nA. Determine and treat underlying etiology. \n1. Reviemedications. Discontinue any medications that \nmay cause SIADH. \n2. Consider CT scan of the chest and head. \n3. SIADH often resolves with treatment of the underlying \ndisorder (eg, cancer, infection}. When due to cancer, \nrecurrent SIADH suggests cancer recurrence. \nB. It is important to note that isotonic saline without furosemide \nmay worsm hyponatremia because ADH promotes water \nretention while the sodium is excreted. \n....--...... Normal saline may worsm hyponatremia in \ny \npatients with SIADH. \nC. Therapeutic options include fluid restriction< 800 mUday, \nsalt tablets, furosemide with salt tablets, hypertonic 3% saline, \nand ADH receptor antagonists. \n1. Fluid restriction< 800 mUday is often used (except in \npatients with subarachnoid hemorrhage). Of note, fluid \nrestriction is unlikely to be successful as the sole measure if \nurine osmolality is > 500 mOsm/L. \n2. Salt tablets can increase urine osmolality and facilitate \nincreased water loss. \n3. Furosernide may be a useful adjunct to salt supplementation \nbecause it decreases the concentration of solute in the renal \nmedulla (which creates the osmotic driving force for water \nretention}, and thereby facilitates water excretion. \n4. Hypertonic saline (3%) augments water elimination and is \neffective. \na. Recommended for patients with severe neurologic \nsymptoms (coma, seizures; Table 24-2) \nb. May also be useful for patients with severe hypona-\ntremia who have less severe neurologic symptoms \n\n418 I CHAPTER 24 \n(confusion, lethargy), but care must be used not to \nexceed recommended rates of correction (Table 24-2) \nin order to avoid subsequent ODS (Table 24-3). \n(1) Frequent sodium monitoring is critical to guide \ntherapy. Although a large number of calculations \nhave been used to predict the response to therapy \n(normal saline or 3% normal saline), the kidney's \nresponse to therapy renders these frequently, and \noccasionally dangerously, inaccurate. \n(2) Hypertonic saline may be used with or without \nfurosemide. \n5. ADH receptor antagonists (vaptans) can be used but caused \nrapid and dangerous increases in the serum sodium in \n27% of patients with baseline sodium < 120 mEq/L. If used, \npatients require careful monitoring (see Tables 24-2, 24-3). \n6. Demeclocycline diminishes renal sensitivity to AD H but may \ncause nephrotoxicity and photosensitivity and is rarely used. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nAs noted above, Mrs. L is clinically euvolemic with a serum \nosmolality of 265 mOsm/L. urine osmolality of 4 70 mOsm/L, \nand urine Na+ of60 mEqlL. \nHav8 you crotHWJd a dlagnoetlc threshold \nfor th8 IHdlng hypoth8sls, 51ADH1 Hav\" \nyou rul8d out th8 oth8r active altematlv1Se \nthat cause euvolemlc hyponatremla1 Do \nother teete need to be done to e>CClude the \nalternativ\" diagnoe,,e1 \nMrs. L's fulfills virtually all of the diagnostic criteria for SIADH. \nShe is hypo-osmolar, clinically euvolemic, confirmed by her ele-\nvated urine sodium, with an elevated urine osmolality and has a \nnormal TSH (ruling out severe hypothyroidism as an alternative \ncause). The only remaining criteria is to exclude adrenal insuffi-\nciency, which as noted previously, is potentially life-threatening \ndisease that can mimic SIADH. If SIADH is confirmed, a search \nfor the underlying cause is appropriate. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Adrenal Insufficiency \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients may have chronic symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, nau-\nsea, vomiting, orthostasis, and abdominal pain or acute symptoms, \nsuch as a clinical constellation that suggests septic shock (hypoten-\nsion and fever). Adrenal insufficiency may also cause hypoglyce-\nmia. Both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency may cause \nhyponatremia. \nDisease Higb.ligbu \nA. Pathophysiology \n1. Adrenal insufficiency may be primary or secondary. \na. Primary adrenal insufficiency occurs when damage \nto the adrenal gland results in inadequate cortisol \nproduction. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) \nincreases because the hypothalamic pituitary axis \nattempts to compensate for the hypocortisolism. \nb. Secondary adrenal insufficiency develops when \ndamage to the hypothalamic pituitary system results in \ninadequate corticotropin (ACTH) production resulting \nin inadequate adrenal stimulation and hypocortisolism. \n2. In both cases (primary and secondary adrenal \ninsufficiency), cortisol levels are low. Cortisol normally \nsuppresses ADH release. Decreased cortisol causes increased \nADH levds and promotes hyponatremia. \n3. Primary adrenal insufficiency \na. The destruction of the adrenal gland often results in \ndecreased synthesis of other adrenal hormones as well \nas cortisol. Aldosterone, DHEA, and catecholamine \nsynthesis may be impaired. \n(1) Aldosterone deficiency results in salt losses and \nclinical hypovolemia. The hypovolemia may further \nstimulate ADH release. Finally, the aldosterone \ndeficiency may also cause hyperkalemia. \n~ \nSuspect primary adrenal insufficiency in \ny \nhyponatremic patients with hyperkalemia. \n(2) DHEA deficiency affects women but not men \n{due to the presence of more potent testicular \nandrogens). Findings may include decreased libido, \ndecreased axillary and pubic hair, and amenorrhea. \n(3) Catecholamine synthesis is also usually impaired \n{except in autoimmune adrenal disease). \nb. When secondary to autoimmune destruction \n(see bdow) may also be associated with other \nautoimmune diseases: hypothyroidism (47%), type \n1 diabetes (12%), vitamin B12 deficiency {10%), and \npremature ovarian failure (6.6% of women) \n4. Secondary adrenal insufficiency (hypothalamic-pituitary \ninsufficiency) \na. Decreased ACTH results in decreased cortisol levels, \nincreasing ADH and causing hyponatremia. \nb. Hyponatremia may be precipitated by inter-current \nillness, leading to inadequate cortisol response; 43% \nof patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency \nhad superimposed infection when presenting with \nhyponatremia. \nc. May be associated with deficiencies of other \npituitary honnones (ie, luteinizing hormone [LH], \nTSH) resulting in concomitant hypogonadism or \nhypothyroidism. \nd. Unlike primary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal gland \nis not destroyed in secondary adrenal insufficiency. \nSince aldosterone secretion is primarily under control \nof the renin angiotensin system, it remains unaffected. \nTherefore, patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency \nare euvolemic and do not develop hyperkalemia. \nB. Etiology \n1. Etiologies of primary adrenal insufficiency \na. Autoimmune adrenalitis (80-90% of cases in developed \nnations) \nb. HN infection: Up to 20% of patients with HIV have \nadrenal insufficiency. \nc. Tuberculosis {most common cause in developing nations) \nd. Less common etiologies: Fungal or cytomegalovirus \ninfections, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (seen in septic \nshock, patients taking anticoagulants, meningococcemia, \npostoperative patients, and the anticardiolipin antibody \nsyndrome), infiltration (cancer), inherited disorders \n\nand certain drugs (ketoconazole, rifampin, phenytoin, \ncarbamazepine, St. John's wort, and others) \n2. Etiologies of secondary adrenal insufficiency \n(hypothalamic-pituitary insufficiency) \na. Iatrogenic due to corticosteroid therapy \n(1) Adrenal insufficiency may devdop in up to 50% of \npatients taking long-term low-dose corticosteroid \ntherapy (oral> 5 mg/day prednisone for> 3 months, \ninhaled, topical, or intra-articular). \n(2) Recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis \nmay take 9-12 months. \nb. Sepsis \nc. Pituitary tumors (30% of patients with a pituitary \nmacroadenoma exhibit adrenal insufficiency) \nd. Less common etiologies: Pituitary infarction, traumatic \nbrain injury, irradiation, autoimmune hypophysitis, \nHIY, sarcoidosis, hemorrhage, hemochromatosis, empty \nsella syndrome \nSuspect hypopituitarism as the cause of \nhyponatremia in any patient with a history \nof pituitary disease (eg, macroadenoma, \ninfarction, empty sdla syndrome). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam \n1. Acute adrenal insufficiency {adrenal crisis): \na. Often presents similarly to septic shock with \nhypotension (90%), unexplained fever (66%), \nabdominal pain (with rigidity or rebound in 22%), \nvomiting (47%), and confusion (42%). Patients may \nalso have unexplained hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, \nand hyperkalemia. \nb. Occurs in 8% of patients with adrenal insufficiency \nper year; 6% of episodes fatal \nc. Often precipitated by inter-current stress (infection, \nemotional stress, surgery, pain, and many others) \nd. May be the initial manifestation of adrenal insufficiency \ne. Adrenal crisis may occur despite increase in \nglucocorticoids with stress. \nf. Occurs in patients with either primary or secondary \nadrenal insufficiency \n2. Chronic adrenal insufficiency \na. May present with a variety of nonspecific symptoms \n(eg, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, abdominal \ndiscomfort, musculoskeletal pains) \nb. Hypotension can be seen in both primary and secondary \nadrenal insufficiency due to the loss of vascular tone \nassociated with hypocortisolism. It is more common in \nprimary adrenal insufficiency (90%) due to concomitant \naldosterone deficiency. \nc. Hyperpigmentation is seen only in primary adrenal \ninsufficiency. \n(1) Underproduction of adrenal cortisol causes \na compensatory increase in the rdease of \nproopiomdanocortin (POMC), the precursor \nhormone that contains both ACTH and \nmelanocyte-stimulating hormone. \n(2) Typically develops in exposed areas such as the \nface, dorsum of hands, and knuckles, as well as \nHYPONATREMIAAND HYPERNATREMIA I 419 \nthe palmer creases of interphalangeal joints and \nareola of breast. There may also be a blue-black \nhyperpigmentation of the buccal mucosa. Patients \noften appear \"tanned.\" \n(3) Older reports suggest hyperpigmentation was \ninvariable in primary adrenal insufficiency. A more \nrecent report found hyperpigmentatlon in only \n18% of such patients. \nd. Other findings in chronic adrenal insufficiency \n(1) Weakness, tiredness, fatigue: 100% \n(2) Weight loss and anorexia: 100% \n(3) Musculoskdetal complaints 94% \n(4) Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea and vomiting \n86-75%, diarrhea 16% \n(5) Amenorrhea: 25% of women \n(6) Postural dizziness: 12% \n(7) Psychiatric manifestations (memory impairment, \ndelirium, depression, and psychosis): 5-50% \n(8) Vitillgo: 10-20% (another autoimmune \nphenomenon) \n(9) Salt craving: 16% \n(10) Visual fidd defects may occur in secondary adrenal \ninsufficiency when pituitary tumors compress the \noptic tracts. \n(11) Women may lose pubic and axillary hair in primary \nadrenal insufficiency due to the lack of adrenal \nandrogens. \nB. Laboratory tests (Figure 24-5) \n1. Guidelines suggest corticotropin stimulation testing (CST) \nin all cases of suspected adrenal insufficiency. However, in \nmany patients, adrenal insufficiency can be ruled in or out \nwith just a morning cortisol measurement, omitting the \nneed for the more complex CST. \n2. Morning cortisol levels \na. Cortisol secretion demonstrates a marked diurnal \nvariation. \nb. Early morning cortisol levels can help establish or refute \nadrenal insufficiency. \n(1) Morning levels~ 16.3 mcg/dL rule out adrenal \ninsufficiency (99.2% sensitive). \n(2) Morning levels s 3.6 mcg/dL establish adrenal \ninsufficiency (98.4% specific). \n(a) In such patients, 8 AM ACTH measurements \ndifferentiate primary from secondary adrenal \ninsufficiency. \n(b) ACTH is devated in primary adrenal \ninsufficiency. \n(c) ACTH is loin adrenal insufficiency secondary \nto hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. \n(3) Morning levds between 3.6 mcg/dL and 16.3 mcg/dL \nare nondiagnostic and necessitate CST. \n3. Corticotropin stimulation testing (CST) \na. Useful in patients with indeterminate morning cortisol \nlevels. (3.6-16.3 mcg/dL). \nb.

In such patients, exogenous ACTH will still \nstimulate the adrenal gland and cause an \nappropriate bump in cortisol. Thus, such \npatients can have a normal cortisol response \nin spite of disease {false-negative). \nii. Such patients require tests that challenge the \nentire hypothalamic-piruirary axis, such as \nthe insulin tolerance test. \niii. This is a complex test that requires \nexperience to avoid complications of \nhypoglyccmia. Endocrine consultation is \nadvised. \n4. Evaluation of adrenal insufficiency in acutely ill patients in \nthe ICU is complex. \na. Severe stressors often increase cortisol levels so that CST \nis often unnecessary. \nb. However, locortisol levels must be interpreted with \ncaution. Sick ICU patients often have lolevels of \ncortisol binding globulin (CBG). Patients with lo\nCBG may have lototal cortisol levels but may in \nfact have normal levels of free cortisol and may not \nhave adrenal insufficiency. Endocrine consultation \nis advised. \n5. Evaluation of confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency \na. A search for the underlying ctiology should include \na careful revieof medications, adrenal imaging \nwith CT scanning, and quantiferon gold, HIV, and \nantibodies to 21-hydroxylase (to look for autoimmune \nadrcnalitis). \nb. Patients with autoimmune adrenal insufficiency \nshould be evaluated for other commonly associated \nautoimmune diseases (hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes, \nvitamin B12 deficiency, and premature ovarian failure). \nc. Plasma aldostcrone and plasma renin activity (PRA) \nshould be measwed to determine whether the patient \nis also mineralocorticoid deficient (elevated PRA with \nnormal to loaldostcronc is suggestive of deficiency). \n6. Evaluation of confirmed secondary adrenal insufficiency \na. A pituirary MRI should be performed to look for \ntumors or infarction. \nb. Patients should be evaluated fur the loss of other \npituitary hormones. \n7. Serum electrolytes arc abnormal in many but not all \npatients with adrenal insufficiency. \na. Hyponatremia develops in 88% of patients with \nprimary or secondary adrenal insufficiency (secondary \nto hypocortisolism increasing ADH release). \nHYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA I 421 \nb. Hyperkalemia develops in 50% of patients with primary \nadrenal insufficiency due to aldostcrone deficiency. It is \nnot seen in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency \n{ba;ause aldostcrone secretion is normal). \nc. Hypercalcemia may be seen but is uncommon. \n8. Urine electrolytes in hyponatrcmic patients with adrenal \ninsufficiency: Decreased conisol secretion results in \nincreased ADH levels and thereby results in laboratory \nvalues similar to SIADH (average urinary sodium, \n110 mmol/L; average urine osmolality, 399 mOsm/L). \n9. Eosinophilia has been reported in 17% of patients. \n10. Hypoglyccmia is rare in adults. \nTreatment \nA. Long-term therapy \n1. In both primary and secondary insufficiency, therapy \nmust replace normal corticosteroid output and the dosage \nmust be automatically increased at times of stress to prevent \nlift-threatening adrenal crisis. \n2. Glucocorticoid \nL \nDaily dose: 15-25 mg hydrocortisonc per day divided \ntwo or three rimes daily with highest dose in the morning. \nb. Prevention of adrenal crisis: Dosage should be \nincreased for many stressors including strenuous \nphysical activity, febrile illnesses, surgery, pregnancy, \netc. In addition, patients should have available \ninjectable hydrocortisonc should they be unable to \ntake oral medications and have a medic alert bracelet. \nConsultation is advised. \n3. Mincralocorticoid (in patients with primary adrenal \ninsufficiency) \na. Confirm deficiency by checking plasma renin activity \nand aldosterone levels. \nb. If aldosterone deficient, ucat with 50-100 mcg/day of \nfludrocortisone \nc. Monitor potassium levels as well as BP \n4. DHEA (50 mg/day) can be considered fur women with \nprimary adrenal insufficiency and an impaired sense of \nwell being or decreased libido despite glucocorticoid and \nmineralocorticoid replacement. \nB. Treatment of adrenal crisis \n1. Hydrocortisonc 100 mg IV and then 50 mg IV every \n6 hows for patients with confirmed or suspected adrenal \ncrisis. Therapy should not be delayed fur the results of \ndiagnostic tests. \n2. Normal saline (often up to 1 Uh) \nWhen adrenal crisis is suspected, blood tests \nshould be drawn for cortisol and ACTH. \nTreatment should commence immediately and \nnot await laboratory results. \n3. Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that ovcr-\nrapid correction ofhyponatrcmia docs not develop with \nsteroid therapy (Table 24-2). Both glucocorticoids and \nfluid resuscitation suppresses ADH, promotes a water \ndiuresis, and may result in overcorrection. \n4. Patients with fever should be evaluated fur infectious \netiologies and treated appropriately. It should 1Wt be \nassumed that fever is secondary to adrenal insufficiency. \n5. Endocrinology consultation is advised. \n\n422 I CHAPTER 24 \nC.

Patients may be \nasymptomatic or complain of weabe.ss, lethargy, or occasionally \nconfusion due to hyponatremia. \nDiseuc Highlights \nA. One of the most common c:awcs of hyponattemia \nB. Oficn ~tcd with more severe hyponaucmia than frequently \nseen in other etiologies (mean scrum sodium, 116 mEq/L) \nC. Most commonly seen with thiazid.e diuretics; rarely seen with \nloop diuretics \nD. More common in patients over 70 years (OR 3.9), and \npatients with a lobody mass indcr.: \nE. 56-70% of patients are women \nF. Hyponatremia can be multifactorial; pathogenesis may vary in \ndifferent patients. \nG. Usually develops within 2 weeks of initiation but may occur \nlater if other risk factors for hyponatremia devdop \nH. Pathophysiology \n1. Thiazid.e diuretics inte.rfen: with NaCl transport in cortical \ndiluting segments, causing natriure&is and interfering with \nthe generation of free water within the tubule. This limits \nfree water excretion. \n.2. The nattiuresis mults in hypovolemia. \n3. Hypovolcmia may increase ADH levels, and interfere with \nfree water clearance. \n4. Hypovolemia also reduces the GFR, which increases \npro:Wnal sodiwn reabsorption, leading to reduced distal \nsodium delivery and reduced free water clearance. \nS. In some patients, hyponatremia devdops due to a \ncombination of increased water intake coupled with \nADH independent water retention. Such patients appear \nclinic:ally euvolernic. \nL NSAID use may increase the risk of thiazide-induced \nhyponatremia. \n]. Hyporuatremia may persist for 1 month after discontinuation \nof th.iazide. \nEvidenc:e-Bued Diagnotia \nA. The diagnosis is based on history of thiazide use. \nB. Clinical dehydration is evident in only 24% of patients. \nC. Symptoms include lethargy 49%, dizziness 47%, vomiting \n35%, confusion 17%, and seizW'CS 0.9%. \nD. Despite volume depletion, urine sodium concentration may \nbe elevated if diurctic action is still present. \nTreatment \nA. Electrolytes should be check shortly after initiating thiazide \ndiuretics. \nB. Symptomatic hyponattemia: Sec Table 24-2 \nC. Asymptomatic hyponatrcmia: Stopping the diuretic is usually \nadequate. Thiazides should not be reinitiated later. Rapid and \ndangerous hyponatretnia often recun. \nD. Hypovolemic patients \n1. Consider azrefUl volume resuscitation with normal saline. \n2. Unlike euvolemic or hypervolemic patients, fluid \nresuscitation in a hypovolemic patient restores volume \nand thereby suppn:sscs .ADH. The fall in ADH may result \nin rapid water l05ses and an overly rapid and dangerous \ncorrection of the serum sodium concentration resulting \nin ODS (Table 24-3). Serum sodium levels should be \nmonitored closely and electrolyte replacement may \n\nneed to be terminated (and free water administered) \nif serum sodium levds or urinary output rise abruptly \n(see Table 24-2). \nHypothyroidism \nHypothyroidism is reviewed in detail in Chapter 18, Fatigue. This \nsection will focus on hyponatremia in hypothyroidism. \nA. Hyponatremia may occur in 10% of patients with hypothy-\nroidism but is rardy symptomatic. \nB. Hyponatremia arises in part secondary to ADH rdease \ntriggered by a decrease in cardiac output. \nC. Hyponatremia typically develops only in severe hypothyroid-\nism (TSH > 50 milli-international units/ml). Patients with \nmild hypothyroidism and hyponatremia should be evaluated \nfor other causes. \nHypovolemic Hyponatremic Syndromes \nTextbook Presentation \nHyponatremia may develop in volume-depleted patients if sodium \nlosses {resulting from vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive perspira-\ntion) are sufficient to trigger ADH rdease and are replaced with \nfree water. Patients may have orthostatic hypotension or dry \nmucous membranes. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The primary controller of ADH rdease is serum osmolality. \nHypo-osmolality normally inhibits ADH release leading to \nfree water diuresis. \nB. Significant hypovolemia can stlmulate ADH release indepen-\ndent of serum osmolality. \nC. Free water ingestion in face of elevated ADH levds causes \nhyponatremia. \nD. Typical urine findings include \n1. Decreased urine sodium concentration (< 30 mEq/L) \n2. Decreased F~. (< 0.5%) \n3. Increased urine osmolality (> 450 mOsm/L) \n4. Prerenal azotemia (BUN/Cr > 20) \n5. Elevated uric acid \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The clinical exam has limited sensitivity for hypovolemia in \nhyponatremic patients. \nB. Spot urine sodium \n1. Since hypovolemia promotes avid sodium reabsorption, \nhypovolemia is usually associated with a lourinary sodium \nconcentration(< 20-30 mEq/L) and loF~ \n.. (< 0.5%). \nOn the other hand, euvolemic patients do not have a \nstimulus to reabsorb urine sodium and usually have a \nhigher urinary sodium (> 20-30 mEq/L) and F~ \n- . \n2. Average urinary sodium in hypovolemic patients: \n18.4 mEq/L, compared with 72 mEq/L in euvolemic patients \n3. Urine Na < 30 mEq/L: 63-80% sensitive for hypovolemia, \n72-100% specific, LR+ 2.2-oo, LR-0.2-0.5 \n4. F~ \n-  may be more sensitive. \na. F~ \n-  = (UN .. x p c)l(P Na+ x Uc) \nb. Compares fraction of sodium excreted to fraction of \nsodium filtered. In hypovolemic states, the fraction \nexcreted should be low(< 0.5%). \nHYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA I 423 \nc. One study reported F~ < 0.5% 100% sensitive for \nhypovolemia, 72% specii\\c, LR+ 3.5, LR- 0 \n5. False-negative results (elevated urine sodium or F~ \n-  \nin hypovolemic patients) may be seen in hypovolemia \nsecondary to: \na. Diuretics \nb. Primary adrenal insufficiency in which the \nhypoaldosteronism impairs urinary sodium reabsorption \nand leads to sodium wasting. \nc. Vomiting with accompanying metabolic alkalosis. The \nmetabolic alkalosis causes an obligatory urinary HCQ3-\nloss, which is accompanied by sodium. Urine chloride \nmay be loand diagnostic in such cases. \n6. False-positive results (lourine sodium in euvolemic \npatients) may be seen in certain euvolemic patients. \na. Psychogenic polydipsia. These patients are euvolemic \nbut usually have lourine sodium concentration due to \ndilution of the excreted sodium in vast quantities of water. \nb. Some patients with SIADH ingest little sodium causing \ndecreased urinary sodium output. \nTreatment \nA. For mildly symptomatic patients, normal saline can be used. \nB. For severely symptomatic patients with coma or seizures, 3% \nnormal saline can be used {Table 24-2). \nC. These patients are at particularly high risk for ODS \n{Table 24-3) because fluid resuscitation will suppress ADH, \npromote a water diuresis, and cause: the: serum sodium to rise \nfaster than formulas predict. \nD. Frequent monitoring of serum sodium is mandatory and \na lowering of the serum sodium may be necessary if the \ncorrection rate exceeds recommended limits {Table 24-2). \nHyponatremia with Normal or Hyper-\nosmolality & Pseudohyponatremia \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with pseudohyponatremia typically present in 1 of 3 ways, \ndepending on the underlying cause. Patients with pseudohypona-\ntremia due to marked hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, are \nusually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally due to laboratory \ntesting. On the other hand, marked hyperglycemia may also cause \nhyponatremia and these patients usually present with symptoms of \ntheir severe hyperglycernia (polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and \ndehydration) as well as the underlying precipitant. Patients with \nkidney failure often present with edema and may have neurologic \nsigns caused by the uremia or hyponatremia or both. \nDisea5e Highlights \nA. Because sodium is the major extracellular osmol, hyponatremia \nis almost always associated with hypo-osmolality. \nB. Occasionally, hyponatremia occurs in patients with either a \nnormal or elevated serum osmolality. The conditions associated \nwith hyponatrernia and a normal or elevated serum osmolality \ninclude pseudohyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and uremia. \n1. Pseudohyponatremia \na. Marked hyperlipidemia and marked hyperproteinemia \nmay interfere with the accurate measurement of sodium \nand cause the sodium concentration to appear spuriously \nloand are therefore referred to as pseudohyponatrmzia. \nb. The actual serum sodium is normal. \n\n424 I CHAPTER 24 \nc. The measured serwn osmolality is normal. \nd. These conditions should be suspected in patients with \nhyponatremia but normal serum osmolality. \n2. Marked hyperglycemia \na. In poorly controlled diabetes, marked hyperglycemia \nacts as an osmotic agent and draws water into the \nextracellular space and thereby dilutes the sodiwn \ncausing true hyponatremia. In this situation, the \nhyperglycemia makes the serwn hyperosmolar. \nb. The devated serum osmolality stimulates ADH \nrelease (decreasing free water clearance) which further \naccentuates the hyponatremia. (Hypernatremia may \nalso occur if water intake is limited. See below.) \n3. Uremia: \na. Kidney failure often interferes with free water clearance, \ncausing water retention and true hyponatremia. \nb. However, the kidney failure also interferes with urea \nclearance and marked elevations in urea can occur \nincreasing both the measured and calculated serwn \nosmolality resulting in both true hyponatremia and an \nelevated or normal serwn osmolality. \nc. Unlike hyperglycemia, urea crosses cell membranes \nand does not drawater into the intravascular space. \nTherefore, urea itself is not the cause of hyponatremia in \nkidney failure but is rather due to water retention. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. True hyponatremia always lowers the serwn osmolality. \nHyponatremic patients with a normal or elevaud serwn \nosmolality have pseudohyponatremia. \nB. The serwn glucose, lipids, total protein, BUN, and creatinine \nshould be measured. \nC. The serwn sodium can be measured accurately by some point \nof care devices and blood gas analyzers. \nD. Marked hyperglycemia and an elevated serum osmolality \nsuggests pseudohyponatremia due to hyperglycemia. \n1. Correction factors can help determine whether the \nhyponatremia is solely due to the hyperglycemia or some \nother cause. The optimal correction factor is controversial. \n2. Experiments suggest that hyperglycemia decreases the \nactual serwn sodium concentration by 2.4 mEq/L for every \n100 mg/dL elevation in blood glucose. This allows clinicians to \nestimate the serwn sodium after the hyperglycemia is treated \nand the water relocates to the intracellular compartment. \n3. Corrected serum sodiwn = measured serum sodium + \n{2.4 *(glucose - 100)/100} \n4. For example, in a patient with a measured serwn sodiwn \nof 122 mEq/L and glucose of 1000 mg/dL, the estimated \ncorrected sodium followed treatment of the hyperglycemia \n= 122 + {2.4*(1000 - 100)/100) = 122 + 21.6 .. 144 \nTreatment \nTreatment is directed at the underlying disorder. \nMOMA (Ecstasy or Molly) Intoxication \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients are typically college students, attending clubs (raves), who \noften present on the weekend with anxiety, restlessness, delirium, \nor seizures. \nDisease Highlights \nA. MDMA is a synthetic illicit sympathomimetic amphetamine \nthat stimulates the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, and \nserotonin, and blocks their reuptake. \nB. Causes increased alertness, euphoria, sexual arousal, and \ndisinhibition \nC. Frequent drug of abuse {up to 4.4-10% of high school seniors \nand 39% of US college students have reponed use). Its use \nhas been reported in 60-76% of rave participants. Accounted \nfor 44% of patients requiring medical suppon at an electronic \ndance festival. \nD. Symptoms and signs among emergency department visits for \nMDMA use include agitation (38%), anxiety (29%), disorien-\ntation (25%), shaking (23%), hypertension (21 %), headache \n(19%), mood changes (19%), psychotic disturbances (17%), \nloss of consciousness (13%), tachycardia (10%), dilated pupils \n(10%), hyperthermia {6%). \nE. Serious complications have included hypoglycemia, hypona-\ntremia, hyperthermia, malignant hypertension, stroke, CNS \nhemorrhage, coma, seizures, myocardial infarction, arrhyth-\nmias, aortic dissection, nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis, acute \nkidney injury, hepatitis, liver failure, disseminated intravascu~ \nJar coagulation, and death (even in first time users). \nF. Commonly ingested with other drugs \nG. Hyponatremia \n1. Discovered in 6% of MOMA-related emergency \ndepartment visits. \n2. Hyponatremia may be severe and cause cerebral edema, \nseizures, coma, and death. The mortality in patients with \nMOMA-induced hyponatremia is 50%. \n3. Secondary to ADH secretion (SIADH) and water \nintoxication. The water intoxication is prompted by \nhyperthermia, diaphoresis, and increased thirst. It is funher \naggravated by \"recommendations\" to drink large amounts \nof water. \n4. Unlike other MDMA complications, women are more \nsusceptible to MOMA-induced hyponatremia than men. \n(85% of the case reports of MOMA-induced hyponatremia \nhave been in women.) \nS. Hyponatremia can occur after just a single dose. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. MDMA is excreted in the urine and can be detected by \nspecific tests. \nB. Nwnerous congeners ofMDMA exist. \nC. Urine studies may not detect various congeners and the \ndiagnosis is often made clinically. \nTreatment \nA. The treatment of MOMA intoxication is beyond the scope of \nthis text. Treatment will focus on the hyponatremia. \nB. ICU monitoring is usually required. \nC. For asymptomatic patients with mild hyponatremia, fluid \nrestriction is usually adequate. \nD. For marked symptoms (coma, seizures) hypertonic saline \nshould be used (see Table 24-2). The risk of ODS is minimal \nin patients with MDMA-induced hyponatremia because the \nhyponatremia is acute. \n\nHYPERNATREMIA \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. R 15 an 80-year-old nursing home re5ldent with a \nhl5tory of 5evere dementia. He ha5 been brought to the \nemergency department with lethargy and confusion. Serum \nchemistries reveal a sodium level of 168 mEq!L. \nAs noted in Chapter 1, the first task when evaluating patients is \nto identify their problem(s). Like hyponatremk patients, hyper-\nnatremic patients often suffer from an altered seruorium; hyper-\nnatremia is found on serum chemistries. In addition to evaluating \nother possible causes of confusion, the cause of the hypernatremia \nshould be determined and treatment initiated since the hyperna-\ntremia may be contributing to the delirium. \nWhat Is the differential diagnosis of \nhypernatremla1 Howould you frame the \ndifferential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nHypernatremia (defined as serum sodium> 145 mEq/L) is almost \nalways secondary to a free water deficit. The differential diagnosis \nof hypernatremia is markedly simpler than that of hyponatremia \nand usually develops in 1 of 3 situations: (1) impaired water intake, \n(2) hyperglycernic hyperosmolar state, or rarely (3) diabetes insipidus. \nHypernatremia and hyperosmolality are potent stimulators not \nonly of ADH, but also of thirst, which promotes drinking and \nprotects against hypernatremia. Therefore, hypernatremia occurs \nalmost exclusively in patients who are either unaware of their \nthirst or physically unable to get to water. The most common clin-\nical scenarios involve infants or debilitated elderly patients with \nsevere dementia. In such patients, normal insensible water losses \nor increased water loss (ie, from diarrhea) are not matched by oral \nintake and hypernatremia develops. Normal kidneys respond by \nmaximizing water reabsorption resulting in a high urine osmolality \n(> 600 mOsm/L). In over 50% of elderly patients, a superimposed \nprocess (ie, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or cerebrovascular \naccident) is present. The 30-day mortality in elderly hypernatremic \npatients has been reported at 41.5%. \nClinicians should search for an underlying \ncause in patients discovered to have \nhypernatremia. \nHypernatremia may also develop in patients with marked hyper-\nglycemia. The osmotic diuresis results in a free water loss and may \nresult in hypernatremia if free water intake is impaired due to an \naltered sensorium. The magnitude of the hypernatremia may not \nbe obvious on initial laboratory results because the hyperglycemia \ndraws water from the intracellular compartment into the extracel-\nlular compartment diluting the sodium concentration. With treat-\nment of the hyperglycemia, water moves back to the intracellular \nspace and the hypernatremia worsens. (See Chapter 12, Diabetes.) \nOther causes of hypernatremia are rare and will be touched \nupon here only briefly. Hypernatremia may develop in patients with \nimpaired renal water conservation (ie, diabetes insipidus). Even in \nthese patients, increased thirst normally prompts increased water \nintake and allows such patients to compensate and maintain normal \nHYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA I 425 \nserum sodium levels. (These patients complain of polydipsia and \npolyuria.) Hypernatremia may develop when a superimposed pro-\ncess limits water intake. The urine osmolality in such patients is \ninappropriately lo(< 600 mOsm/L). Diabetes insipidus can result \nfrom pituitary processes that decrease ADH production or renal \nprocesses, which cause resistance to ADH. Finally, very rare causes \nof hypernatremia include hypothalamic lesions, which render \npatients unaware of thirst despite a normal sensorium, or increased \nsalt intake (ie, infusion ofhypertonic saline or salt water ingestion). \nIn summary, the approach to hypernatremia focuses on a thor-\nough history and physical exam with particular emphasis on the \nassessment of vital signs, orthostasis, and dehydration. A urine \nosmolality, serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose \nare often adequate to determine the etiology. Figure 24-7 outlines \nthe approach to hypernatremia. \nDifferential Diagnosis of Hypernatremia \nA. Impaired water intake: urine osmolality > 600 mOsm/L \n1. Neurologic disease (eg, dementia, delirium, coma, stroke) \n2. Water unavailable (ie, desert conditions) \nB. Osmotic diuresis with impaired water intake \nI. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia \n2. Postobstructive diuresis \nC. Rare etiologies \n1. Diabetes insipidus (if associated with decreased water \nintake) \na. Neurogenic diabetes insipidus (decreasedADH \nproduction) \nb. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ADH resistance) \n(1) Long-term lithium ingestion \n(2) Hypercalcemia \n2. Hypothalamic lesions causing decreased thirst \n3. Increased salt intake \na. Salt water ingestion \nb. Hypertonic saline \nc. Isotonic saline replacement of hypotonic saline loss \n~ \n~ \nHoreliable le the hl9tory and ph)'!llcal exam \n,. for detecting hypematremla7 \nSigns and symptoms develop due to dehydration (tachycardia, \northostatic hypoteruion, dry mucous membranes and axilla) and \ndue to the hypernatremia (depressed sensorium, coma, focal dd1-\ncits, and seizures}. Hypernatremia-induced brain shrinkage can also \nresult in rupture of cerebral veins and subarachnoid hemorrhage. \nSymptoms are more severe when hypernatremia develops rapidly. \nThe clinical findings in patients with hypernatremia are summarized \nin Table 24-8. No finding was highly sensitive for hypernatremia. \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe patient's underlying dementia put him at increased risk for \nhypernatremia due to inadequate water intake, particularly if a \nsuperimposed illness has resulted in delirium. This is the leading \nhypothesis. Marked hyperglycemia should always be considered a \n\"must not miss\" alternative. Inadequate water conservation due to \ndiabetes insipidus is possible but far less common.

If not, what othsr information do \nyou nssd1 \nLeading Hypothesis: Hypernatremia \nSecondary to Inadequate Water Intake \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with hypernatremia due to inadequate water ingestion \nusually have an altered neurologic status or physical disability. A \nsuperimposed illness may worsen cognitive function, decrease oral \nintake, and promote hypernatremia. Mental status is almost alwa}'5 \nimpaired and may vary from confusion to frank coma. \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nThe diagnosis is easily confirmed by the presence ofhypernatremia, \nincreased urine osmolality, and absence of hyperglycemia. \nTreatment \nA. The brain adapts to hypernatremia by increasing intracellular \nosmolality to minimize cellular dehydration. \nB. Rapid correction of hypernatremia makes the serum hypo~ \ntonic relative to the brain. This promotes osmotic movement \nof water into the brain and cerebral edema. Seizures and \ndeath can occur if correction is too rapid, although this occurs \nalmost exclusively in children. \nHYPONATREMIA AND HYPERNATREMIA I 427 \nC. Hypernatremia should be corrected slowly= 0.4 mEq/L/h \n(s 10 mEq/Uday). \nD. A recommended approach includes the following: \nI. Normal saline to correct the patient's concomitant volume \ndeficit \na. Hypernatremic patients are usually markedly \nhypovolemic. If hypotensive, they may be 10% \ndehydrated (7L in a 70-kg man). \nb. Often patients will take several 1-liter boluses to improve \nBP, resolve orthostasis, and improve urinary output. \nc. Normal saline boluses commonly administered as \n500-1000 mL over 1 hour \nd. Patients should be reevaluated after each bolus. Vital \nsigns and orthostasis should be rechecked, and patients \nshould have a careful heart and lung exam to ensure \nthey are not receiving excessive fluid. Urinary output \nshould be monitored. \ne. Once BP and urinary output are restored, boluses can \nbe stopped and the remaining fluid deficit divided over \nthe next 48 hours. \n2. D5W @ 1.35 mUhour/kg should be administered to \nrestore the free water deficit and correct hyponatremia \nby < 10 mEq/Uday. \n3. Add ongoing free water losses, if any. \n4. Remeasure serum sodium frequently (every 4--6 hours) to \nensure rate is neither too excessive nor too slow. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr. R's urine osmolalit y is 850 mOsm/L. \nThe elevated urine osmolality confirms urinary concentrating \nability and establishes inadequate fluid intake (versus inadequate \nconservation) as the etiology. An evaluation of the underlying p~ \ncipitant is also important. \n\nA chest film reveals a right lower lobe pneumonia. Blood cul-\ntures groStreptococcus pneumoniae. \nAs in the overwhelming majority of cases of hypernatremia, the \ndiagnosis is straightforward. The history, exam, and elevated urine \nosmolality all confirm hypernatremia due to decreased intake. \nUrine concentrating ability is intact. Serum glucose is normal. The \ncause of his deterioration is evident (his pneumonia and bacter~ \nmia). Further diagnostic testing is not required. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. R Is given D5W. His body weight Is measured at 140 lbs \n(63 kg). The rate of free water administration must be \ndetermined. He is given piperacilli n-tazobacta m to treat his \naspiration pneumonia. \n(continued) \n\n428 I CHAPTER 24 \nThN3e days after D5W is started, his electrolytes are \nnormal. He gradually retums to his baseline neurologic func-\ntion and Is discharged after 6 days of theraPY to continue \nhis oral antibiotics at the nursing home. \nHyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State \nSec Chapter 12, Diabetes. \nREFERENCES \nAlmond CS, Shin AY, Fortcscue EB et al.

Shock is present if there is \nevidence of multisystem organ hypoperfusion. This may manifest \nitself as tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, poorly perfused skin \nand extremities, altered mental status, or decreased urinary output. \nIn addition, it is not necessary for a patient to have overt hypoten-\nsion to be in shock since a marked reduction in a patient's usual BP \nmay cause shock (but still be in the low-normal range in previously \nhypertensive patients). Given the life-threatening nature of shock, \nhemodynarnic stabilization must be prompt and cannot wait for a \nlong series of investigations to be completed. \nTherefore, a rational, rapid approach to hypotension is nec--\nessary. The 3 main etiologies of shock include distributift (lo\ntotal peripheral resistance, usually septic), audiogenic {locardiac \noutput despite adequate intravascular volume), and bypovolemic \n(locardiac output due to lointravascular volume). In terms of \nepidemiology, septic shock is by far and away the most common. \nIn a trial of over 1600 patients with shock, 62% had septic shock, \n16% had hypovolemic shock, and 16% had cardiogenic shock. \nDifferential Diagnosis of Shock \nA.

She complains of weak-\nness, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Her initial vital s~ns \ndemonstrate a pulse of 110 bpm and BP of 85/55 mm Hg. \nShe is having difficulty staying awake during the Interview. \n~\"' At this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \n1~r and what are the active altematlvH1 What \nother tests should be ordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe fuse step in approaching patlents with hypotension and shock \nis recognition. Is there evidence of decreased perfusion? This may \nbe manifest by any 1 or more of the following: \nA. Significantly decreased BP \n1. Typically systolic BP < 90 mm Hg \n2. A patient may be in shock with a \"normal\" BP; comparison \nto prior BPs is necessary. \n3. BP should be measured with a manual cuff. BPs measured \nwith automatic BP cuffs may be inaccurate at lower BPs, \nespecially the pulse pressure. \n4. The pulse pressure should be calculated: pulse pressure = \nsystolic BP - diastolic BP. Wide pulse pressures suggest \nhigh cardiac output, whereas narropulse pressures suggest \nlocardiac output (ie, septic shock vs cardiogenic shock). \nB. Tachycardia \nC. Increased respiratory rate \nD. Alteration of mental status \nE. Decreased urinary output \nF. Increased venous lactate \nThe first pivotal diagnostic step is to differentiate septic shock \nfrom cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock \nis often obvious due to a history of hemorrhage or dehydratlon \nand patients usually have a history of mdena, bright red blood \nper rectum, vomiting, diarrhea, or poor oral intake. In addition, \nit is typically associated with signs of locardiac output includ-\ning a narropulse pressure, cold extremities, and poor capillary \nrefill. Anemia or acute kidney injury may be evident on laboratory \nexam. Distributive shock is most frequently due to sepsis, which \nis often apparent due to a history of fever, rigors, other infectious \nsymptoms (cough, rash, abdominal pain, urinary urgency, or dys-\nuria} and signs ofhigh cardiac output (warm extremities, bounding \npulses, a wide pulse pressure, and brisk capillary refill). However, \nsome patients with advanced sepsis have a poor cardiac output. \nLaboratory evidence of sepsis often suggests underlying infection, \nincluding a leukocytosis, an infiltrate on chest film, pyuria on uri-\nnalysis, or diagnostic findings on abdominal CT in patients with \nabdominal pain. Finally, patients with cardiogenic shock often have \na history of CAD or HF or symptoms of acute MI. Their physi-\ncal exam suggests locardiac output (poor capillary refill, narro\npulse pressure, and cold extremities) and may also reveal evidence \nof high filling pressures (jugular venous distention [JVD] or an S3 \ngallop). The physical exam, ECG, and echocardiogram can deter-\nmine whether cardiogenic shock is secondary to poor contractility, \noutfloobstruction, an arrhythmia, reduced filling, or backflo\nfrom valve failure. \nThe final pivotal step addresses patients in whom the initial \nevaluation does not ddineate a likdy etiology of shock. Patients \nwith evidence of a high cardiac output (wide pulse pressure, brisk \ncapillary refill, warm extremities) without an obvious source of sep-\nsis, should be evaluated for unusual causes of systemic inflamma-\ntory response syndrome (SIRS) (eg, pancreatitis), occult infections, \nand other causes of distributive shock (liver failure, anaphylaxis, \nadrenal insufficiency). Patients with evidence of a locardiac out-\nput of unclear etiology (narropulse pressure, sluggish capillary \nrefill, cold extremities) should be evaluated for occult massive hem-\norrhage (eg, intra-abdominal) and less common causes of cardio-\ngenic shock such as PE and pericardial tamponade. Such patients \nshould also be evaluated for septic shock. An echocardiogram can \nbe useful in such patients by revealing unsuspected cardiac etiolo-\ngies {eg, pericardial tamponade, acute aortic regurgitation due to \ndissection, or right HF suggesting PE). \nFinally, it is important to realize that overlapping etiologies \nare common, especially septic and cardiogenic shock. Figure 25-1 \nillustrates the diagnostic approach to shock. \nMs. P is clearly hypotensive, (especially given her prior his-\ntory of hypertension) and the combination of her hypotension, \ntachycardia, and difficulty staying awake clearly suggest inade-\nquate tissue perfusion and shock. The first pivotal step considers \nthe 3 most common categories of shock: hypovolemic, septic, and \ncardiogenic. \n\nMs. P has vomited once this moming, 1:7ut she ate and drank \nfluids normally the day before. She denies diarrhea, melena, \nor 1:7r!ght red blood per rectum. She denies any chest pain \nor pressure. She admit s to urinary frequency over t he last \nfedays and ch!lls and fever that 1:1egan the previous night. \nOn physical exam her temperature is 38.4\"C. Her hands \na re cool but pulses are full with adequate capillary refi II. Her \nneck veins are flat and lungs are clear. There Is no JVD or \nS3 gallop. She has costovertebral a~ le tenderness. Labo-\nratory exam reveals a WBC of 15,00 0/mcL and her lactate \nwas 3 mmol/L. \nAt this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altarnatlva&, and Is \nthere a muet not miee diagnoele? Givan this \ndifferential diag noeis, what taete ehould be \nordered? \nMs. P has several features suggesting septic shock. Her urinary \ntract symptoms, fever, and coscovertebral angle tenderness point \nto a possible urinary tract infection. Her leukocytosis is also sug-\ngestive. Septic shock is therefore the leading and must not miss \nhypothesis. Her episode of vomiting suggests some hypovolemia \nbut her hypotension is out of proportion to her 1 episode of eme-\nsis. Another possible diagnosis would be hypovolemia due to an \nosmotic diuresis from severe diabetic hyperosmolar state. Finally, \ngiven her diabetes mdlitus and prior CAD, cardiogenic shock from \nan acute MI needs to be considered. Table 25-1 lists the differential \ndiagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: Septic Shock \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with septic shock typically have fever, tachypnea, tachy-\ncardia, and hypotension. Whereas patients with cardiogenic or \nhemorrhagic shock often have cold extremities, patients with septic \nshock often have warm extremities and bounding pulses after fluid \nresuscitation. (Pulses are bounding due to a widened pulse pres-\nsure.) Mentation may be impaired and urinary output decreased. \n\n' \nHYPOTENSION I 431 \nReviehistory, phyelcal exam, and laboratory teete tor clues tor eepele, cardiac fallure, hypovolemla \nHistory: \nCardiac history, chest pain, CAD risk factors \nHistory of dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrtlage, melena, bright red blood per rectum \nInfectious history: Fever, rlgors, cough, skin or line infections, urinary tract symptoms \nPhysical exam: \nVital signs: Fever, tachypnea, pulse pressure \nSigns of high output shock: Warm extremities, bounding pulses, brisk capillary reftil, wide pulse pressure \nSigns of cardlogenic shock: JVD, Sa gallop, crackles on exam, cold extremities, slocapillary refill \nInfectious signs: Catheter site redness or purulence, focal lung findings, abdominal tenderness \nLllbondory teete: \nCBC, BMP and lactate, urinalysis \nChest film (pulmonary edema) \nECG \nTroponin \nI \nHistory of dehydration, hemorrhage \nCold extremities, small pulse \npressure, poor refill \nHistory of CAD, HF or symptoms of Ml \nCold extremities, small pulse pressure, \npoor refill, JVD, S3 gallop \nFever, rash, cough, urinary symptoms, \nwide pulse pressure, brisk capillary refill, \nwarm extremities, focal lung findings, \nabdominal tenderness, \nHypovolemlc \nshock \nECG evidence of Ml or positive troponin CVAT, skin findings \n. \nCan:llogenlc ahock \nRevieECG, chest film, troponins \nEchocardiogram \nConsideran~ography \nAntlythrnoganlc \n.... \nPoor contractltty \nMl,HF \nReduced fllllng \n_...., Pneumothorax, tamponade, \nmltral stenosis \nOutfloobstruction \n....

Epidemiology \nI. The annual incidence of sepsis exceeds 1,000,000 cases \nper year in the United States. \n2. Most common sources of infection are the lung, abdomen, \nurinary tract, and N catheters. Commonly overlooked \nsources include sinusitis (associated with nasogastric rubes), \nacalculous cholecystitis, and C/ostridium difficile colitis. \nB. Pathophysiology \nI. Sepsis \na. Occurs when an infection {bacterial, fungal, \nmycobacterial, or viral) causes a non-homeostatic host \nresponse to infection. \nb. There is significant biologic and clinical heterogeneity \ndue to factors associated with both the pathogen and \nthe host (eg, age, comorbid conditions, medications, \ngenetics). \nc. A noninfectious process (eg, acute pancreatitis) may also \ntrigger a similarly dysregulated immune response. \n2. In early stages of sepsis, hyperimmune responses may \nplay a role in the organ dysfunction and cause multiple \norgan dysfunction syndrome, hypotension, disseminated \nintravascular coagulation, and death. \n3. In later stages of sepsis, patients may be hypoimmune. \nHypoimmunity may also contribute to infection and death. \n4. Mechanisms of hypotension include \na. Vasodilation (decreased systemic vascular resistance) \nmediated by elevated nitrous oxide levels, increased \nprostacyclin levels, and lovasopressin levels, \nlowers BP. \nb. Cardiac output can be increased or decreased in sepsis. \n(1) The drop in systemic vascular resistance decreases \nafterload, which often results in an increase in CO. \n(2) On the other hand, leakage of fluid out of \nintravascular space can decrease venous return and \nthereby decrease CO. \n(3) In addition, myocardial function can be reduced \nand also decrease CO. \nc. Typically, the initial hemodynamic response is decreased \nsystemic vascular resistance and increased CO (particularly \nafter fluid resuscitation). \n5. Multiple organ dysfunction is often seen. \na. Lung involvement: acute respiratory distress syndrome \nsecondary to increased permeability with subsequent \nnoncardiogenic pulmonary edema. \nb. Acute kidney injury secondary to \n(1) Hypotension \n(2) Renal vasoconstriction \n(3) Increased tumor necrosis factor \nc. Disseminated intravascular coagulation: Multiple \nmediators are involved, including decreased protein C \n(see Chapter 8, Bleeding Disorders, for details). \n6. Lactic acidosis is common in sepsis and has many causes. \na. Microcirculatory lesions impair oxygen delivery. \n(1) Dysregulation of supply and demand \n(2) Microvascular occlusion \nb. Hypotension impairs oxygen delivery. \nc. Mitochondrial injury impairs oxygen utilization. \nd. Decreased hepatic clearance of lactate contributes to \nlactic acidosis. \nC. The current accepted definitions for sepsis and septic shock \nincorporate the Sequential [Sepsis-Related] Organ Failure \nAssessment Score (SOFA) (Table 25-2). \n1. Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused \nby a dysregulated host response to infection and is diagnosed \nwhen there is suspected or documented infection and an acute \nincrease oh 2 SOFA points {a proxy fur organ dysfunction). \n2. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory \nand cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to \nsubstantially increase mortality, and is diagnosed when there \nis sepsis and lactate > 2 mmoUL with persistent hypotension, \ndespite adequate fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressor \ntherapy needed to elevate mean arterial pressure ~ 65 mm Hg. \nD. There is an increased risk of septic shock in patients with bac-\nteremia (21 %), advanced age(~ 65 years), impaired immune \nsystem, community-acquired pneumonia, abdominal infec-\ntion, and markedly elevated WBC. \nE. The mortality rate associated with sepsis ranges from 20% to \n50%. Predictors of mortality include \n1. Age > 40 years \n2. Comorbidities: AIDS, liver failure, HF, diabetes mellitus, \ncancer, or immunosuppression. \n3. Temperature< 35.5C \n4. Leukopenia < 4000 cells/mcL \n5. Hospital-acquired infection \n6. Candida, Pseudomonas, or Staphylococcus aureu.s infection \n7. Inappropriate antibiotics: appropriate antibiotics are \nassociated with a 50% decrease in mortality. \n\nHYPOTENSION I 433 \nTable 25-2.

Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) \nScore is a validated scoring index that predicts mortality in \npatients arriving at emergency departments with suspected \ninfection (Figure 25-2). \n10. Serum lactate levels \na. Lactate levels risk stratify patents with suspected \ninfection, even among those without apparent shock, \npresumably due to the identification of undetected \nhypoperfusion. The mortality in normotensive patients \n(systolic BP ~ 90 mm Hg) with suspected infection and \na lactate level~ 4.0 was 15% vs. 2.5% in those with \nlactate levels < 4.0 mmol/L. \nb. Lactate levels also predict mortality in patients with \nshock. The mortality rate of patients with shock and \nlactic acidosis is 70% compared with 25-35% in \npatients with shock without lactic acidosis. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Predictors ofbacteremia (Table 25-3) \n1. Fever \na. In emergency department patients, fever was higher \namong bacteremic patients (38.8C) than nonbacteremic \npatients (38.l\"C).

The absence of fever in patients with bacteremia was \nassociated with increased mortality. \n2. Chills \na. Chills can vary from mild to moderate to shaking chills \n(ie, teeth chattering, bed shaking chills). \nb. Chills of some kind (mild, moderate, or severe) are \ncommon in bacteremic patients (sensitivity 88%). \nc. Shaking chills (rigors) are less sensitive but more specific \nfor bacteremia (sensitivity, 45%; specificity, 90%; LR+, \n4.7; LR-, 0.61). \nClinicians should consider bacteremia in \nolder patients with significant fever or rigors. \nPatients with rigors should have blood cultures \ndrawn and antibiotics administered. \n3. Rashes: Certain life-threatening infections may produce \ncharacteristic rashes (ie, meningococcemia, Rocky Mountain \nspotted fever, or staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome). \nPatients with fever and a rash should be imme-\ndiately evaluated for life-threatening diseases, \nincluding toxic shock syndrome, meningococ-\ncemia, or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. \n4. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have a high \nincidence ofbacteremia (38% and 69%, respectively). \nS. WBC > 15,000/mcL is only 28% sensitive for bacteremia. \n~ \nA n0<nul WBC do< not rufo out b>aoremfa. \n6. Catheter site infections \na. Signs of inflammation at the insertion site are uncommon \nin patients with central venous catheter infections \n(sensitivity, 27%). Erythema is present in only 3% of \npatients with catheter-related bloodstream infections. \n~ \nConsider central catheter line infection in septic \nV\" patients even in the absence of erythema or pus. \nb. Certain findings are highly specific for catheter \ninfection, including gross pus at the catheter site. \n7. Injection drug use or an acute abdomen (or both) also \nincrease the risk of bacteremia. \n8. Incidence ofbacteremia is lo(2%) in patients without any \nof the following risk factors: \na. Temperature > 38.3\"C \nb. Shaking chills \nc. Injection drug use \nd. Acute abdomen on exam \nc. Major comorbidity (defined as coma, brain death, \nbawd perforation, multiple trauma or burns, cardiac \narrest within last 24 hours, transplantation, severe \npancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or \nliver failure) \n9. Procalcitonin is an emerging marker of bacterial infection. \na. Polypeptide produced at higher levels during bacterial \ninfection \nb. Procalcitonin's rdease is attenuated by cytokines released \nduring viral infections, particularly interferon-gamma. \nc. Elevated levels suggest bacterial infections whereas \nnormal levels in sepsis suggest a syi;temic inflammatory \nresponse without bacterial infection. \nd. The accuracy is limited (sensitivity, 77%; specificity, \n79%; LR+, 3.7; LR-, 0.29) and results must be viewed \nin context of all of the clinical data. \n10. A lactic acidosis can suggest sepsis. Serum lactate levels are \nmore sensitive for detecting a lactic acidosis from any cause \nthan an increase in the anion gap. An elevated anion gap is \nonly 44-67% sensitive. \nB. Cultures from suspected sources (blood, urine, spumm, fluid \ncollection) should be obtained as soon as possible in patients \nevaluated for sepsis. If central catheters are in place, blood \nshould be obtained peripherally and through the central \ncatheter. \nTreatment \nA. The treatment of septic shock is complex. \nB. The principles of treatment include the following: \n1. Treat the underlying cause \n2. Prompt volume resuscitation \n3. A variety of other therapies may be critical, including \nvasopressors, inotropes, intubation and mechanical \nventilation, blood products, and others. \n4. Recommendations evolve frequently. Readers are referred \nto speciali7.Cd text for details. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMs. P has several features that suggest sepsis, Including \nher fever, urinary symptoms, and leukocytosls. An ECG \nshows no acute changes and a serum troponin level is unde-\ntectable. Her blood glucose is 150 mg/dl . \nHave you crossed a diagnostic threshold for \nthe leading h;ypothesis, sepi;ic: shook? Havs \nyou ruled out the actlv111 attsrnatlv111e1 Do \noth111r tests nlll&i to be done to exclude the \nalternative diagnoses? \n\nAlternative Diagnosis: Hypovolemic Shock \nTypically, a patient with hypovolemic shock will have an obvious \nsource of bleeding, a drop in hematocrit, or recognizable gastroin-\ntestinal fluid or renal losses. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Patients who are hypovolemic have 1 of 2 clinical conditions: \n1. Volume depletion due to vomiting, diarrhea, inadequate \noral intake, or excessive diuresis (from diuretics or \nuncontrolled diabetes) \n2. Hemorrhage (due to trauma, gastrointestinal or intra-\nabdominal hemorrhage) \nB. Hospitalizations related to gastrointestinal hemorrhage are \ncommon, 150/100,000 population per year, and have a case \nfatality rate of3-10%. \nC. Degree of bleeding is often difficult to assess. \n1. Melena can occur with massive hemorrhage or as little as \n100 mL of blood loss. \n2. Admission hematocrit correlates poorly with degree of \nblood loss and mortality. \nD. Hypovolemia secondary to dehydration sufficiently severe to \ncause hypovolemic shock disproportionately affects the elderly. \nCommon risk factors include: \n1. Female sex \n2. Age> 85 \n3. Greater than 4 chronic medical conditions \n4. Taking 4 or more medications \nS. Being confined to bed \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. In a revieof physical exam findings in hypovolemia, \nabnormal vital signs are relatively specific but not sensitive \n(fable 25-4). \nHYPOTENSION I 435 \n1. Orthostatic vital signs, particularly an increase in pulse \nare more sensitive than supine vital signs. Orthostatic \nhypotension can occur immediately or be delayed. \na. When measuring orthostatic vital signs, wait 3 minutes \nbefore measuring supine vitals and wait 1 minute after \npatient stands to measure upright vitals. \nb. Helpful physical findings include: \n(1) Severe postural dizziness (unable to measure upright \nvital signs due to dizziness). \n(2) Postural pulse increment of 30 beats/ min \nor more. \n2. Dry axilla supports hypovolemia in the elderly (sensitivity, \n50%; specificity, 82%; LR+ 2.8; LR-, 0.61). \n3. Poor skin turgor has no proven diagnostic value \nin adults. \nB. Laboratory evidence is often more revealing. \n1. Hematocrit \na. Decreased in hemorrhage if bleeding has been \nongoing \nb. However, in acute bleeding, blood loss prior to \nhemodilution (from N or oral fluid repletion) may \nresult in a normal hematocrit. \n~ \nPatients may have a normal hematocrit despite \ny \nmassive hemorrhage. \nc.

He has a history of a bicuspid aor-\ntic valve and aortic stenosis. One week ago, he underwent a \nmechanical aortic valve replacement. He denies any recent \nnausea, vomiting, melena, or bright red blood per rectum. He \nhas not had a cough, dysurla, urinary frequency, abdominal \npain, or fever. On physical exam his pulse is 115 bpm and BP \nis 85/65 mm Hg. His neck veins are visible to the angle of \nhis jaand his skin is cool. \n~~ At this point, what ie the leading hypotheeie, \n1~r what are the actlws alternatlvn, and le there a \nmuet not mlee dlagno51e1 Given this differential \ndlagnoele, what tnte ehould be ordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe first step in the evaluation is to recognize shock. Mr. Xs BP \nis exceptionally lofor a 71-year-old man. His BP, combined \nwith his complaint of weakness and cool extremities, makes shock \nlikely. The next pivotal diagnostic step is to evaluate the history, \nphysical exam, and laboratory data to determine if this is likely \nhypovolemic, septic, or cardiogenic shock. There are no signs or \nsymptoms of sepsis, nor any history to suggest hypovolemia. His \ncool extremities are consistent with a locardiac output state \n(which is often seen in hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock) and his \n]VD suggests that the locardiac output is due to cardiogenic, \nnot hypovolemic, shock. Furthermore, his past medical history \nincreases the probability of cardiogenic shock. Possible ctiologies \nof cardiogenic shock include poor contractility (potentially from \nLY or RV MI or preexistent HF), outfloobstruction (due to, \nfor example, aortic stenosis or PE), backflo(from acute aortic \nregurgitation or a regurgitant aortic valve), or reduced filling (from \ntamponade or a stenotic mitral valve). Given the patient's history, \nyou consider MI to he most likely.

Cardiogenic shock is defined as persistent hypotension \n(systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) or mean arterial pressure 30 mm Hg \nlower than baseline with severe reduction in cardiac index \n(< 1.8 Umin/m2) and adequate or elevated filling pressure \n(LY end-diastolic pressure> 18 mm Hg or RV end-diastolic \npressure> 10-15 mm Hg). \nB. The majority of cardiogenic shock cases are related to ML \n1. The incidence of cardiogenic shock appears to be decreasing \nwith increasing use of percutaneous intervention for acute MI. \n2. However, cardiogenic shock still complicates 5-8% of \nSTEMI and 2.5% of non-STEMI. \na. This translates to 40,000 to 50,000 cases per year in the \nUnited States. \nb. Infarction location is anterior in 55% of cases and in \nmultiple locations in 50% of cases causing cardiogenic \nshock. \nc. In the SHOCK trial registry, 53.4% of patients have \n3-vessel disease and 15.5% have significant left main \ndisease. \n3. Risk factors for cardiogenic shock include \na. Older age \nb. Anterior MI \nc. Hypertension \nd. Diabetes mellitus \ne. Multi-vessel CAD \n Prior MI or angina \ng. Prior diagnosis of HF \nh. STEMI \ni. Left bundle branch block \n4. The magnitude ofLV ejection &action reduction does \nnot need to be profound for shock to develop. In a large \nregistry of cardiogenic shock, the mean LY ejection &action \nwas30%. \n5. Mechanical complications of MI (rupture of the ventricular \nseptum, free wall or papillary muscles) cause 12% of \ncardiogenic shock cases. \na. Ventricular septal rupture has a monality of 87%. \nb. Women and elderly are at increased risk for these \ncomplications, particularly elderly individuals who \nundergo thrombolysis. \nC. Any cause of severe RV or LY dysfunction can lead to cardio-\ngenic shock. Other typical etiologies include: \n1. Acute myocarditis \na. Cardiogenic shock complicates 10-15% of cases. \nb. Patients are younger than those with MI and often \npresent with dyspnea rather than chest pain. \n2. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy \na. Stress-induced condition that leads to apical ballooning \nafter emotional or respiratory distress. \nb. Leads to cardiogenic shock in 4.2% of cases. \n3. Acute valvular regurgitation \n4. Aortic dissection causing either acute, severe aortic \ninsufficiency or extension of dissection to coronary arteries \nleading to infarction. \n5. Acute hemodynamic stress in the setting of mitral or aortic \nstenosis (ie, decreased preload or marked increase in afterload) \n6. Cardiac tamponade \nHYPOTENSION I 431 \n7. PE \n8. Arrhythmia \nD. Pathophysiology \n1. In MI effecting the LY, decreased coronary perfusion \nlowers cardiac output, which further decreases coronary \nperfusion. \n2. Hypoperfusion causes catecholamine release and activation \nof the renin-angiotensin system increasing contractility \nand peripheral blood flobut also increasing myocardial \noxygen demand and promotes arrhythmia. \n3. This leads to further ischemia and greater reduction in \ncardiac output. \n4. Activation of the neurohormonal cascade also leads to salt \nand water retention and exacerbates pulmonary edema. \n5. Treatment relies on breaking this cycle. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nThe diagnosis of the individual etiologies of cardiogenic shock (eg, \nMl, PE, etc) is covered elsewhere. The focus of this section will be \non the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock itself. \nA. Diagnosing cardiogenic shock relies on recognizing signs of \ndecreased cardiac output despite an adequate or elevated filling \npressure. However, signs and symptoms have limited accuracy \nin detecting elevated filling pressures. \n1. Jugular venous pressure <!: 12 cm H20 sensitivity, 65%; \nspecificity, 64%; LR+ 1.8; LR-, 0.55 \n2. In a single-center study, elevation of the external jugular \nvein (> 10 cm H,,20) correlated with an elevated catheter-\nmeasured c:entraJ venous pressure. \na. Senior students and interns: sensitivity, 61 %; specificity, \n75%; LR+ 2.4; LR-, 0.5 \nb. Junior and senior residents: sensitivity, 78%; specificity, \n93%; LR+ 11.1; LR-, 0.2 \n3. 2 pilloorthopnea (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 25%; LR+ \n1.1; LR-, 0.56) \n4. Cold extremities (sensitivity, 20%; spec:ificity, 88%; LR+ \n1.7; LR-, 0.9) \n5. The proportional pulse pressure can suggest cardiogenic \nshock. \na. Typically, the pulse pressure increases as the systolic BP \nincreases. \nb. A relatively lopulse pressure compared to the systolic \nBP suggests a lostroke volume. \nc. Proportional pulse pressure (PPP = (systolic BP -\ndiastolic BP) I systolic BP) \nd. A PPP < 25% is 10% sensitive, 96% specific (LR+ 2.5; \nLR-, 0.94) for cardiac index < 2.3 LI (min-m2). This \nmust be measured with manual BP cuff. \nB. Once the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock is considered and \nthe need for immediate catheterization for treatment of acute \nMI (the most common cause) is assessed, echocardiography \nshould be performed. \nC. Bedside portable ultrasound is becoming more prevalent and \nhas been shown to be useful in assessing the cause of cardiogenic \nshock as well as in undifferentiated shock. \n1. It is especially useful to \na. Assess for pericardial effusion \nb. Determine global cardiac systolic function \nc. Identify marked LY or RV enlargement \n\n438 I CHAPTER 25 \nd. Gauge intravascular volume status by assessing inferior \nvena cava diameter and respiratory variation. \n2. Data suggests hand held devices are accurate in residents \nwith limited training (3 hours of didactic training and \n5 hours of hands-on training) \na. LY dysfunction: 88% sensitive, 89% specific, LR+ 8, \nLR-0.13 \nb. Pericardial effusion: 83% sensitive, 96% specific, \nLR+ 20.8, LR- 0.18 \nTreatment \nComplete discussion of the treatment of c:ardiogenic shoclc is \nbeyond the scope of this chapter. However, when c:ardiogenic shoclc \nis a result of myocardial ischemia, early rcvascularization (percuta--\nneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) \nresults in a significant survival benefit and is clearly indicated. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nAn ECG showed no evldence of Ml and troponlns were nor-\nmal. Chest film revealed an enlar~ cardiac silhouette. \nMeasurement of pulsus paradoxus demonstrated a pulsus \nof12mmHg. \nThe patient's clinical picture suggests cardiogenic shock but the eti-\nology remains obscure. Neither the ECG nor troponins suggest an \nacute MI. You consider the shoclc is due to one of the less common \ncauses of cardiogenic shoclc (tamponade, valve failure). \nLeading Hypothesis: Cardiac Tamponade \nTextbook Presentation \nWeakness, hypotension, and tachycardia are typically present. \nOther classic findings include an elevated jugular venous pressure \nand muffied heart sounds. However, the signs and symptoms ass<>-\nciated with tamponade are quite nonspecific. \nDisease Higblighta \nA. Cardiac tamponade \nI. Results when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, \ncompresses the heart, and causes a reduction in cardiac \nfilling and therefore cardiac output \n2. May occur secondary to either a peric:ardial effusion or \npericardial hemorrhage \nB. A!. the signs and symptoms associated with it are nonspecific, \ndiagnosing cardiac tamponade relies on understanding the \nconditions that can lead to pericardial effusion and careful \nassessment. \nC. The incidence of cardiac tamponade and pericardial effusions \nare not well documented, and there is little data regarding ho\noften pericardial effusions progress to tamponade. However, \nperic:ardial effusions are not uncommon; therefore, identifying \nclinically significant effusions is of great importance. \n1. Common etiologies of peric:ardial effusions that may lead \nto tamponade include \na. Idiopathic pericarditis (20-30%) \nb. Malignancy (13-36%) \nc. Cardiac procedures (16%) \nd. Infection {5-21 %) \nc. Acute MI (8%) \nf. Collagen vascular disease (5%) \n2. Of these, effusions due to infection {bacterial, fungal, \nHIV-associated infections) and neoplasm have the greatest \nincidence of progression to tamponade. \n3. Cardiac tamponade occurs in up to 1-2% of patients \nfollowing cardiac surgery and invasive cardiology procedures \nand commonly occurs as late as 7 days postoperatively. \n4. Cardiac tamponade was found in almost 19% of patients \nwith a type A aortic dissection. These patients had \nsignificantly higher mortality. \nD. Tamponade has a wide range of presentations depending on \nperic:ardial fluid volume, accumulation rate, and degree of \ncompression. It is typically grouped into 2 main types: \n1. Acute tamponade \nL Occurs following traumatic injury, rupture of the \nheart or aorta, or an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic \nprocedure. \nb. Presents with cardiogenic shoclc (cool extremities, \naltered mental status, peripheral cyanosis, and ]VD) \n2. Subacute tamponade \nL Occurs in the setting of inflammatory disease or \nmalignancy. \nb. Symptoms often mimic HF (fatigue, dyspnea, chest \nfullness). \nc. Pericardial effusion may reach as much 2 L before \ntamponade physiology occurs. \nE. Physiology: Tamponade occurs as increasing intrapericardial \npressure compresses the cardiac chambers. The key compo-\nnents that determine when tamponade occurs are the rate of \nfluid accumulation relative to pericardial stretch. \n1. True filling pressure of the heart is the transmural pressure, \nwhich is calculated as follows: intrac:ardiac pressure -\npericardial pressure. \n2. Rising pericardial pressure offsets intracardiac pressure at \nsome point and leads to competition for the chambers to fill: \na. During systole, reduced ventricular volume leads to \ndecreased pericardial pressure and atrial filling is preserved. \nb. During diastole, increased ventricular volume leads to \nincreased pericardial pressure, decreased atrial transmural \npressure and as tamponade approaches, late diastolic \natrial collapse. \nc. As the pericardial effusion continues to increase and \npericardial pressure rises, the ventricles compete for \nlimited space. This stress more easily affects the RV and \ncan lead to early diastolic collapse of the RV. \n3. During inspiration, decreased pleural pressure is transmitted \nto the pericardium and causes increased transmural pressure \nand increased venous return and right heart filling. In \ntamponade this RV expansion compresses the LY and results \nin shift of the interventricular septum and decreased \npulmonary venous return and reduced stroke volume. \n4. As cardiac output drops, increases in heart rate, \ncontractility, and peripheral arterial vasoconstriction defend \ncirculation until circulatory collapse occurs. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Signs and symptoms \n1. Tachypnea and dyspnea nearly always present with cardiac \ntamponade (87-88%). \n\n2. Other common findings in patients with cardiac tamponade \nare tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure and pulsus \nparadoxus with pooled sensitivities of76--82%. \n3. Chest pain, cough, fever, lethargy, and palpitations are \npresent ins 25% of patients. \n4. Hypotension and diminished heart sounds are insensitive \n(28% and 26%, respectively). \n5. Pulsus paradoxus \na. Defined as an exaggerated decrease in BP with normal \ninspiration \nb. The paradox comes from decreased S}'5tolic BP despite \nincreased venous return during inspiration. \nc. In tamponade, when inspiration increases RV filling, \nthe expansion of the RV within the confined pericardial \nspace pushes the interventricular septum to the left and \ndiminishes left heart filling causing cardiac output and \nBP to drop. \nd. Additionally, inspiratory expansion of the lungs leads to \npulmonary venous pooling and even further reduced LY \nfilling. \ne. When the LY diastolic pressures are elevated as in end-\nstage renal disease, cardiac tamponade does not result in \npulsus paradoxus. \nMaking an accurate measurement of pulsus \nparadoxus requires a manual sphygmomanom-\neter, a quiet location, and patience. \nB. ECG findings associated with tamponade are insensitive. Lo\nvoltage QRS and electrical alterans have estimated sensitivities \nof 43% and 16-21 %, respectively. \nC. Chest radiography: Cardiomegaly on chest film is common \nwith a pooled sensitivity of 89%. \nD. When cardiac tamponade is suspected, transthoracic echoc-\nardiography is the primary diagnostic test to confirm the \ndiagnosis. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMs. M Is a 7 0-yea r-old woman who arrives at the eme1\"9ency \ndepartment complaining of shortness of breath and dlzzl-\nne5s. On physical exam, her pulse is 105 bpm. BP 75/45 \nmm Hg, and her skin exam is notable for hives. She is warm \nand ha5 bounding pulses. The patient recently underwent \nsurgery to have a mechanical mltral valve placed and took \namoxlclllln for the first tlme as prophylaxis for an upcoming \ndental procedure. \nAs noted above, the first step in the evaluation of the hypoten-\nsive patient is the recognition of shock. The patient's profound \nhypotension, panicularly at this age, and dizziness suggest symp-\ntomatic hypotension and inadequate cerebral perfusion diagnostic \nof shock. The first pivotal diagnostic step is to consider whether \nHYPOTENSION I 439 \nE. The main findings on the transthoracic echocardiography \ninclude a pericardial effusion associated with the following: \n1. Late diastolic collapse of the right atria \n2. Early to mid diastolic collapse of the RV \n3. Septal shift toward the left during inspiration and toward \nthe right with expiration \n4. Suppression of deep inspiratory collapse of the inferior \nvena cava \nTreatment \nA. Once cardiac tamponade is diagnosed, pericardial drainage is \nrequired unless tamponade is due to aonic dissection or free \nwall rupture. \nB. Symptomatic management may be used if the patient is \nhemodynamically stable or in a \"pre-tamponade\" state. This \nconsists primarily of volume resuscitation with isotonic fluids \nand supplemental oxygen until drainage can be performed. \nC. Pericardiocentesis can be accomplished under ultrasound \nguidance at the bedside in the ICU if needed emergently. \nAlternatively, this can be performed under ultrasound or fluo-\nroscopic guidance in the catheterization laboratory. \nD. If the effusion is loculated, there is a need for pericardial win-\ndow, or if the effusion is due to acute traumatic hemopericar-\ndiurn, surgical pericardiotomy is required. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nEchocardlography revealed a large pericardia! effusion with \nlate diastolic collapse of the right atrium. The pat ient was \ntaken to t he catheterlzatlon laboratory U1\"9ently and under-\nwent perlcardlocentesls; 500 ml of blood was removed. \nThe patient felt better Immediately. His BP Increased to \n110170 mm Hg and his pulse dropped to 75 bpm. \nthe history and physical exam suggest 1 of 3 leading causes of \nshock: septic shock, hypovolemic shock, or cardiogenic shock. \nHer bounding pulses and warm extremities suggest distributive \nshock, a high output form of shock. As mentioned above, the most \ncommon form of distributive shock is septic shock, a must not \nmiss hypothesis. However, her hives and recent use of amoxicillin \nis a pivotal clue that suggests another cause of distributive shock, \nanaphylactic shock. This is both the leading and must not miss \nhypothesis. Table 25-6 lists the differential diagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: Anaphylactic Shock \nTatbook Presentation \nAnaphylaxis is an acute S}'5temic reaction caused by lgE-mediated \nimmunologic release of mediators from mast cells and basophils to \nallergenic triggers like food, insect venom, or medications. Typi-\ncally, the reaction may affect the patient's skin, the cardiovascular \nsystem, or respiratory system. Anaphylactoid reactions produce the \nsame clinical picture; however, they are not immune-mediated. \n\n440 I CHAPTER 25 \nTable 25-6.

Triggers and mechanisms \nImportant \nTuts \nElevated WBC \nUrinalysis \nChest radiograph \nOther imaging as \nindicated \nBlood cultures \n1. Foods are most common triggers in infants, children, and \nteenagers. \na. & much as 2% of the US population may have food \nallergies. \n(1) Peanut allergies are most common in children. \n(2) Shellfish allergies are most common in adults. \nb. Each year in the United States, there are as many as \n100 deaths due to anaphylactic reactions to food. \n2. When the cause of anaphylaxis is identified in adults, the \nmost common culprits are antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs, with penicillins responsible for 75% \nof fatal cases. \nB. The patient history is the most imponant tool to determine \nwhether a patient has had anaphylaxis and the cause of the \nepisode. \n1. Respiratory symptoms may include nasal stuffiness or \nitching; difficulty in breathing; retrosternal tightness; \nor oral, pharyngeal, epiglottic, or glottis edema. \n2. Cardiovascular symptoms include dizziness, chest tightness, \nor oven hypotension. \n3. Skin complaints include itching, warmth, minor swelling, \nor characteristic urticaria. \n4. Severity, onset, and symptom patterns may vary considerably \nand results in discrepancies in diagnosis. \nC. The estimated lifetime prevalence of anaphylaxis is 0.05-2%. \nHowever, even the high-end estimate may be too loas sig-\nnificant evidence points toward underreporting of anaphylaxis. \nI. In Australia, anaphylaxis admissions doubled from 1995 \nto 2005 to over 10:100,000 population. The increase in \nincidence is likely more pronounced among young patients, \nwith food the most common trigger. \n2. Deaths related to medicin~induced anaphylaxis have \nincreased 300%. Medicines account for 57% of anaphylaxis-\nrelated deaths. \nD. Physiology \n1. Interaction of antigen with mast cell lgE or direct drug \nactions (by histamine, leukotrienes, kinins, prostaglandins \nor platelet activating factor) cause mast cells to release the \nmediators of anaphylaxis. \n2. These mediators cause vasodilation and the leakage of fluid \nfrom capillaries and the post-capillary venules resulting in \nhypotension. \n3. Several of these substances, in particular leukotrienes, cause \nrespiratory symptoms related to bronchoconstriction and \nincreased mucus production. \n4. When untreated, death may result from hypoxemia due \nto upper airway angioedema, bronchospasm and mucus \nplugging and/or shock resulting in multiorgan S}'5tem failure. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The sudden onset of skin, cardiovascular, and respiratory \nsymptoms should point toward a diagnosis of anaphylaxis. \n1. However, even if just 2 of these organ S}'5tems are involved, \nor hypotension alone, anaphylaxis should be considered. \n2. Often, these reactions may be self-limited; however, failure \nto make a diagnosis puts the patient at risk for future life-\nthreatening allergen exposure. \nB. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDisease, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is highly likely if any the \nfollowing criteria are met: \n1. Acute onset of an illness (within minutes to several hours) \nwith involvement of the skin, mucosa! tissue, or both (eg, \ngeneralized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-\nuvula) and at least I of the following \nL Respiratory compromise (dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, \nstrider, reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia), or \nb. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ \ndysfunction (hypotonia, syncope, or incontinence). \n2. 2 or more of the following symptoms after exposure to \na likely allergen or other trigger for that patient within \nminutes to several hours \na. Skin or mucosa! symptoms \nb. Respiratory compromise \nc. Reduced BP or associated symptoms \nd. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms \n3. Reduced BP (S}'5tolic BP < 90 mm Hg or > 30% decrease \nfrom baseline) after exposure to a known allergen for that \npatient (minutes to hours) \n4. The test characteristics for the criteria are sensitivity, 95%; \nspecificity, 71 %; LR+, 3.3; LR-, 0.07. \nC. The sensitivity of individual findings: \nI. Diffuse urticarial in 39% \n2. Pruritus 61 % \n3. Lip angioedema 49% \n4. Tongue angioedema 39% \n5. Wheezing 49% \nD. Mature tryptase is released from mast cells when activated. \nTherefore, measurement of tryptase can be useful to confirm a \ndiagnosis of anaphylaxis. \nI. An increase> 2.0 mcg/L between arrival, 1 hour later and just \nbefore discharge was 75% sensitive for severe anaphylaxis. \n2. This test does not have benefit at the time of presentation; \nhowever, it may be beneficial to ensure that a diagnosis of \nanaphylaxis is made when appropriate and minimize the \nrisk for recurrence. \n\nTreatment \nA. Initial management of suspected anaphylaxis relics on quick \nrecognition and appropriate supportive care. \n1. Assess patient's circulation, airway, breathing, mental status, \nskin, and body weight. \n2. Inject intramuscular epinephrine in the mid-anterolateral \naspect of the thigh, 0.01 mg/kg of a 1 :1000 (1 mg/mL), \nmaximum 0.5 mg (adult), or 0.3 mg (child). Repeat in \n5-15 minutes if needed. \n3. H 1- and H2- antihistamines as wdl as corticosteroids are \nconsidered second-line agents and are not considered \nessential medications for the treatment of anaphylaxis. \nIf given, antihistamines may decrease itching, flushing, \nurticarial, and nasal symptoms but have no effect on airway \nobstruction or hypotension. \n4. Corticosteroids do not affect the initial symptoms of \nanaphylaxis but may reduce the likelihood and severity of \nprotracted symptoms. There is no consensus regarding the \ntype of corticosteroid, the route, or the dose that may be \nbeneficial. \n5. Place the patient on their back and elevate lower extremities. \n6. If indicated, provide respiratory support; this may range \nfrom supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to mechanical \nventilation. \n7. Establish IV access with wide-bore cannula (16 gauge if \npossible) and bolus 1-2Lof0.9 normal saline. \nB. Once the patient recovers from the acute episode, steps must \nhe taken to prevent a recurrence. \n1. Provide self-injectable epinephrine from an auto-injector. \n2. Establish an anaphylaxis emergency plan and medical \nidentification of the patient's allergy (bracelet, wallet card). \n3. Referral to an allergy/immunology specialist to confirm \nsensitivity to a specific allergen and to discuss long-term \nrisk reduction strategies including immune modulation. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nAnaphylactlc shock was quickly reCO!:jnlzed, and Ms. M \npromptly received an IM injection of epinephrine as well as \nfluids.

It is helpful to reviesome \nbasic physiology first. \nA. Oxidation of the heme moiety of hemoglobin generates biliv-\nerdin, which is metabolized into unconjugated bilirubin, and \nthen bound to albumin. \nB. There are 3 steps in bilirubin metabolism in the liver \n(Figure 26-1): \n1. Uptake: The unconjugated bilirubin-albumin complex \nreaches the hepatocyte; bilirubin dissociates from albumin \nand then enters the hepatocyte. \n2. Conjugation: Unconjugated bilirubin and glucuronic acid \ncombine to make conjugated bilirubin. \n3. Excretion: The hepatocyte excretes conjugated bilirubin \ninto the bile. \na. The rate-limiting step of bilirubin metabolism in the liver \nb. If excretion is impaired, conjugated bilirubin enters the \nhepatic sinusoids and then the bloodstream. \nC. Conjugated bilirubin in the bile is transported through the biliary \nducts into the duodenum; it is not reabsorbed by the intestine. \n1. Can be excreted unchanged in the stool \n2. Can be converted to urobilinogen by colonic bacteria \na. Urobilinogen can be reabsorbed, entering the portal \ncirculation. \nb. Some is taken up by the liver and re-excreted into the bile. \nc. Some bypasses the liver and is excreted by the kidney, \nthus appearing in the urine in small amounts. \nd. Can be convened in the bowel to stercobilin rendering \nthe stool brown. \nD. Unconjugated bilirubin is not found in the urine because it is \nbound to albumin and cannot be filtered by the glomeruli. \nE. Conjugated bilirubin is filtered and excreted in the urine when \nthere is conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. \nThe first pivotal point in the differential diag-\nnosis of hyperbilirubinemia is determining \nwhich kind of bilirubin is elevated. \nDark, tea-colored urine means the patient has \nconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. \nLight stools, often described as \"clay colored,\" \noccur when extrahepatic obstruction prevents \nbilirubin from entering the intestine. \nIf the patient has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (> 50% of \nthe bilirubin is unconjugated), use a pathophysiologic framework: \nA. Increased bilirubin production \n1. Hemolysis \n2. Dyserythropoiesis \n3. Extravasation of blood into tissues \nB. Impaired hepatic bilirubin uptake \n1. Heart failure \n2. Sepsis \n3. Drugs (rifampin, probenecid, gemfibrozil, atazanavir) \n4. Fasting \n5. Portosystemic shunts \nC. Impaired bilirubin conjugation (decreased hepatic glucu-\nronosyltransferase activity) \n1. Hereditary \na. Gilben syndrome \nb. Crigler-Najjar syndrome \n2. Acquired \na. Neonates \nb. Hyperthyroidism \nc. Ethinyl estradiol \ncl. Liver disease (causes mixed hyperbilirubinemia; usually \npredominantly conjugated) \ne. Sepsis \nMost patients with unconjugated hyperbiliru-\nbinemia have hemolysis, Gilben syndrome, \nheart failure, sepsis, or very advanced cirrhosis. \n\n444 I CHAPTER 26 \nHem catabollam \nn \nUnconjugated \nvbilirubin \nU\n-95% bilirubin \nabsorbed by \n~~ \ntennlnal Ileum \n~ Enterohepatic \n~ 7 -'~ \nUrinary \nexcretion \nFigure :Z6-1. Bilirubin metabolism and excretion. \nAlthough many sources organize the dilfercntial diagnosis for \nconjugated hyperbilirubincmia (when > 50% is conjugated) using \na pathophysiologic framework, a more practical, clinical approach \nuses the results of other liver biochemical tests first: \nA. Normal liver enzymes (ALT, AST) \n1. Sepsis or systemic infection \n2. Rotor syndrome \n3. Dubin-Johnson syndrome \nB. Elevated liver enzymes \n1.

Cholestatic pattern: alkaline phosphatase more elevated \nthan transaminascs, suggesting either intrahepatic or \ncxtrahepatic biliary obstruction \na. Exttahcpatic cholestasis (bile duct obstruction) \n(1) Common bile duct stone \n(2) Benign stricture \n(3) Benign polyp \n(4) Malignancy (pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma. \nampullary cancer) \n(S) Periportal adenopathy \n(6) Primary sclcrosing cholangitis (affects both \nintrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts) \nh.

The differential of unconjugatcd hyper-\nbllirubincmia is relatively limited. If the hypcrbilirubincmia is \nconjugated, the second step is co determine whether there is enra-\nhcpatic obstruction or intrinsic hcpatocellular dysfunction due to 1 \nof many possible etiologies. Although other liver biochemical tests \ncan serve as a guide, it is clear from the way the above differentials \noverlap that these tests are not very specific.

Given this dlffim!Jntla[ \ndlagn05is, what tnte 5hould be ord6red1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe pattern of the biochemical abnormalities is the next pivotal \npoint to consider. The combination of a substantially elevated \nalkaline phosphatase and moderatdy elevated transaminases is con-\nsistent with a cholestatic pattern due to either a disease causing intra-\nhepatic cholestasis or to extrahepatic obstruction. Viral or alcoholic \nhepatitis, with or without cirrhosis, would be the most common \ndiseases that cause both hepatocellular and cholestatic abnormal-\nities; the AST being greater than the ALT is a pivotal finding that \npoints toward alcoholic liver disease. The physical exam findings of \nhepatomegaly and splenomegaly both modestly increase the likeli-\nhood of chronic liver disease (LR+, 2.3 for hepatomegaly; 2.9 for \nsplenomegaly). Extrahepatic obstruction must also be considered, \nsince she could have an obstruction in addition to chronic liver \ndisease. Cancer and stricture are more likely causes of painless jaun-\ndice than common bile duct stones. Pancreatic cancer is the most \ncommon malignancy that causes extrahepatic obstruction; cholan-\ngiocarcinoma and ampullary carcinoma are 2 other possibilities. \nOccasionally, obstruction is due to benign polyps in the biliary \ntree. Table 26-2 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nMs. B had a blood t ransfusion in Latvia in 1996.

Alcohol ingestion is the most important risk factor for ALD. \n1. Beer and spirits are more associated with ALD than wine. \n2. Drinking outside of meal time and binge drinking increase \nthe risk. \nB. Other risk factors include female sex, African-American and \nHispanic ethnicity, obesity, and genetic factors. \nC. ALD is more frequent and worse in patients with other chronic \nliver diseases, especially hepatitis C. \nD. There are 3 hisrologic stages: steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis, \nand chronic hepatitis with fibrosis or cirrhosis. \n1. Hepatic steatosis is generally asymptomatic. \nJAUNDICE AND ABNORMAL LIVER ENZYMES I 441 \na. 70% of patients have hepatomegaly \nb. Occurs in up to 90% of patients who consistently \nconsume> 6 drinks (60 g) per day \nc. Potentiates liver damage from other insults, such as \nviral hepatitis or acetaminophen toxicity, and promotes \nobesity-related liver disease. \ncl. Usually completely reversible with abstinence from \nalcohol for 4-6 weeks \n(1) Despite abstinence, cirrhosis will develop in 5-15% \nof patients with steatosis. \n(2) Cirrhosis develops in 30% of those who continue \nto drink. \n2. Alcoholic steatohepatitis occurs in 15-30% of patients \nwithALD. \na. Often presents acutely in the conrexc of chronic liver disease \nb. Symptoms often include fever, hepatomegaly, ascites, \nencephalopathy, AST:ALT ratio> 1.5, and leukocytosis, \nall in the context of heavy alcohol use. \nc. Malnutrition is seen in 90% of patients. \ncl. Concomitant cirrhosis is found in > 50% of patients \nwith alcohollc hepatitis. \ne. 3-month mortality between 15% (mild alcoholic hepatitis) \nand 55% {severe alcoholic hepatitis) \n Several tools have been developed to risk stratify patients \nwith alcohollc hepatitis. \n(1) The Modified Discriminant Function (mDF) = 4.6 \nx (patient PT - control PT} + serum bilirubin level: \npatients with a score ~ 32 have a poor prognosis \n(2) The Mayo End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score \nincorporates the total bilirubin, international \nnormaliud ratio (INR), and serum creatinine (http:// \nwww.mayocllnic.org/meld/mayomodel7.html). \n(a) A MELD score> 11 is similar to an mDF ~ 32 \nin predicting mortality. \n(b) A MELD score> 20 1 week after admission \nhad a sensitivity of 91% and specificity 85% for \nidentifying patients who will die within 30 days. \n(3) The GlasgoAlcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS) \nincludes age, WBC count, BUN, PT/INR, and \ntotal bilirubin (http://www.mdcalc.com/ glasgow-\nalcoholic-hepatitis-score/): a score~ 9 is associated \nwith a poor prognosis and has an accuracy of 81 % \nin predicting 28-day mortality. \n3. Cirrhosis (also see Chapter 17, Edema} \na. Increased risk in men who consume > 60-80 g/day and \nwomen who consume > 20 g/ day of alcohol for ~ 10 years. \n(One standard drink contains 14 g of alcohol.) \n(1) Only 6-41 % of such individuals develop cirrhosis \n(2) Fibrosis develops in 40-60% of people who \nconsume > 40-80 g/day for 25 years \nb. In patients without any other chronic liver disease, 21 \ndrinks/week in men and 7-14/week in women probably \nwill not lead to ALD. \nc. The prognosis of alcoholic cirrhosis varies, depending \non whether the patient stops consuming alcohol. \n(1) 5-year survival of75% if patient becomes abstinent \n(2) 5-year survival of 50% if patient continues to \nconsume alcohol \n(3) 5-year survival of 35% once complications of \ncirrhosis appear \n\n448 I CHAPTER 26 \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. ALD is diagnosed by documenting alcohol excess in the pres-\nence of liver disease. \nB. Biomarkcrs such as GGT, AST, and ALT are not sensitive or \nspecific enough to diagnose ALD; macrocytosis may be seen \nbut is also insensitive. \nC. Alcoholic steatosis is diagnosed by seeing fatty infiltration on \nimaging in patients with excessive alcohol consumption. \nD. Alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical diagnosis. \n1. Criteria used in randomized trials of therapy include \nhistory of excessive alcohol consumption; serum bilirubin \n> 4.5 mg/dL; AST < 500 units/L; ALT < 300 units/L; \ncxclusion of acute viral, autoimmune, obstructive, or \nmalignant liver disease. \n2. Transaminases are elevated but generally< 6-7 times the \nupper limit of normal. \na. AST :ALT ratio > 2 in 70-80% of patients, with ratios \n> 3 being more specific \nb. Another study showed mean ratio of2.6 for patients \nwith alcoholic liver disease, compared with mean of0.9 \nfor patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; however, \nthere was some overlap. \n3. GGTP (garnma-glutamyl transpeptidase) is often elevated, \nand the GGTP/alkaline phosphatase ratio is often> 2.5. \n4. Imaging (with ul~onography or CT) is most helpful \nfor ruling out other diagnoses; can variably see fatty \ninfiltration, hepatomegaly, ascites, or cirrhosis. \nS. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis but is not \nalways necessary. \nE. Cirrhosis is diagnosed when portal hypcnension is present or \non biopsy (also sec Chapter 17, Edcma). \nT!fttment \nA. Abstinence is the primary treatment for all forms of ALD. \nB. Although the data are conflicting, current guidelines recom-\nmend that patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, defined as \nan mDF score::!! 32, should be treated with conicosteroids; \npentoxifylline could be considered in patients intolerant of \ncorticosteroids. \nC. Patients with advanced disease or alcoholic hepatitis should \nbe assessed for nutritional deficiencies and repleted as \nnecessary. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMs. B's transaminases are consistent with, but not diag-\nnostic of. ALD. An imaging study Is necessary not to rule \nIn ALD but rather to exclude alternative d!aenoses. As \ndiscussed in Chapter 3, Abdominal Pain, ultrasonography \nis the best first test to look for stones in the gallblad-\nder, although the sensitivity is less for common bile duct \nstones. However, in this patient, pancreatic cancer or other \nmalignancies are more likely causes of extra biliary obstruc-\ntion than stones. Although an abdominal CT scan is argu-\naPly a better first test to exclude these posslbilltles, an \nultrasound is often obtained first in clinical practice aue to \nits lower cost and lack of adverse effects. Tests for hepa-\ntitis are necessary in all patients with liver disease and are \nespecially important In Ms. B because of her history of a \nblood transfusion. \nMs. B has an ultrasound that reveals no stones In the \ngall111adder and no common bile duct stones. An abdominal \nCT scan Is obtained next. which shows an enlarged, nodular \nliver. moderate ascites, and a normal pancreas. Her ANA. \nhepatitis A lgM antibody, HBsAg, hepatitis B lgM core anti-\nUody, and hepatitis C antiooay are all negative. \nHavs you aroeeed the diagnoetk; threehold for \nthe leading hypotheele, alcoholla hepatitle1 \nHave you rulet.I out the aative altematlvse1 \nDo other test& nelltd to be done to e>CGlude the \naltcJmatlve diagnON&1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Pancreatic Cancer \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with pancreatic cancer often have vague abdominal pain \nfor weeks or months, followed by weight loss and perhaps the \nabrupt onset of painless jaundice. \nDisease Highlights \nA. > 90% of cases are ductal carcinomas; 60-70% are in the pan-\ncreatic head, 20-25% in the body or tail, and 10-20% involve \nthe whole organ \nB. Risk factors \nI. Smoking (related in up to 20% of cases) and family history \nof pancreatic cancer (present in 7-10% of patients) arc the \nmost important risk factors. \n2. Other risk factors include the following: \na. Family history of chronic pancrcatitis, older age, male \nsex, African-American ethnic origin \nb. Diabetes, obesity \nc. Non-0 blood group \nd. Occupational exposures (chlorinated hydrocarbon \nsolvents and nickel) \ne. High fat diet; high meat/lovegetable diet \nC. Clinical presentation \nI. Symptoms are insidious and often present for more than \n2 months; depression is the first symptom in 38-45% of \npatients. \n2. Abdominal pain and weight loss are common presenting \ncomplaints, occurring in 80% and 85% of patients, \nrespectively. \n3. Back pain is prominent if splanchnic nerve or celiac plexus \ninfiltration occurs. \n4. Jaundice \na. 80% of patients with cancers in the head; more if mass \nis>2cm \nb. Can occur when the cancer is in the body but is then \ndue to liver metastases \nc. Can be painless or associated with abdominal pain \nS. Less common presentations include acute pancreatitis, \nmalabsorption, migratory thrombophlebitis, and \ngastrointestinal bleeding. \n\n6. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), a \npotential precursor lesion of pancreatic ductal carcinomas, \nare increasingly being detected incidentally on abdominal \nimaging. \na. Histopathologic evaluation, usually through endoscopic \nultrasound and fine-needle aspiration, in addition to \nimaging is critical for identifying high-risk lesions that \ncan inform treatment decisions. \n(1) IPMN lesions< 10 mm in size can be monitored \nwith surveillance imaging. \n(2) Those > 30 mm in size or with high-risk MRI \ncharacteristics should be biopsied. \n(3) The approach to those between 10 mm and 30 mm \nin si7.C is unclear. \nb. If pancreatic cancer develops, the 5-year survival is -50%, \nwhich is much higher than ductal adenocarcinoma. \nEvidence-Based. Diagnosis \nA. The first imaging study in most patients presenting with jaun-\ndice is an ultrasound. \n1. Sensitivity, 75-89%; specificity, 90-99% \n2. The sensitivity may be less in obese patients or with less \nexperienced sonographers. \nB. If the ultrasound showi; a pancreatic mass, the next test should \nbe a triphasic pancreatic-protocol multidetector CT. \n1. Sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 90%; LR+, 8.6; LR-, 0.16 \n2. Sensitivity lower for cancers< 2 cm (77%) compared with \nthose> 2 cm (89%) \n3. Best test for determining potential resectability \nC. If an initial ultrasound does not shoa mass, pancreatic \nprotocol CT, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography \n(MRCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), or endoscopic retro-\ngrade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be done. \n1. MRCP is noninvasive with similar sensitivity and \nspecificity to pancreatic protocol CT. \n2. EUS requires endoscopy but does not lead to as many \ncomplications as ERCP; sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 89%; \nLR+, 8.5; LR-, 0.06. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr.Risa 24-year-old graduate student with no past med-\nical history who comes to see you because his girlfriend \nthought his eyes looked yelloyesterday. He has felt tired \nand a bit queasy for the last couple of weeks but thought \nhe was just overworked and anxious. He has had some ach-\ning pain In the right upper quadrant and eplgastrlum, not \nrelated to eating or bowel movements. He has had no fevers, \nchllls, or sweats. He has noticed dark urine for 1 or 2 days \nbut attributed it to not drinking enough. \nJAUNDICE AND ABNORMAL LIVER ENZYMES I 449 \n3. ERCP is invasive and has a sensitivity of only 50-60% \nfor detecting pancreatic cancer, with a specificity of94%; \ncomplications include pancreatitis and hemorrhage. \nD. CA 19-9 \n1. For levels above 37 units/mL: sensitivity, 77%; specifl.city, 87% \n2. For levels> 1000 units/mL, specificity is 94-100%. \nTreatment \nA. Complete resection is possible in -15% of patients; 5-year \nsurvival is still only 20-25%. \nB. Palliative approach for patients with nonresectable cancer \n1. Biliary diversion, either percutaneous or surgical \n2. Radiation therapy for pain relief \n3. Gemcitabine for improved quality of life but not increased \nsurvival \n4. Median survival is 6 months. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nWith an LR- of 0.16, a normal CT scan does not always rule out \npancreatic cancer. However, in this patient, given that her CT scan \nshowi; evidence of advanced liver disease (a more likely diagnosis \nfur her), it is not necessary to do further imaging studies. The other \nactive alternative, chronic hepatitis, is ruled out by her negative \nserologies. These test results, combined with her alcohol intake his-\ntory, makes ALO the most likely diagnosis. At this point, some cli-\nnicians would proceed with treatment for alcoholic hepatitis, while \nothers would confirm the diagnosis and, fur prognostic purposes, \nestablish the presence or absence of cirrhosis with a liver biopsy. \n\nHer liver biopsy showed acute alcoholic hepatit is with cir-\nrhosis. Because her mDF was > 32. she was treated with \nprednisolone. She was also advised to abstain from alco-\nhol. She completed the course of prednlsolone and has \nremained abstinent. Several weeks later, her bilirubin was \nnormal and she felt well. \nOn physical exam, he appears tired. He has scleral lct-\nerus; h ls liver Is palpable 2 cm belot he costal margin and Is \nmildly tender. The spleen is not palpable. and t he rest of his \nabdomen is nontender and nondistended. He has no edema. \nand the rest of his exam is norm a I. \nAt this point, what le ths lsading hypothssis, \nwhat are ths actlvs altsrnatlvse, and le \nthere a mu et not m IH dlag noel!i? Glvsn thle \ndifferential diagnosis, what tssts should 11s \nordered? \n\n450 I CHAPTER 26 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe differential diagnosis for fatigue, nausea, and vague abdominal \npain is broad, but the pivotal findings of scleral icterus and tender \nhepatomegaly point toward a hepatic source. \nMr. R's clinical picture is consistent with that of the majority \nof patients with viral hepatitis: a history of anorexia, malaise, and \nnausea, and a physical exam showing hepatomegaly, hepatic ten-\nderness, or both. Hepatitis A is the most frequent cause of acute \nviral hepatitis; hepatitis C is the second most frequent but is usu-\nally asymptomatic acutdy. Hepatitis B can also present acutdy. \nBy virtue of being common, alcoholic hepatitis is another active \nalternative diagnosis, and the presentation can mimic that of viral \nhepatitis. Biliary obstruction is always a consideration in patients \nwith jaundice, but the prodtome and type of abdominal pain are \nnot typical. Table 26-3 lists the differential diagnosis. \nHe has no past medical history and takes no medications: \nhe does not smoke or use Illicit drugs. He drinks 1-2 beers \nmost weeks, and occasionally shares a bottle of wine with \nfriends. He has never had a blood transfusion or a tattoo, \nand has had only 1 sexual partner. He enjoys trying differ-\nent restaurants, and frequently eats sushi and ceviche. \nInitial laboratory tests include the following: total bilirubin, \n6.5 mg/ d L; conjugated billru '11n,4 mg/ dl; ALT. 1835 un lts/L; \nTable26-3.

This pattern is consistent with viral hepatitis. Exploring \nhis history, he does not have clear risk factors for hepatitis B or C, \nbut does have potential exposure to contaminated food, suggesting \npossible hepatitis A. \nLeading Hypothesis: Hepatitis A \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is the gradual onset of malaise, nausea, \nanorexia, and right upper quadrant pain, followed by jaundice. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Prevalence: Accounts for approximately half of cases of viral \nhepatitis in the United States. \nB. Clinical manifestations \n1. Symptoms develop in 70-80% of adults, compared with \n< 30% of children under the age of 6. \n2. Average incubation period is 28 days (range 15-50 days), \nfollowed by prodromal symptoms of fatigue, malaise, \nnausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, and right upper pain; \nabout 1 week later, jaundice appears. \n3. 70% of patients have jaundice, and 80% have hepatomegaly. \n4. Other physical findings include splenomegaly, cervical \nlymphadenopathy, rash, arthritis, and leukocytoclastic \nvasculitis. \nS. Uncommon extrahepatic manifestations include optic \nneuritis, transverse myelitis, thrombocytopenia, and \naplastic anemia. \nC. Transmission \n1. Fecal-oral transmission, either sporadically or in an \nepidemic form \na. Contaminated water, shellfish, frozen strawberries, etc. \nb. Contamination from infected restaurant worker \nc. No specific exposure history in 55% of cases \n2. No matemal-fetal transmission \nD. Clinical course \n1. Generally sdf-limited, with rare cases of fulminant hepatic \nfailure (0.015-0.5% of patients with hepatitis A) \na. Fulminant course is more common in patients with \nunderlying hepatitis C or other chronic liver diseases. \nb. 1.1 % fatality rate in adults > age 40 \n2. 85% of patients fully recover in 3 months, and nearly \n100% by 6 months \n3. Transaminases normalize more rapidly than serum bilirubin. \nE. Prevention \n1. Vaccination is available for preexposure prophylaxis. \na. Immunity develops within 4 weeks in 90% of patients \nand within 26 weeks in 100% of patients. \n\nb. A second dose given 6-12 months later provides persistent \nimmunity. \n2. Can use immune serum globulin with vaccination for \npostexposure prophylaxis. \na. For otherwise healthy patients between ages 12 months \nand 40 years, only vaccination is recommended; \nimmune serum globulin can still be considered. \nb. For patients < 12 months, > 40 years, or any age who \nare immunocompromised, such as those with chronic \nliver disease, immune serum globulin should be \nadministered. \nc. Immune globulin is 69-89% effective in preventing \nsymptomatic illness when used within 2 weeks of \nexposure. \nd. A randomized trial comparing vaccination with immune \nglobulin given within 14 days of exposure found that \nhepatitis A devdoped in 4.4% of vaccine recipients and \n3.3% ofimmune globulin recipients (rdative risk = 1.35 \n(95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.70 to 2.67). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Liver biochemical tests \n1. ALT and AST are generally over 1000 units/L, and may be \nas high as 10,000 units/L; ALT is generally > AST. \n2. Bilirubin is commonly> 10 mgfdL. \n3. Alkaline phosphatase is usually modestly devated. \nB. Antibody tests (Figure 26-3) \n1. Serum lgM anti-HAY detects acute illness, being positive \neven before the onset of symptoms and remaining positive \nfor 4-6 months. \n2. LR+ 99; LR-, 0.01 \n3.

Although Mr. R's history of food exposure \nsuggests hepatitis A, it is generally necessary to test for all 3 of the \nprimary hepatitis viruses since the exposure history for both hepa-\ntitis B and C is often unclear. \n\nHl5 hepatlt!5 A lgM antibody !5 po5ltlve. with nfltlve \nHB5Ag, lgM antl-HBc, and antl-HCV. \nHave you croseed a dlagnoetlc threshold for \nthe leading hypothHle, acute hepatitis A'I \nHave you ruled out the active alternatlvee'I \nDo other teete nsed to be dons to sxclude the \naltemativs dlagnoeee1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Acute Hepatitis B \nTatbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is the gradual onset of malaise, nausea, \nanorexia, and right upper quadrant pain followed by jaundice. \nHepatitis B is often subclinical. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers \n1. About 5% worldwide, with substantial geographic \nvariation \na. 0.1-2% (loprevalence) in the United States, Canada, \nJapan, and Western Europe \nb. 2-8% (medium prevalence) in Mediterranean countries, \ncentral Asia, the Middle East, and Latin and South \nAmerica \nc. 10-20% (high prevalence) in Southeast Asia, China, \nand sub-Saharan Africa \nB. Clinical manifestations \n1. 70% of adult patients have subclinical infection or are \nanicteric; 30% of patients have icteric hepatitis \n2. Incubation period is 1--4 months. \n3. Symptoms are similar to those of hepatitis A, but serum \nsickness-like syndrome can be part of the prodrome (fever, \nurticarial rash, arthralgias). \n4. Fulminant hepatic failure occurs in 0.1--0.5% of patients, \nwith a mortality rate of 80% without liver transplant. \nC. Transmission \n1. In high prevalence areas, transmission is primarily perinatal, \noccurring in 90% of babies born to hepatitis B envdope \nantigen (HBeAg)-positive mothers and in 10-20% born \nto HBeAg-negative mothers. \n2. In medium prevalence areas, most infections occur from \nchildhood exposure to contaminated household objects, via \nminor breaks in the skin or mucous membranes. \n3. In loprevalence areas, transmission is most often \nsexual, via percutaneous inoculation (eg, injection drug \nuse, accidental needlestick, tattooing, body piercing, \nacupuncture), or from contaminated blood transfusion or \nmedical equipment (such as dialysis equipment). \n\n452 I CHAPTER 26 \nD. Prevention of hepatitis B \n1. Vaccination for prcexposure prophylaxis \n2. Vaccination ane/HB immune globulin within 12 hours for \nperinatal exposure and within 1 week for other postexposure \nprophylaxis {percutaneous, mucosal, or sexual) \n3. Vaccinated individuals will have positive hepatitis B surface \nantibody {anti-HBs) tests. \nEvidence.Based Diagnosis \nA. Liver biochemical tests: similar to hepatitis A \n1. Transaminases normalize in 1-4 months if acute infection \nresolves. \n2. Elevation of ALT for > 6 months indicates progression to \nchronic hepatitis. \nB. Acure infection is diagnosed by the presence of hepatitis B \nsurface antigen (HBsAg) and IgM hepatitis B core antibody \n(IgM anti-HBc). \n1. HBsAg appears 1-6 weeks prior to symptoms or devations \nof transaminases (Figure 26-4). \na. Should be present in patients with acute symptoms \nb. Should clear in 4-6 months, although small amounts of \nviral DNA can be detected in serum and mononuclear \ncells for years after seroclearance \n2. IgM anti-HBc appears 1-2 weeks after HBsAg. \na.

NeYork, NY: McGraw-Hill Education; 2011 .) \nD. HBeAg and anti-HBe historically used to shoviral replica-\ntion and infectivity but have largely been replaced by HBV \nDNA testing. \nTreatment \nA. Supportive therapy: rest, oral hydration, and antiemetic medi-\ncations as needed \nB. Admit if INR is elevated or patient is unable to hydrate orally. \nC. Antiviral therapy is used for chronic infection and antiviral \ntherapy or Uver transplant can be used for fulminant hepatitis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Chronic Hepatitis B \nTextbook Presentation \nManifestations can range from asymptomatic, to isolated fatigue, \nto cirrhosis with portal hypertension. There is often no history of \nclinical acute hepatitis B. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Defined as detection of HBsAg on 2 occasions measured at \nleast 6 months apart \nB. Occurs when the hepatitis B-specific CD4 and CDS response \nis insufficient \nC. Risk of progression from acute to chronic hepatitis B varies, \ndepending on the patient \n1. < 1 % when the acute infection is acquired by an \nimmunocompetent adult \n2. 90% when the infection is acquired perinatally \n3. 20% when the infection is acquired during childhood \nD. Two-thirds of patients are asymptomatic. \nE. 10-20% have extrahepatic findings {eg, polyarteritis nodosa, \nglomerular disease} \nF. There are 4 phases of chronic HBV (Figure 26-5), categorized \nby the activity of the infection, as defined by levels of viral \nDNA, degree of transaminitis, and presence or absence of \nHBe antigen and antibody. (HBe antigen is a secretary protein \nconsidered to be a marker of HBV replication and infectivity. \nThe presence of HBeAg usually indicates high levels of viral \nDNA and rates of transmission.) \n1. The immune tolerant phase occurs when the infection is \nacquired perinatally. \n2. Infections acquired later in life begin in the immune \nclearance phase, characterized by intermittent flares in up \nto 25% of patients per year; 10-20% of patients per year \nseroconvert from HBeAg positive to HBeAg negative and \nbecome HBeAb positive. \n3. Most patients who seroconvert enter a lifelong inactive \nstate; however, 20-30% revert to HBeAg positive or develop \nHBeAg negative chronic hepatitis. \nG. Risk factors for progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis \ninclude high viral DNA levels, longer duration of the immune \nclearance phase, male sex, increasing age, HBeAg positivity; \ngenotype C, concurrent hepatitis C or HIV infection, severe \ninflammatory histology. \nH. Hepatitis B cirrhosis leads to hepatic decompensation in \n15-20% of patients over 5 years. \n1. 5-year survival rate is 80-85% in patients with compensated \ncirrhosis and 30-50% in those with decompensated \ncirrhosis. \n\n2. Each year, hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 2-3% of \nHBsAg-positive patients. \nI. Screening guiddines \n1. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends \nscreening for patients at high risk for hepatitis B \n2. Patients at high risk for hepatitis B include \na. Patients coinfected with HIV and/or hepatitis C \nb. Injection drug users \nc. Household members and sexual parmers of anyone with \nchronic hepatitis B \nd. Men who have sex with men \ne. Healthcare workers \n Patients undergoing hemodialysis \ng. Patients who are incarcerated \nJ. Patients who are at high risk for hepatitis B and screen negative \nshould be offered vaccination. \nJAUNDICE AND ABNORMAL LIVER ENZYMES I 453 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA.

The goals of treatment include suppression of viral DNA levels, \nHBeAg seroconversion, stopping or reducing hepatic inflam-\nmation and necrosis, and preventing progression to cirrhosis. \nB. Current treatment options include nucleos{t)ide analogs, \nsuch as entecavir and tenofovir; and pegylated interferon alfu \ntherapy.

When present, symptoms are similar to those of other viral \nhepatitides and last 2-12 weeks. \nDisease Highlights \nA Accounts for about 15% of cases of acute hepatitis; the most \ncommon cause of chronic hepatitis in the United States \nB. Prevalence and transmission rates \n1. Overall prevalence in the United States is 1 %. \na. 2.6% prevalence in the general population born between \n1945 and 1965 \nb. Largest risk factor is history of injection drug use; \nof patients with hepatitis C, 51 % have prior history of \ninjection drug use. \nc. 1-5% in needlestick exposures and monogamous \npartners of infected persons \nd. 10% in recipients of blood transfusions prior to 1992 \n2. Transmission \na. Since 1992, rarely acquired from blood transfusion \nin developed countries but contaminated blood still \ncommon in undeveloped countries \nb. Now, hepatitis C is primarily transmitted through \ninjection drug use, with occasional cases due to ear \nor body piercing, sex with an injection drug user, or \naccidental needlestic:ks. \nc. Household contacts are rarely infected. \nd. Transmission between monogamous partners is < 1 %/ \nyear; risk of sexual transmission is higher in men who \nhave sex with men, if the index carrier also has HIY. or \nif there are multiple partners. \nc. Perinatal transmission occurs in 4-7% of cases; risk for \ntransmission increases 4- to 5-fold if the mother has \nboth hepatitis C and HIY. \nf. 15-30% of patients report no risk factors \nC. Clinical course \n1. Jaundice develops in only 10-20% of symptomatic \npatients. \n2. Fulminant hepatitis is rare. \n3. Extrahepatic manifestations are common, being found in \nabout 75% of patients. \na. Fatigue, arthralgias, paresthesias, myalgias, pruritus, and \nsicca syndrome are found in > 10% of patients. \nb. Vasculitis secondary to cryoglobulinemia is found in \n1 % of patients, although cryoglobulinemia is present in \nabout40%. \nc. Depression and anxiety are more common than in \nuninfected persons. \n4, 74-86% of patients have detectable HCV RNA at \n6 months and therefore have chronic hepatitis C. \nS. Spontaneous clearance is more likely to occur in females, \nthose infected with genotype 3, whites, and those with a \nlopeak viral load. \nD. Chronic hepatitis C \n1. Liver histology ranges from no fibrosis, to varying degrees \nof fibrosis, to cirrhosis; there are several scoring systems \nin use. \n2. There is no correlation between ALT levels and liver \nhistology. \n3. Noninvasive testing or liver biopsy is indicated in many \npatients to guide treatment decisions {see Chapter 17, \nEdema for discussion of noninvasive methods to predict \nfibrosis and cirrhosis}; the complication rate for liver biopsy \nis 1-5%. \n4. Cirrhosis devdops in 7-18% of patients after 20 years of \ninfection. \na. Liver histology is the best predictor of progression to \ncirrhosis. \nb. Other predictors of progression to cirrhosis include \n(1) Age at infection (> 40 years of age 4 more \nprogression) \n(2) Longer duration of infection \n(3) Consumption of alcohol> 50 g/day \n(4) HIV or HBV coinfection \n(S) Male sex \n(6) Higher ALT \n(7) Baseline fibrosis \nc. Hepatocellular carcinoma devdops in 1-3% of cirrhotic \npatients per year. \nE. Prevention \n1. No vaccine available \n2. No role for immunoglobulin \nF. Screening guidelines \n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US \nPreventive Services Task Force recommend 1 time screening \nfor all persons born between 1945 and 1965 as wdl as risk \nfactor-based screening \n\n2. Risk factor-based screening includes \na. History of injection drug use \nb. Receipt of blood products prior to 1992 \nc. Long-term hemodialysis \nd. Exposure to known HCV-positive blood (needlestic:k or \nmuc:osal exposure in health care workers) \ne. HN infection \nf. Child of a HCV-positive woman \ng. History of multiple sex partners or sexually transmitted \ninfections \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Anti-HCV antibody tests (enzyme immunoassays} \n1. HCV antibodies generally detectable within 8-12 weeks of \nacquiring the infection. \n2. Sensitivity, 94-100%; specificity, 97-98%; LR+, 31-49; \nLR-, 0.01-0.06 \n3. False-positive results do occur in loprevalence screening \npopulations, with positive predictive values as loas 39%. \n4. False-negative results c:an occur in immunocompromised \npatients, such as organ transplant recipients, HN-\ninfected patients, hemodialysis patients, or those with \nhypogammaglobulinemia. \n5. Unlike hepatitis A and B, the presence of antibodies does \nnot indicate clearance of infection; patients with positive \nanti-HCV antibodies must be evaluated for ongoing \ninfection. \nB. Quantitative HCV RNA tests (polymerase chain reaction and \ntranscription-mediated amplification) \n1. Lower limit of detection using current methods is 10-50 \ninternational units/ml. \n2. Sensitivity, 96%; spec:iflcity, 99%; LR+, 96; LR-, 0.04 \n3. Levels do not correlate with liver injury, duration of infection, \nor disease severity. \nC. Genotype testing \n1. Used for prediction of response to treatment, choice of \ntreatment duration, and choice of therapy. \n2. Genotypes do not change, so this test needs to be done \nonly once. \n3. In the United States, 71.5% of cases are from genotype 1, \n13.5% from genotype 2, 5.5% from genotype 3, and 1.1 % \nfrom genotype 4. \nD. Choosing and interpreting hepatitis C tests \n1. American Association for the Study of Liver Disease \nGuidelines for testing: \na. First, test for anti-HCV antibodies in patients in whom \nacute or chronic hepatitis C is suspected. \nb. Test for HCV RNA in patients with (1) a positive \nantibody test; (2) unexplained liver disease whose antibody \ntest is negative and who are immunoc:ompromised or in \nwhom acute HCV infection is suspected. \n2.

He feels much better when he retums \n1 month later. \nThe best test of the liver's synthetic: function is \nthe PT. It is important to check the INR in all \npatients with hepatitis to look for signs of liver \nfailure. \nConcomitant infection with HIY, in addition \nto the other viral hepatitides, should be ruled \nout in any patient diagnosed with hepatitis A, \nB, or C. In patients diagnosed with hepatitis B \nspecifically, hepatitis D c:oinfection should also \nbe excluded. \n\n456 I CHAPTER 26 \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMs.His a 40-year-old woman with unexpected transami-\nnase abnormalities. \n~ \nWhat is the dlffisnsntfal diagnosis of mild \n1~r asymptomatic traneamina68 elevations1 Ho\nwould you frame the dlffisrentlal1 \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMost patients with asymptomatic transaminase elevations have \nmild or moderate elevations; it is very unusual for patients with \nmarked elevations to be asymptomatic. Therefore, the diagnostic \nthinking should focus on chronic diseases. The basic framework \nseparates hepatic from nonhepatic causes. \nA. Hepatic causes \nI. Marked elevations (> 1000 units/L) \na. Acute viral hepatitis \nb. Ischemic hepatitis \nc. Medication- or toxin-induced hepatitis \nd. Autoimmune hepatitis \ne. Acute bile duct obstruction \nf. Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome \n2. Mild to moderate elevations \na. ALO \nb. Medications/toxins \nc. Chronic hepatitis B or C \nd. NAFLD \ne. Autoimmune hepatitis \nf. Hemochromatosis \ng. Wtlson disease (in patients < 40 years old) \nh. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency \nB. Nonhepatic causes \n1. Celiac disease \n2. Hyperthyroidism \n3. Inherited disorders of muscle metabolism or acquired \nmuscle disease (AST elevation only) \n4. Strenuous exercise (AST elevation only) \nMs. H comes In for a routine nepatient visit. She feels fine. \nHer past medical history Is notable for type 2 diabetes mel-\nlitus and hypertension. Her medications include metformin, \natorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril. She does \nnot smoke and has a glass of wine about twice per month. \nShe has no history of blood transfusions or Injection drug \nuse. Her physical exam shows a BP of 125/80 mm Hg. pulse \nof 80 bpm. RR of 16 breaths per minute, weight 230 lbs. \nand height 5 ~ 9 In (BMI \"' 34.0). Pulmonary, cardiac, and \nabdominal exams are all normal. \nShe shows you blood test results from a recent health \nfair at work: creatinlne, 0.9 mg/dL; HbA1,, 6.8%; LDL, \n95 mg/c:IL; platelet count , 272/mcL; bilirubin, 0 .8 mg/c:IL; \nAST. 85 units/L; ALT. 92 units/L; albumin. 4 .0 g/dL; and \na normal alkaline phosphatase. She reports she was told \na femonths ago that 1 of her liver tests was a little \nabnormal. No one In her family has had liver disease, but her \nmother has thyroid disease. She does recall taking sev-\neral acetaminophen tablets in the days prior to t he recent \nblood test. \nAt this point. what is the leading hypothesis, \nwhat ans the active alternatiVfJS, and is thens a \nmust not miff diagnoels1 Given this dtffe1'8ntlal \ndlagna&le, what tote ehould be ordensd1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nIn the absence of an obvious nonhepatic cause of liver enzyme ele-\nvations, the initial approach is to focus on the hepatic causes. The \nprevalence of the liver diseases in the differential diagnosis varies \nwidely, depending on the population studied. For example, in a \nstudy of over 19,000 young, healthy military recruits, of whom \n99 had enzyme elevations, only 11 were found to have any liver \ndisease (4 had hepatitis B, 4 had hepatitis C, 2 had autoimmune \nhepatitis, 1 had cholelithiasis). A study of 100 blood donors with \nelevated enzymes found that 48% had ALO, 22% had NAFLD, \nand 17% had hepatitis C. In another study, patients with elevated \nenzymes in whom a diagnosis could not be made by history or \nblood tests underwent liver biopsy; NAFLD was found in over \n50% of them. \nPivotal points in Ms. H's presentation include that the tran-\nsaminase abnormalities are mild and probably chronic. The key \nfindings in the history and physical exam are the patient's diabe-\ntes and elevated body mass index (BMI}. NAFLD is extremely \ncommon in obese, diabetic patients, so Ms.His at high risk for \nthis disease. She has no specific risk factors for viral hepatitis, but \noften the exposure history is unclear and these diagnoses cannot \nbe ruled out without funher testing. Her alcohol intake is mini-\nmal, but sometimes even small amounts of alcohol can cause liver \nenzyme elevations. Additionally, other drug and toxin exposures \nalways should be considered. Even therapeutic doses of acetamin-\nophen can cause transaminitis; in 1 study, 50% of patients taking \n4 g of acetaminophen daily developed transaminases > 2 times the \nupper limit of normal. Mild transaminase elevations are seen in \n0.5-3% of patients taking statins (it is not necessary to stop the \nstatin in such cases, and the FDA no longer recommends routine \ntesting after obtaining a baseline at the start of therapy). Finally, \nher family history of thyroid disease, presumably autoimmune, \nincreases the likelihood of autoimmune hepatitis or hyperthyroid-\nism. Hemochromatosis can also present with liver enzyme abnor-\nmalities and diabetes mellitus. Table 26-6 lists the differential \ndiagnosis. \n\nMs. H abstains from alcohol and stops taking any acet-\na mlnophen and atorvastatln for 2 weel::s.

It is common to identify patients \nby finding hepatomegaly on exam or asymptomatic transaminase \nelevations. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The definition ofNAFLD is evidence of excessive fat in the \nliver, either by imaging or biopsy, in the absence of causes of \nsecondary hepatic fat accumulation. \nJAUNDICE AND ABNORMAL LIVER ENZYMES I 457 \nB.

Prolonged total parenteral nutrition \n5. Protein-calorie malnutrition \n6. Medications \na. Methotrexate \nb. Amiodarone \nc. Estrogens \nd. Corticosteroids \ne. Aspirin \n Cocaine \ng. Antiretroviral agents \nC. Patients with NAFLD have steatosis, either with or without \ninflammation. \n1. In simple steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL]), there \nis no liver injury and the risk of progression to cirrhosis is \n<4%. \n2. Steatosis plus inflammation, with or without fibrosis, is \ncalled nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a \nhistologic diagnosis. \na. Up to 21 % of patients with NASH and fibrosis have \nregression of fibrosis. \nb. Up to 40% progress to more advanced fibrosis or \ncirrhosis \nc. The strongest predictor of progression is the degree of \ninflammation on the first biopsy. \nd. Annual risk ofhepatocellular carcinoma 1-2% \n3. Decompensated cirrhosis devdops over 10 years in 45% of \npatients. \n4. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with \nNAFLD cirrhosis is less than that of patients with hepatitis C \ncirrhosis. \nD. NAFLD can coexist with other chronic liver diseases. \nE. Epidemiology \n1. Risk factors include \na. The metabolic syndrome \nb. Obesity \nc. Type 2 diabetes mellicus \nd. Insulin resistance \ne. Hyperlipidemia \n Family history ofNAFLD \n2. Prevalence varies based on population studied. \na. Worldwide prevalence is approximately 25%, higher \nin the Middle East and South Asia; NASH prevalence \n3-5% \nb. In patients with NAFLD in North America, 80% are \nobese, 25% have diabetes, and 83% have hyperlipidemia. \nc. Found in > 95% patients undergoing bariatric surgery \nand 50% of patients attending lipid clinics \nd. Second most common reason for liver transplant and \nwill likely overtake hepatitis C in the near future \n3. Most common cause of abnormal liver test results in the \nUnited States. \n\n458 I CHAPTER 26 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA. Blood tests \n1. Transaminase elevation is usually < 400 units/L, with \nALT > AST; in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, AST may be \n>ALT. \n2. Serum ferritin is elevated in 60% of patients but is rardy \n> 1000 mcg/L. \n3. Alkaline phosphatase is elevated in 30% of patients. \nB.

Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and staging. \n1. NASH is missed in 27% of single biopsies. \n2. Test characteristics of a single biopsy for the diagnosis of \nNASH \na. Sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 92% \nb. LR+, 8.6; LR-, 0.3 \n3. Advanced fibrosis is less often missed: LR+, 7.7; LR-, \n0.16 \nD. Liver biopsy should be considered when it is necessary to \nexclude other causes of chronic liver disease and in patients \nwith a high risk of having NASH and advanced fibrosis. \n1. The NAFLD Fibrosis Score is used to identify high-risk \npatients. \na. Need to knoage, BMI, diabetes status, ALT, AST, \nalbumin, and platelet count \nb. Online calculator: http://nafldscore.com/ \nc. A high score (> 0.676) significantly increases the \nlikelihood of advanced fibrosis (LR+, 16.5); loand \nintennediate scores are not as helpful. \n2. Patients with the metabolic syndrome are also considered \nhigh risk \nE. Other modalities fur noninvasively quantifying hepatic fibrosis \ninclude transient elastography and magnetic resonance \nelastography. \nTreatment \nIt is necessary to rule out other causes of liver \ndisease listed in the above differential before \ndiagnosing NAFLD. \nA. Weight loss can improve both steatosis and inflammation. \nB. Exercise may improve steatosis independent of weight loss. \nC. Diabetes and hyperlipidemia should be optimally treated. \nD. Metformin has been studied and is not effective. \nE. Vitamin E has been shown to improve histology in nondia-\nbetic adults with biopsy proven NASH. \nF. Pioglitazone is effective in reducing inflammation but its effect \non fibrosis is uncertain; the long-term safety and efficacy are \nnot established. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nYou should take a stepwise approach to evaluating asymptomatic \nliver enzyme abnormalities. As was done with Ms. H, the first step \nis to stop alcohol and, if possible, potentially hepatotoxic medica-\ntions, and then remeasure the liver enzymes. Although aspects of \nthe history can increase the likelihood of a specific diagnosis, the \nhistory is not sensitive or specific enough to make a diagnosis, and \nit is necessary to test somewhat broadly. If liver enzyme abnor-\nmalities persist after stopping alcohol and potentially hepatotoxic \nmedications, the American Gastroenterological Association recom-\nmends beginning with a PT; serum albumin; CBC; hepatitis A, B, \nand C serologies; and iron studies (serum iron, total iron-binding \ncapacity [TIBC], ferritin). \n\nlgM and lgG ant l-HAV are both negative. HBsAg and lgM \nantl-HBc are negative; lgG ant l-HBc and antlHBs are pos-\nftive. Anti-HCV is negat ive. The transferrin saturation is \n35%, and the serum ferrltln is 1 90 ng/ml. \nHave you croeeed a diagnostic threshold \nfor the leading h;ypothssie, NAFLD1 Havs \nyou rulsd out ths actlvs attsrnatlvse1 Do \nothsr tests nud to bs dons to sxcluda ths \naltematlvs dlagnosee1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Hereditary \nHemochromatosis \nTextbook Presentation \nMost patients are asymptomatic, but a fehave extrahepatic man-\nifestations of iron overload. Some patients are identified by screen-\ning the family members of affected individuals. \nDisease Highlights \nA. An autosomal recessive disease causing deficiency of the iron \nregulatory hormone hepcidin, leading to increased intestinal \niron absorption and accumulation in tissues \nB. Iron deposition occurs throughout the reticuloendothelial sys \ntern, leading to a broad range of potential manifestations. \n1. Liver manifestations range from hepatomegaly to fibrosis to \ncirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma risk is increased only in \npatients with cirrhosis. \n2. Any joint can be affected, but the second and third \nmetacarpophalangeal joints are typical. \n3. Cardiac infiltration leads to cardiomyopathy. \n4. Other manifestations include secondary hypogonadism \n(pituitary infiltration), diabetes (pancreatic infiltration), \nand hypothyroidism (thyroid infiltration). \nC. There are several possible gene mutations; the most common is \nthe HFE C282Y mutation, thought to have initially occurred \nin a Viking or Celtic ancestor. \n\n1. In a meta-analysis of people of European ancestry with \niron overload, 81 % were homozygous for the HFE C282Y \nmutation. \n2. 5% were compound heterozygous for the C282Y/H630 \nmutation. \n3. In another study, nearly 100,000 primary care patients \nwere screened for iron overload and HFE mutations; \n299 homozygotes were found. \na. The prevalence ofhomozygosity was 0.44% in whites, \n0.11 % in Native Americans, 0.027% in Hispanics, \n0.014% in blacks, 0.012% in Pacific Islanders, and \n0.000039% in Asians. \nb. The prevalence ofheterozygosity for the mutation was \n10% in whites, 5.7% in Native Americans, 2.9% in \nHispanics, 2.3% in blacks, 2% in Pacific Islanders, and \n0.12% in Asians. \nD. The gene expression is quite variable, with the penetrance of \niron overload in homozygotes (abnormal transferrin saruration \nor ferritin) ranging from 38% to 76%; clinical disease is found \nin only 2-38% of men and 1-10% of women. \nE. 72% of patients with serum ferritin levds > 1000 mcg/L have \ncirrhosis, compared with 7.4% of those with ferritin levds \n< 1000 mcg/L. \nF. Screening primary care populations for hemochromatosis is \nnot recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force \nor the American College of Physicians. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Liver biopsy with measurement of hepatic iron index is the \ngold standard. \nB. Initial testing should be done with a transferrin saturation \n(serum iron/TIBC) and a serum ferritin (the test characteris-\ntics are for identifying homozygous patients). \n1. Transferrin saruration ~ 50% in men \na. Sensitivity, 82.4%; specificity, 92.5% \nb. LR+, 10.9; LR-, 0.19 \n2. Transferrin saruration ~ 45% in women \na. Sensitivity, 73.8%; specificity, 93.1 % \nb.

LR+, 11; LR-, 0.48 \nC. Patients who have a transferrin saturation~ 45% and an ele-\nvated ferritin should undergo HFE gene testing, looking for \nthe hereditary hemochromatosis mutations. \nAll first-degree relatives of patients with hered-\nitary hemochromatosis should undergo gene \ntesting, regardless of the results of the iron srudies. \n1. If C282Y/C282Y homozygous mutation is found \na. If age is< 40 years, ferritin < 1000 ng/mL, and \ntransaminases are normal, proceed to treatment. \nb. Otherwise, perform liver biopsy to determine severity. \n2. If other mutations or no mutations are found, look for other \ncauses of iron overload or perform liver biopsy for diagnosis. \nJAUNDICE AND ABNORMAL LIVER ENZYMES I 459 \nTreatment \nPeriodic phlebotomy to reduce the iron overload has been shown \nto reduce the risk of progression to cirrhosis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Autoimmune Hepatitis \nTextbook Presentation \nThe clinical presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic \ntransaminase devation to nonspecific constitutional symptoms, to \nadvanced liver disease. \nDisea5e Highlights \nA.

Other immunosuppressive agents are used in patients who do \nnot respond to or cannot tolerate the first-line treatments. \nE. Liver transplant is often successful in patients with cirrhosis \nand decompensated end-stage liver disease, although autoim-\nmune hepatitis can recur in the transplanted liver. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nMs. H's transaminase levels remained elevated after \nal75talni~ from alcohol and di5COntlnulng medications, \nmaking those etiologies unlikely. Her hepatitis A and C serol-\nogles are negative; her hepatitis 6 serologles are consis-\ntent with a previous Infection and not chronic hepatitis B. \nHer transferrln saturation Is normal, and the slightly ele-\nvated ferritin is not specific for any particular disease. You \norder an ANA. SMA. ceruloplasm in, and alpha-1 -a ntitrypsin \nlevels and phenotype. all of which are normal. \nAt this point, NAFLD Is lzy far the most likely diagnosis. \nAn ultrasound is not al75ol utely necessary, but it could con-\nfirm the presence of steatosls. \nMs. H has an ultrasound, which shows an enlarged liver \nwith diffuse fatty lnflltratlon. She begins to walk 20 min-\nutes 4 times/week, and reduces her portion sizes. Her tra n-\nsam lnases remain stable for the next several months. One \nyear later, she has lost 20 pounds, and her transaminases \nhave decreased to around 40. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nAcetaminophen-Induced Hepatotoxicity \nTextbook Presentation \nMost patients experience nausea, vomiting, malaise, and abdom-\ninal pain. While single overdose ingestion usually is a result of a \nsuicide attempt, up to half of cases occur accidentally. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen is 4 g/day; \nsome experts recommend < 2 g/day in patients with decom-\npensated cirrhosis or continued alcohol ingestion. \nB. In the United States, acetaminophen overdose was the leading \ncause for calls to Poison Control Centers and accounts for \n42% of acute liver f.tllure cases. \nC. Unintentional overdose, 48%; intentional overdose, 44%; \nremaining cases are unknown \n1. 38% ingested~ 2 acetaminophen preparations \nsimultaneously \n2. 63% used opioid-containing compounds \nD. Hepatotoxic effect is due to production ofN-acetyl-p-\nbenzoquinone imine (NAPQO \n1. NAPQI can be rapidly conjugated by hepatic glutathione \nto nontoxic metabolites. \n2. Once hepatic glutathione stores are depleted by 70-80%, \nNAPQI binds to hepatocytes causing cellular injury. \nL Chronic liver disease and chronic alcohol ingestion cause \ndepletion of hepatic glutathione, making acetaminophen \ntoxicity more likely in these patients. \nE. Toxicity is acute; transaminases typically increase 24-36 hours \nafter ingestion and peak at 72 hours. \nF. Maximal liver injury peaks 3-5 days after ingestion; jaundice, \ncoagulopathy, and encephalopathy can be present. \nG. Concurrent lactic acidosis is a poor prognostic marker. \n1. Early lactic acidosis due to inhibition of mitochondrial \nfunction by NAPQI \n2. Late lactic acidosis due to tissue hypoxia and decreased \nlactate clearance from acute liver f.tllure \nH. Screening for possible coingested substances and other causes \nof hepatitis should be considered, particularly if the history is \nuncertain. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. AST is often > ALT and can exceed 10,000 international \nunits/L. \nB. Precise time and amount of acetaminophen intake are critical \nfor diagnosis and management; a 4-hour acetaminophen level, \nor as soon after as possible, should be obtained. \nC. Time after ingestion and acetaminophen levels should be \nplotted on the Rumack-Matthenomogram which is used \nto guide whether administration ofN-acetylcysteine (NAC) \nshould be considered (Figure 26--6). \n7.73% \n22.22% \n45.07% \nNIA \n1-+-~~-+-~~-.-~~-.-~~+--~~-.--~~+-~---i \n4 \n12 \n20 \n28 \nHours After Ingestion \nFigure 26-6.

Cifu, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. K Is a 75-year-old woman who complains of a painful \nleft knee. \n~~ \nWhat le ~e differential diagnoele of joint \n~JI\"\" pain? Howould you frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe causes of joint pain range from common to rare and from \nbothersome to life-threatening. Even the most benign causes of \njoint pain can lead to serious disability. The evaluation of a patient \nwith joint pain calls for a detailed history and ph}'llical exam (often \nfocusing on extra-articular findings) and occasionally the anal}'llis \nof joint fluid, serologies, and radiologic tests. \nThe differential diagnosis of joint pain can be framed with the \nuse of 3 pivotal questions. First, is a single joint or are multiple \njoints involved (is the joint pain monoarticular or polyarticular)? \nIf the pain involves just 1 joint, the next question is, is the pain \nmonoarticular or extra-articular? Although this distinction may \nseem obvious, abnormalities of periarticular structures can mimic \narticu1ar disease. Finally, are the involved joints inflamed or not? \nFurther down the differential, the acuity of the pain may also be \nimportant. \nFigure 27-1 shows a useful algorithm organized according to \nthese pivotal points. Because periarticular joint pain is almost \nalwa}'ll monoarticular, the first pivotal point differentiates monoar-\nticular from polyarticular pain. Periarticular syndromes are dis-\ncussed briefly at the end of the chapter. \nThe differential diagnosis belois organized by these 3 pivotal \npoints as well. When considering both the algorithm and the differ-\nential diagnosis, recognize that all of the monoarticular arthritides \ncan present in a polyarticular distribution, and classically polyartic-\nu1ar diseases may occasionally only affect a single joint. Thus, this \norganization is useful to organize your thinking but should never \nbe used to exclude diagnoses from consideration. \nA. Monoarticular arthritis \n1.

These include septic arthritis, gout, and \npseudogout. Traumatic injury to the knee such as a meniscal injury \nor intra-articular fracture, although suggested by the history, are \nprobably less likely given the mild nature of the injury and the \ninflammation of the joint. \nSalient points of the patient's presentation are the rapid onset \nof the pain; the mild, antecedent trauma; and the lack of systemic \nsymptoms, such as fever, futigue, or weight loss. \nGout is the leading hypothesis given its high incidence, the \npatient's age, and the single inflamed joint. CPPD (sometimes \nreferred to as pseudogout) is common in the knee of elderly \npatients and is high in the differential diagnosis. An infectious \narthritis is probably less likely, given the sudden onset and lack \nof systemic symptoms, but it is a must not miss diagnosis since it \nwould be potentially disastrous if left untreated. Both gonococcal \nand nongonococcal septic arthritis are possibilities. Lyme disease \ncan affect multiple joints but most commonly causes a monoartic-\nular arthritis of the knee. Table 27-1 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nMrs. K has never had a similar episode before. Her ot her \nmedical problems include diabetes mellit us with diabetic \nnephropathy, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

The pain gener-\nally begins acutely and becomes unbearable within hours of onset. \nClassically, patients say that they are not even able to place a bed \nsheet over the toe. On physical exam, the first MTP joint is warm, \nswollen, and red. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis and most \ncommon crystal-induced arthropathy. \n\nTable 27-1.

Gouty attacks occur when sodium urate crystallizes in synovial \nfluid inducing an inflammatory response. \nC. The primary risk factor for gout is hyperuricemia. \nD. The prevalence of gout increases with age and is more common \nin men than women. \nE. Location \n1. The classic location for gout is the first MTP joint (podagra). \n2. The joints of the lower extremities and the dhows are also \ncommon sites (though usually after an initial attack of \npodagra). \nF. Gouty attacks often occur after abrupt changes in uric acid \nlevels. Common causes are: \nTable 27-2.

Alcohol binges \n3. Initiation of thiazide or loop diuretics \n4. Initiation of urate-lowering therapy \n5. Worsening kidney disease \nG. Gouty attacks can also be induced by trauma, illness, or \nsurgery. \nH. The initial attack nearly always involves a single joint, \nwhile later attacks may be polyarticular (sometimes in \ncontiguous joints). \nI. Forms of gout \n1. Acute gouty arthritis is by far the most common type of gout. \n2. Chronic arthritis can devdop in patients who have untreated \nhyperuricemia. \n3. Tophaceous gout occurs when there is macroscopic \ndeposition of sodium urate crystals in and around joints. \n4. The kidney can also be affected by gout. Sodium urate \nstones or a urate nephropathy can develop in patients. \nJ. Evaluation of a patient with gout \n1. Patients with a nediagnosis of gout should be evaluated \nfor alcoholism, chronic kidney disease, mydoproliferative \ndisorders, and hypertension. \n2. Patients in whom gout devdops before the age of thirty \nshould be evaluated for disorders of purine metabolism. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Acute, inflammatory, monoarticular arthritis is an absolute \nindication for arthrocentesis. \nB. Sampling synovial fluid will rule out potentially joint destroying \nseptic arthritis and usually make a diagnosis. \n~ \nEvery acute, inflammatory joint effusion \ny \nshould be aspirated. \nC. Arthrocentesis \n1. Joint fluid should be sent for cell count, Gram stain, culture, \nand crystal analysis. \n2. Normal joint fluid is small in volume and clear with a very \nlocell count. \n3. Characteristics of abnormal synovial fluid are shown in \nTable 27-2. These numbers should be used as estimates. \n4. Joint fluid obtained during an acute flare of a crystal \narthritis will be highly inflammatory in nature. \n5.

This may \nbe the case \na. When a patient has recurrent inflammatory flares \nsecondary to documented process (gout). \nb. When the diagnosis is clear (podagra for gout or \njoint trauma in a patient with a bleeding diathesis \nfor hemarthrosis). \nD. Clinical diagnosis \n1. Despite the crucial role of arthrocentesis in the diagnosis \nof acute monoarticular arthritis, the diagnosis of gout can \noccasionally be made with some certainty without joint \naspiration. \n2. The following clinical points make a diagnosis of gout \nprobable: \na. More than 1 attack of acure arthritis \nb. Maximal inflammation in < 1 day \nc. Monoarthritis \nd. Joint erythema \ne. First MTP involvement \nf. Unilateral MTP arthritis \ng. Unilateral tarsal acute arthritis \nh. Tophus \ni. Asymmetric joint swelling \nj. Hyperuricemia \nk.

Even in the setting of an acute inflammatory arthritis, \nan elevated serum uric acid(> 7 mg/dL) is only \nmoderately helpful: sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 54%; \nLR+, 2.0; LR-, 0.19 \n~ \n4, The presence of 6 findings highly consistent with gout rules \nin the diagnosis even without arthroccntesis. \nS.

Use of thiazide or loop diuretics \nc. Obesity \nd. Alcohol use \nTreatment \nA. Therapy for gout is classified as either abortive (to treat \nan acute flare) or prophylactic (to prevent flares and the \ndestructive effects on the joints and kidneys). \nB. Abortive therapy is outlined in Table 27-3. \n1. All of the therapies are effective and equally recommended \nin recent guidelines. The choice is usually made by the \npotential adverse effects. \n2.

There are S basic indications for prophylactic therapy: \na. Frequent attacks \nb. Disabling attacks \nc. Urate nephrolithiasis \nd. Urate nephropathy \nc. Tophaccous gout \n2. Although not supported by data, prophylactic therapy \ngenerally begins with nonpharmacologic interventions to \ndecrease uric acid levels. \na. Decrease intake of high purine foods (red meat, shellfish, \nyeast rich foods) \nb. Weight loss \nc. Discontinuation of medications that impair urate \nexcretion {eg, aspirin, thiazide diuretics). \n3. Potential prophylactic treatments are listed below. \na.

Allopurinol is usually the first antihyperuricemic drug \nused, although it is relatively contraindicated in patients \nwith chronic kidney disease or liver disease. \nb. Febuxostat is at least equally effective as allopurinol but \nis less cost-effective. \nc. Urate-lowering therapy does not reduce the risk of gout \nattacks for at least 6 months and there is no definitive \nevidence that treated patients have fewer flares than \nnontreated patients. \nd. If xanthine oxidase inhibitor therapy is ineffective, uric \nacid excretion should be measured. Patients with lo\nuric acid excretion (present in 80% of patients with \ngout) should be given a uricosuric agent. \n5. Colchicine should be used during the initiation of uratc-\nlowering therapy to prevent recurrent gouty flares. \na. NSAIDs may be added if necessary. \nb. Colchicine is usually continued for at least the first \n6 months {longer in the case of patients with tophi) \nof urate-lowering therapy. \n\nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nThe evaluation of this patient clearly requires joint aspiration. \nSeptic arthritis is in the differential of any acutely inflamed joint. \nMrs. K has 4 of the findings common for gout (maximal inflam-\nmation in < 1 day, monoarthritis, joint erythema, and asymmetric \njoint swelling), so although gout remains likely, especially given the \npresence of hypertension and her use of a thiazide, the diagnosis is \nnot certain. \n\nRadiO!:jraphs of the knee demonstrate evidence of mild OA \nbut no evidence of fracture. Joint fluid is aspirated from the \npatient's knee. \nHave you crose&I a diagnostic threshold for \nthe leading hyPOthesls, gout1 Have you ruled \nout the active alternatlvee1 Do other teete \nneed to be done to exclude the alternative \ndlagnosee1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Calcium Pyrophosphate \nDeposition Disease (CPPD) \nTextbook Presentation \nCPPD generally presents in older patients. It may present with \nan acute flare (pseudogout) or, more commonly, as a degenerative \narthritis with suspicious radiographic findings that distinguish it \nfrom OA. Patients often have other diseases associated with CPPD, \nsuch as hyperparathyroidism. \nDisease Highlights \nA. CPPD is a crystal-induced arthropathy that can present in the \nfollowing ways: \n1. Often asymptomatic: diagnosed as an incidental radiographic \nfinding of chondocalcinosis, the linear calcifications of \narticular cartilage \n2. Pseudogout \na. An acute, inflammatory, usually monoarticular arthritis \nb. Can be clinically indistinguishable from gout \n3. CPPD arthropathy \na. A chronic arthritis that is clinically similar to OA \n(sometimes referred to pseudo OA) \nb. May affect joints less commonly affected by OA like the \nwrists, MCPs, and shoulders \n4. A chronic, inflammatory polyarthritis resembling RA \na. Sometimes referred to as pseudo RA \nb. Seen in small percentage of patients with CPPD (-5%) \n5. Pseudoneuropathic arthropathy (rarely) \na. Resembles a Charcot joint \nb. Destructive monoarthropathy is seen in this presentation. \nB. There are many other similarities between pseudogout \nand gout. \n1. Both are caused by the inflammatory response to crystals in \nthe synovial space. \n2. Both cause acute painful monoarticular attacks. \n3. Both can cause polyarticular flares. \n4. Flares can be induced by trauma or illness. \nJOINT PAIN I 461 \n5. Both can potentially cause destructive arthropathy. \n6. Incidence increases with age. \nC. There are some aspects of the disease quite distinct from gout. \n1. Episodic \"gout-like\" flares only occur in a small percentage \nof patients. \n2. As above, CPPD commonly manifests as a degenerative \narthritis (in about 50% of patients). \n3. It has highly specific radiologic features. \n4. It most commonly affects the knee. \nAlthough CPPD is commonly thought of as \npseudogout, it more commonly presents as a \nchronic degenerative arthritis. \nD. Pseudogour has been associated with a number of diseases, \nthe most common of which are: \n1. Hyperparathyroidism \n2. Hemochromatosis \n3. Hypomagnesemia \n4. Hypophosphatasia \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Definite diagnosis of CPPD arthritis requires demonstration \nof the calcium pyrophosphate crystals in synovial fluid. \nB. Certain radiographic findings are quite suggestive. The \nclassic findings are punctate and linear calcific densities, \nmost commonly seen in the cartilage of the knees, hip, \npelvis, and wrist. \nC. The following characteristics should make a clinician consider \nthe diagnosis of CPPD: \n1. Acute arthritis of a large joint, especially the knee, in the \nabsence of hyperuricemia. \n2. Chronic arthritis with acute flares. \n3. Chronic arthritis involving joints that would be atypical for \nOA such as the wrists, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, \nand shoulders. \nD. Evaluation of a patient with pseudogour should include \ntesting for related diseases. The evaluation generally includes \nmeasuring the levels of the following: \n1. Calcium \n2. Magnesium \n3. Phosphorus \n4. Iron, ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) \n5. In the right setting, markers of other rheumatologic \ndiseases (uric acid, rheumatoid factor [RF], anti-cyclic \ncitrullinated peptide [anti-CCP]) \nTreatment \nA. Treat any associated underlying disease that is present. \nB. Acute attacks can be managed with: \n1. NSAIDs \n2. Joint aspiration with corticosteroid injection \n3. Cokhicine \nC. Chronic degenerative arthritis is difficult to treat. NSAIDs are \nusually used. \n\n468 I CHAPTER 27 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Septic Arthritis \nTextbook Presentation \nSeptic arthritis usually presents as subacute joint pain associated \nwith low-grade fever and progressive pain and disability. Because \nthe infection is usually caused by hematogenous spread, a risk \nfactor for bacteremia (such as injection drug use) is sometimes \npresent. Disseminated gonorrhea is discussed separately below. \nDisease Higblights \nA. Septic arthritis usually occurs via hematogenous spread \nof bacteria. \nB. Joint distribution \nI. The knee is the most commonly affected joint. \n2. Monoarticular arthritis is the rule, with multiple joints \ninvolved in < 15% of patients. \n3. Infection is most common in previously abnormal joints, \nsuch as those affected by OA or RA. \nC. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism followed \nby species of streptococcus. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Clinical findings \nI. Fever is present in most patients. \na. One meta-analysis found that 57% of patients with \nseptic arthritis had fever. \nb. Recognize that this means that over 40% of patients \nwith septic arthritis are afebrile. \nc. Fever > 39 .0C is rare. \n2. Findings predictive of a septic arthritis causing joint pain \nare recent joint surgery (LR+ 6.9) and the presence of a \nprosthetic knee or hip in the presence of a skin infection \n(LR+ 15.0). \nFever cannot distinguish septic arthritis from \nother forms of monoarticular arthritis. Patients \nwith gout may be febrile while those with \nseptic joints may not be. \nB. Laboratory findings \n1. WBC > 10,000/mcL is seen in only 50% of patients. \n2. Definitive diagnosis is made by Gram stain and culture. \na. The Gram stain of synovial fluid is positive in about \n75% of patients with septic arthritis. \nb. The Gram stain is most likely to be positive \nwhen the infecting organism is S aureus; it is less \nlikely to be positive when another organism is the \ninfecting agent. \n3. Elevated synovial fluid WBC count is predictive. \na. Synovial fluid WBC count> 100,000/mcL: LR+ 28; \nLR- 0.71. \nb. Lower WBC cut offs are nondiagnostic. \n4. Joint fluid culture is positive in about 90% of cases. \nS. Blood (and sputum, when appropriate) should also be \ncultured \na. May help identify an organism if one is not isolated \nfrom the synovium \nb. About 50% of patients will have positive blood cultures. \nTreatment \nBecause of the potential for septic arthritis \nto cause joint destruction, a single, acutely \ninflamed joint should be assumed infected \nuntil proved otherwise. \nA. Antibiotic therapy is directed by Gram stain findings. \nB. Empiric therapy should cover S aureus. \nC. The affected joint should also be drained, either with a \nneedle, arthroscope, or arthrotomy (opening the joint in \nthe operating room). \n1. Small joints can usually be drained and lavaged with serial \narthrocentesis. \n2. Large joints usually require surgical drainage. \n3. The knee is an exception, a large joint that, in many cases \ncan be treated with serial arthrocentesis. \nD. Patients who receive treatment within 5 days of symptom \nonset have the best prognosis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Disseminated Gonorrhea \nTextbook Presentation \nDisseminated gonorrhea is classically seen in young, sexually active \nwomen who have fever and joint pain. The most common presen-\ntation is severe pain of the wtists, hands, and knees with warmth \nand erythema diffusely over the backs of the hands. A rash may \nsometimes be present. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Disseminated gonorrhea is a disease with rheumatologic \nmanifestations that is seen in young, sexually active persons. \nB. Women are 3 times more likely to have the disease than men. \nDisseminated gonorrhea usually occurs in \npatients without a history of a recent sexually \ntransmitted infection. \nC. Disseminated gonorrhea presents in 1 of2 ways (with a good \ndeal of overlap): a classic septic arthritis or a triad of tenosyno-\nvitis, dermatitis, and arthralgia. \n1. The triad presentation reflects a high-grade bacteremia with \nreactive features. \n2. The tenosynovitis presents predominantly as a \npolyarthralgia of the hands and wtists. \n3. The rash is a scattered, papular, or vesicular rash. \n4. The more classic, monoarticular septic joint presentation \noccurs in about 40% of patients. \nS. Table 27-4 gives the frequency of various findings in these \n2 types of presentation. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosis is based on isolating the organism. \nB. Besides synovial fluid cultures, blood cultures, pharyngeal \ncultures, and PCR testing of urine or genital swabs should \nbe sent. \nC. If all cultures are negative, the disease can still be diagnosed \nif there is a high clinical suspicion and a rapid response to \nappropriate antibiotics. \n\nTable 27-4.

Ceftriaxone 1 g IV or IM every 24 hours or cefotaxime I g IV \nevery 8 hours. \nB. IV therapy is generally recommended for 24--48 hours after \nimprovement. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Lyme Disease \nTextbook Presentation \nLyme disease presents in different ways at different stages of the \ndisease. A classic presentation of the joint symptoms is a patient \nwith acute, inflammatory knee pain who has been in an area where \nthe disease is endemic. There may be a history of a previous tick \nbite, rash, or nonspeciAc febrile illness. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrtlia burgdorftri, \ntransmitted by a number of species of Ixodes ticks. \nB. The tick most commonly transmits the disease during its \nnymphal stage. \nC. In the United States, the range of the lxodes tick has spread to \ninclude the entire east coast, the south to as far west as central \nTexas, much of the Midwest (Michigan, Northern Illinois, \nWisconsin, Minnesota}, and the west coast. \nD. The clinical picture varies somewhat between the United States \nand Europe and Asia. The presentation in the United States is \ndiscussed bdow. \nE. Peale incidence is in June and July, with disease occurring from \nMarch through October. \nF. Transmission from a tick that has been discovered and removed \nis very low. \n1. Transmission from infected nymphal ticks generally occurs \nonly after 36-48 hours of attachment (longer for adult ticks). \n2. In I study, no erythema migrans devdoped from any tick \nbite in which the tick was removed in < 72 hours. \nG. Lyme disease is generally divided into 3 stages: \nJOINT PAIN I 469 \n1. Early locali7.ed disease \na. Skin findings arc most common, usually a large area of \nlocalized erythema. \n(1) 80% of patients have an acute rash. \n(2) 50% of the rashes occur bdothe waist. \n(3) The mean diameter of the rash is 10 cm. \n(4) About 60% of the rashes are an area of \nhomogeneous erythema. \n(5) About 30% of rashes arc the more classic target \nlesion. \n(6) About 10% of the patients have multiple lesions. \n~ \nOnly about 30% of patients with Lyme disease \ny \nhave the classic target rash on presentation. \nb. Other symptoms include \n(1) Myalgias and arthralgias (59%) \n(2) Fever (31%) \n(3) Headache (28%) \n2. Early disseminated disease (weeks to a couple of months \nafter the bite) usually involves the central nervous system \n(CNS) and the heart. \na. CNS disease is more common than cardiac and includes \nheadache, facial nerve palsy, lymphocytic meningitis, \nand radiculopathy. \nb. Cardiac disease generally involves conduction \nabnormalities (heart block). \n3. Joint symptoms predominate late in the disease. \na. Occur in about 60% of uncreated patients beginning \nabout 6 months after infection. \nb. Monoarticular knee arthritis is the most common \nAnding. \nc. Intermittent attacks or an oligoarticular arthritis may \nalso occur. \nd. A very small proportion of patients go on to have \na chronic syndrome dominated by subjective \ncomplaints. \nEvidence-Based. Diagno.sis \nA. DeAnitive diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on clinical \ncharacteristics, exposure history, and antibody titcrs. \nB. Antibodies are insensitive early in the disease and are thus not \nhdpful in the setting of acute infection. \nC. Antibodies are nearly 100% sensitive in the setting of arthritis. \nTreatment \nA. There are multiple antibiotic regimens effective in the treatment \nof localized and disseminated Lyme disease. \nB. Prophylactic treatment with a single dose of doxycycline given \nafter a tick bite is effective at preventing Lyme disease but is \ngenerally not recommended given the lolikelihood of being \ninfected with Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite, even in \nendemic areas. \nC. Treatment of arthritis caused by Lyme disease consists of 4 wcdcs \nof oral antibiotics. \nD. Chronic symptoms that develop after appropriate treatment of \nLyme disease do not respond to intensive antibiotic therapy. \n\n470 I CHAPTER 27 \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. K's synovial fluid aspiration yielded 25 ml of trans-\nlucent, yellofluid. The WBC was about 55,000/mcl with \n56% PMNs. The Gram stain was negative, and crystal exam \nwith polarized light microscopy demonstrates negatively \nbirefringent crystals consistent with monosodium urate \ncrystals, thus making the diagnosis of gout. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT W \nMrs. C Is a 50-year-old woman who comes to your office \ncomplaining of joint pain. She reports the pain has been \npresent for about 2 years. The pain affects her hands and \nher wrists. She describes the pain as a dull aching\" and \n\"a stiffness. it is worst In the morning and Improves over \n2-3 hours. She says that on particularly bad days she \nuses NSAIDs with moderate relief. \nA\"t; thie poin\"t;, wha\"t; ie \"t;he leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altematlves, and is \nthere a must not mles dfagnoels7 Given this \ndifferential dlagnoeie, what teete ehoukJ be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAlthough morning stiffness is common with many types of arthri-\ntis, Mrs. C's prolonged symptoms are suggestive of an inflamma-\ntory arthritis. She does not seem to have other systemic symptoms, \nand she has no history of a recent infection. At this point, pivotal \nfeatures are the polyarticular and inflammatory nature of the joint \npain and the chronicity of the symptoms. \nConsidering these points, as wdl as the fact that the patient is a \nmiddle-aged woman, RA has to lead the differential. The chronic-\nity, age at onset, and joint distribution all support this diagnosis. \nPsoriatic arthritis can be indistinguishable from RA, especially \nearly in its course, and needs to be considered. SLE can also present \nas a chronic, inflammatory arthritis. The patient is older than the \naverage age of onset for SLE, and we have not heard about other \norgan system involvement. \nDegenerative arthropathies, such as OA and CPPD, should be \nconsidered, but the joint distribution and inflammatory nature of \nthe arthritis makes these less likely. Table 27-S lists the differential \ndiagnosis. \n\nMrs. C ls otherwise well, except for a history of mlld hyPer-\ntenslon managed with an anglotensln-receptor blocker. She \nreports no other Joint pains. She does not have a history of \npsoriasis. \nThe inflammatory joint fluid is consistent with the exam. Acute \ngout is commonly associated with very inflamed joints, often with \nvery high WBC counts. The positive crystal exam makes the diag.-\nnosis of gout. \nThe patient was treated with NSAIDs and colchicine with a \ngood response. Because this was Mrs. K's first attack, prophylactic \ntherapy was not instituted. \nTable 27-5.

Swollen and \ntender wrists, MCP, and proximal intcrphalangcal (PIP) joints arc \nusually seen on cum. Lahowory evaluation may rcvcal an anc:mia \nof inflammation and positive RF and anti-citrullinatcd protein anti-\nbody (ACPA. sometime& called anti-CCP). \nI>Uease Highlights \nA. RA is the paradigm. for idiopathic inflammatory arthritides. \nB. The sine qua non of RA is the pn:se.nce of an inflammatory \nsynovitis, most commonly involving the h2nds. This synovitis \neventually forms a desttuctive pannthat injures articular \nand periarticular tissue. \nC. RA is corrunon and debilitating. \n1. The prevalence of RA is about 1%. \n2. As many of 28% of patients stop working with.in a year \nof diagnosis. \n.......... RA should be considered in any adult with \nY \na chronic, synunetrk polyarthritis. \nD. Common 6ndin~ in RA arc: \n1. Symmetric arthritis of the hands \n2, Presence of serum RF and ACPA \n3. Presence of radiographic changes typical of RA on hand and \nwrist radiographs. \n4. Prolonged moroing stiffness (> 30-60 minutes) is a classic \nSndiog in those with inflammatory arthritis. \n~...... Prolonged morning stiffness is a clue to an \n.,.,... inflammatory arthritis. \nE. The joints most commonly involved. are \n1. Hand \na. Wrists, MCP. and PJP joints an: most commonly a1fec:a:d. \nb. Distal interphaJangcal (DIP) joints arc often spared. \nc. Ulnar deviation of the MCPs as well as swan neck and \nboutonnicre deformities are classic findings. \nd. Figure 27-2 shows a hand with some of the classic \n6ndiogs of RA. \n2. Elbo\n3. Knee \n4.

Once RA is established, joint destruction begins to occur \nand can be seen on radiographs. The chronic synovitis causes \nerosions of bone and cartilage. \nG. I..ong\"'5tandiog RA can cause severe joint deformity through \ndestruction of the joint and injury to the periarticular structures. \nH. Nooarticular findings in RA \n1. Rheumatoid nodules, when pre&ent. are usually over \nextensor surfaces. \n2. Dry eyes are conunoo. \n3. Pulmonary nodule& or interstitial lung disease \n4. Pcricudial disease \na. Asymptomatic pericardial effusion is most common. \nb. RJ:strictive pericuditis can occur. \nS. Anemia of inflammation (see Chapter 6) is a typical Sndiog \nin RA. \n.Evidenc:e-Buecl Diagnoaia \nA. The diagnosis of RA can be difficult because it may resemble \nother causes of inflammatory arthritis around the time of onset. \nB. Morning stiffuess is a not a useful diagoostic test for RA. Test \ncharacteristics for morning stiffiless > 30 minutes: \n1, Sensitivity, 74-77%; specificity, 48-52% \n2. LR+, 1.4-t.6; LR-, 0.~.44. \nC. Serologies \n1. RF is a nonspecmc test. \na. It is occasionally positive in healthy people and in a \nnumber of inflammatory states sw:b as infections, \nsarcoid0&is, and periodootal diseaae. \n\n472 I CHAPTER 27 \nb. The test characteristics of RF vary in different studies \nbut a meta-analysis found the following: sensitivity, \n69%; specificity, 85%; LR+, 4.86; LR-, 0.38. \n2. ACPA is a newer test that is more predictive of RA than RF. \nThe same meta-analysis found the following: sensitivity, \n62%; specificity, 95%; LR+, 12.46; LR-, 0.36. \n~ \nA positive ACPA is very predictive of a diagnosis \ny \nofRA. \n3. In practice, RF and ACPA are used together. Patients are at \nhigh risk for RA when these tests are positive. \nD. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has developed \ndiagnostic criteria for RA (Table 27-6). \n1. These criteria are meant to be used in patients who have \nclinical synovitis of at least 1 joint not explained by another \ndisease. \n2. A score of ;i: 6/ 10 fulfills the criteria. \n3. Although meant to standardize research and not to be used \nas diagnostic criteria, they are helpful in highlighting the \nclinical characteristics of RA. \n4. The test characteristics of the ACR criteria vary depending \non when in the course of the illness they are evaluated and \nthe end point used for the diagnosis of RA. Representative \nsensitivities and specificities: 62-84% and 60-78%, \nrespectively. \n~E. Other very specific findings are the presence of rheumatoid \nnodules (LR+ > 30) and consistent radiographic changes \n(LR+ 11). \nTable 27-6. 2010 American College of Rheumatology/ \nEuropean League Against Rheumatism Classification \nCriteria for RA. \nCategory \nCriteria \nScore \nJoint Involvement \n1 large joint \n---------\n2-1 O large joints \n---------\n1-3 small Joints \n---------\n4-1 O small joints \n---------\n> 1 O joints (small or large) \n------------------\n---------\nSerology \nNegative RF and negative \nACPA \n-------- \nLow-positive RF or \nlow-positive ACPA \n---------\nHigh-positive RF or \nhigh-positive ACPA \n------------------\n---------\nAcute Phase Reactants \nNormal CRP and normal ESR \n---------\nAbnormal CRP or abnormal \nESR \n------------------\n---------\nDuration of symptoms \n<6weeks \n---------\n~6weeks \nRF, rheumatoid factor; ACPA. anti-citrullinated protein antibody; ESR. erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate; CRP, (-reactive protein. \nTreatment \nA. The treatment for RA is really the purvieof the \nrheumatologist. \nB. Early, aggressive therapy is thought to markedly improve \nlong-term outcomes. \nC. The treatments are often divided into those that treat the \nsymptoms of the disease and those that modify the course \nof the disease. \nD. The drugs used to treat the symptoms of the disease are: \n1. NSAIDs \na. Generally used early in the course of the disease for \nsymptom relief while a diagnosis is being made. \nb. Rarely, patients with very mild disease can remain on \nthese medications alone. \n2. Corticosteroids \na. Generally provide excellent symptom control but due to \nsignificant long-term side effects are used in the lowest \ndose and for the least time possible. \nb. Their effect on slowing joint destruction from RA is \ncontroversial. \nE. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) \n1. Traditional DMARDs include \na. Hydroxychloroquine \nb. Methotrexate \nc. Leflunomide \nd. Sulfualazine \n2. Biologic DMARDs include \na. Etanercept \nb. lnfliximab \nc. Abatacept \nd. Rituximab \n3. The newest DMARD tofacitinib is a drug that inhibits \ncytokine and growth factor signaling through interference \nwith Janus kinases. \n4. A common course of therapy would begin with low-\ndose prednisone and methotrexate. In patients not \nadequately controlled, the next step is would be the \naddition ofhydroxychloroquine or biologic, such as \netanercept. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nThe presentation of Mrs. C's symptoms is typical for RA. She \nalready fulfills 4 of the ACR criteria for RA. Further evaluation \nshould be directed toward gathering other information that might \nsuggest RA and make other diagnoses less likdy. \n\nA CBC with Iron 5tudle5, RF. ACPA, and antinuclear ant l-\nbodie5 (ANA) are done. Radiograph5 are ordered wtth fine \ndetails of the hands. \nHave you crossed a diagnostic threshold for \nthe leading h;ypothesis, RA1 Have you ruled \nout the actl\\1111 altarnatl\\lllls1 Do other tae'te \nnlll&i to be done to exclude the altarnatl\\1111 \ndlagno5111s1 \n\nAlternative Diagnosis: Psoriatic Arthritis \nTextbook Presentation \nPsoriatic arthritis most commonly presents as joint pain in middle-\naged patients with a history of psoriasis. There are signs and symp-\ntoms of an inflammatory arthritis often involving the wrists, MCP, \nPIP, and DIP joints. Exam of the skin reveals psoriasis and psoriatic \nnail changes. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Psoriasis is a very common skin disease that can be complicated \nby arthritis. \nB. Psoriatic arthritis is one of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. \n1. The seronegative spondyloarthropathies are diseases \ncharacterired by inflammatory axial spine involvement, \nasymmetric peripheral arthritis, enthesopathy; and \ninflammatory eye diseases. \n2. Patients with these diseases classically have a negative ANA \nand RF, giving the group the \"seronegative\" moniker. \n3. Other seronegative spondyloarthropathies are ankylosing \nspondylitis, reactive arthritis, and the arthritis associated \nwith inflammatory bowel disease. \nC. The distribution of the arthritis in psoriatic arthritis is variable \nbut follows 3 general presentations: \n1. Oligoarthritis often involving large joints and the hands. \nDactylitis, a swelling of the entire finger causing a \"sausage \ndigit\" secondary to both arthritis and tenosynovitis, is a \nclassic finding. \n2. A polyarthritis similar to RA \n3. A spinal arthritis \nD. Psoriatic arthritis can be indistinguishable from RA, especially \nearly in the course of both diseases. \n1. Radiographs of the hands can shoerosions. \n2. About 10% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have a \npositive RF. \nE. Distinguishing features include: \n1. Common involvement of DIP joints \n2. Spine involvement that is uncommon in RA \n3. Arthritis mutilans, a syndrome in which there is marked \nhoney destruction around joints causing \"telescoping digits.\" \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The most diagnostic feature of psoriatic arthritis is the presence \nof psoriasis. \n1. Psoriasis precedes the development of arthritis in about \n70% of cases. \n2. Arthritis and psoriasis begin contemporaneously in about \n15% of patients. \n3. 15% of patients do not have psoriasis {at the time of their \narthritis diagnosis) although there may be a family history \nof the skin disease. \nB. A very careful skin exam should be done in all patients in \nwhom the diagnosis is suspected. \nC. Nail findings \n1. Psoriasis can cause recognizable changes in the nails \n(pitted, \"oil stained\" nails). \n2. Nail changes occur in only about 20% of people with psoriasis \nbut in about 80% of people with psoriasis and arthritis. \nJOINT PAIN I 473 \n3. Nail changes are especially common in people with DIP \narthritis. \nA detailed skin and nail exam is important \nwhen considering the diagnosis of psoriatic \narthritis. Nail polish should be removed for \nthe visit. \nTreatment \nThe treatment of psoriatic arthritis is similar to the treatment \nof RA. \nAlternative Diagnosis: SLE \nTextbook Presentation \nSLE classically presents in a young woman with fatigue and arthri-\ntis, commonly of the hands. There are often suspicious findings in \nthe history such as an episode of pleuritis or undiagnosed anemia. \nDisease Highlights \nA. SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting \nwomen of childbearing age. \nB. Various groups are more prone to disease. \n1. Female:male ratio is about 9:1. \n2. About 5% of patients report a first-degree relative with the \ndisease. \n3. Women of color are most commonly affected. \nC. Almost every organ can be involved, although the joints, skin, \nserosa, and kidneys are most commonly affected. \nD. The pathogenesis of the disease is related to the formation of \nautoantibodies to a number of nuclear antigens. The ANA is \nthe most common. \nE. The most common features of SLE, both at presentation and \nlater in follow-up, are listed in Table 27-7. \nTable 27-7.

The diagnosis of SLE, especially in people with mild disease, \ncan be difficult. \nB. The ACR has developed criteria to standatdize the diagnosis \nfor research purposes. \n1. The criteria are: \na. Malar rash \nb. Discoid rash \nc. Photosensitivity \nd. Oral ulcers \ne. Arthritis (nonerosive arthritis) \nf. Serositis (pleuritis or pericarditis) \ng. Kidney disorder (proteinuria or cellular casts) \nh. Neurologic disorder (headache, seizures, or psychosis \nwithout other cause) \ni. Hematologic disorder (hernolytic anernia or any cytopenia) \nj. Immunologic disorder (anti-ds-DNA, anti-SM, or \nantiphospholipid antibodies) \nk. Positive ANA \n2. The diagnosis of SLE requires the presence of 4 or more of \nthese criteria. \n3. Although the same reservations about using diagnostic \ncriteria clinically that were discussed above in the section \non RA apply here, the SLE criteria are frequently used. \nC. Newer diagnostic criteria have also been developed by the \nS}'llternic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) \ngroup. \n1. These criteria, referenced at the end of the chapter, give \nsomewhat greater primacy to serologic and pathologic \nevidence of SLE. \n2. A patient may fulflll the criteria with biopsy-proven \nSLE nephritis and the presence of ANA or anti-ds-DNA \nantibodies. \nD. The test characteristics for the diagnostic criteria are given in \nTable 27-8. Also included in this table are the test characteris-\ntics for the various individual criteria. \nE. Satisfaction of the ACR criteria or the presence of the anti-Sm \nantibody is highly supportive of the diagnosis of SLE. Failure \nto fulflll the SLICC criteria or the absence of ANA argue \nstrongly against SLE. \nF. Autoantibodies \n1. Measuring autoantibodies in SLE provides important \ndiagnostic information. \n2. ANA and anti-ds-DNA \na. ANA is the most sensitive test for SLE. It is nonspecific. \nb. Anti-ds-DNA and anti-Sm are highly specific. They are \nalso associated with the presence of lupus nephritis. \nc. ANA does not vary with disease activity while \nanti-ds-DNA does. \nA negative ANA essentially rules out SLE. A \npositive anti-ds-DNA or anti-Sm essentially \nrules in SLE. \nd. Staining patterns are often reported with the ANA. \n(1) These patterns correlate, to some extent, with the \nother specific antibodies discussed bdoand their \nuse has, to a great extent, been supplanted by \nthese tests. \nTable 27-8.

Other serologies are hdpful because they tend to be associated \nwith various subsets of disease. \na. Anti-RNP: Associated with Raynaud phenomenon and \nmyositis and highly sensitive for mixed connective tissue \ndisease. \nb. Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La: Associated with Sjogren \nsyndrome and photosensitivity \nc. Anti-ribosomal P: Highly specific for SLE \n4, Table 27-9 outlines a variety of serologies that may be obtained \nin persons in whom rheumatologic disease is suspected. \nG. Complement \n1. Complement levels are helpful in tracking the activity of \nSLE but ate nonspecific. \n2. C3, C4, and CH50 levels tend to decline during episodes \nof lupus activity. \nTreatment \nA. Similar to RA, the treatment of SLE is complicated and the \npurvieof the rheumatologist. \nB. In general, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants \nare the mainsta}'ll of therapy. \nC. NSAIDs are generally used for symptomatic rdief of inflam-\nmatory symptoms with careful monitoring because of their \npotential nephrotoxic effects. \n\nTable 27-9.

She \nreports bel ng well until 2 days ago when she awoke with pain \nIn both knees and mild pain In both wrists. No other Joints \nwere Involved. She also noted a nonpruritic rash on her dis-\ntal arms and legs. She describes the rash as \"splotchy.\" \nThe joint pain has worsened over the last 2 days, and she \nreports that both her knees are swollen. \n~ \nAt thle point, what le the leading hypothHle, \n,~r what are the active altematlvH, ant.I I!! \nthere a must not mlH diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnoeie, what teete &hould be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMs. T has acute onset polyarticular joint symptoms. From her \nhistory of knee swelling, it is likely that she has arthritis rather \nthan arthralgia. The pivotal points are acute onset and polyar-\nticular involvement. Considering these points, and limiting the \ndifferential diagnosis based on the patient's demographics and \nJOINT PAIN I 475 \nD. Cortkosteroids and hydroxychloroquine are commonly used \nin long-term therapy and high-dose corticosteroids are used \nfor disease exacerbations. \nE. Cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofctil, and azathioprine \nare the most commonly used immunosuppressants in SLE. \nThey are used most widely for the treatment of lupus nephritis. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. C's laboratory and radlol09.Y test result s are as fol-\nlows: Hb, 10.5 g/dl; HCT, 31 .0%; serum ferrltln, 95 ng/ml \n(nl > 45 ng/ml); serum Iron, 36 mC{;l/dl (nl 40-160 mC{;j/dl); \nTlBC. 200 mcg/dl (nl 230-430 mcg/dl ); RF. 253 inter-\nnational unit s/ml (nl < 1 0 intemat ional units/ml ); anti-\nCCP 1 OOO units/ml (nl < 100 units/ml) ANA. 2560 t iter \n(nl < 00); antl-ds-DNA. < 10 tlter (nl < 10); radlographs of \nhand, perlartlcular erosions of the 3 cllnlcally Involved MCP \njoints. \nThe diagnosis of RA is nofairly certain. The clinical picture, as \nwell as the laboratory tests showing an anemia of chronic inflam-\nmation, elevated RF and anti-CCP, and positive ANA, all sup-\nport the diagnosis. {About 40% of patients with RA have positive \nANAs.) While the first step in management is to control Mrs. C's \nsymptoms {NSAIDs and prednisone are likely to accomplish \nthis), she should be referred immediately to a rheumatologist so \nDMARD therapy can be initiated. There are already signs of joint \ndestruction on the radiographs. \nassociated symptoms, we are able to come up with a fairly short list \nof probable etiologies. \nGiven the acuity of the illness, infectious arthritides need to \nbe strongly considered. Many viral illnesses can cause arthritis. \nParvovirus is probably the most common. Bacterial illnesses can \ncause polyarthritis in myriad ways. Septic arthritides, discussed \nabove, can be polyanicular as can disseminated gonorrhea. Bac-\nterial endocarditis can cause aseptic polyarthritis and can cause \narthralgias. Acute rheumatic fever classically causes a migratory \npolyarthritis and rash. Lyme disease, discussed above, is most com-\nmonly monoarticular but can present in a polyarticular fashion. \nReactive arthritis, occurring after enteric or urogenital infections, \nis also a possibility. \nAlthough less likely, given the acute onset, primary rheuma-\ntologic diseases must also be considered. In a young woman with \narthritis and a rash, SLE needs to be included on the differential \ndiagnosis. As discussed above, rash, arthralgias, and arthritis are \namong the most common presenting symptoms in patients with \nSLE. In addition to the acuity of the onset, the lack of other \norgan system involvement would be a little unusual for patients \nwith SLE. RA would be less likely given the patient's age; how-\never, Still disease, a variant of RA, may present acutely in young \npatients. \nGiven that the viral arthritides are more common than bacte-\nrial ones and, as far as we know, the patient has been previously \nwell, viral arthritis is probably more likely than bacterial disease. \nTable 27-10 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\n476 I CHAPTER 27 \nTable27-10.

There were no other symptoms. \nShe reports no travel outside Chicago, where she is a col-\nlege Junior, for the last year. She reports no known exposure to \nticks and admits that she Is seldom outside of the city. She \ndoes not use recreational drugs. She Is not sexually active. \nOn physical exam, she appears healthy. Her vita! signs \nare temperature, 36.9C; BP, 106/68 mm Hg; pulse, \n84 bpm; RR. 14 breaths per minute. On extremity exam, her \nwrists have normal range of motion but there is pain with \nextremes aF flexlon and extension in the wrists and MCPs. \nThere Is mildly decreased range of motion and warmth in the \nknees as well as small effusions. \nSkin exam reveals a diffuse erythematous rash with \nmacules on the hands, feet, and distal extremities. Palms \nand soles are spared. The remainder of the exam is normal. \nThere is no heart murmur. \nThe patient's history supports our initial hypothesis. The his-\ntory of a recent febrile illness makes a viral or other postinfectious \narthritis most likely. Lyme disease and bacterial endocarditis are \nvery unlikely given her lack of suspicious exposure and the fact that \nshe is otherwise presently well. SLE remains on the differential but \nis less likely. \n~ \nIn a patient with acute polyarthritis, a detailed \n,,... history of recent iJlnesses must be taken. \nle the clinical Information sufficient to make a \ndiagnosl91 If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Parvovirus \nTatbook Presentation \nParvovirus is commonly seen in young people who are in contact \nwith children {mothers, teachers, daycare workers, and pediatri-\ncians). Symptomatic parvovirus may present with a flu-like illness, \nmacular rash, arthralgias/arthritis, or any combination of these \nsymptoms. Joint symptoms generally improve over the course of \nweeks. \nDisease Highlights \nA There are 5 major manifestations of parvovirus infection in \nhumans. \n1. Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children \n2. Acute arthropathy in adults \n3. Transient aplastic crises in patients with chronic hemolytic \ndiseases \n4. Chronic anemia in immunocompromised persons \n5. Fetal death complicating maternal infection prior to \n20 weeks gestation. \nB. In adults, infection usually includes some combination of viral \nsymptoms, arthritis, and rash. \n1. Nonspecific viral symptoms are seen in about half of \ninfected patients and include fever, malaise, headache, \nmyalgia, diarrhea, and pruritus. \n2. Arthropathy accompanies about 30% of adult infections. \na. The arthritis is a symmetric polyarthritis. \nb. Commonly involved joints are elbows, wrists, knees, \nankles, feet. \n3. The rash is seen in about 35% of people and lasts 2-3 days. \na. It is usually a peripheral macular rash that occasionally \nspreads to the trunk. \nb. Many different rashes have been described. \nC. The incidence of parvovirus infection peaks between January \nand June. \nD. Attack rates are 50-60%. \nE. Contact with children is common among patients. \nF. Other viruses cause arthritis less commonly {Table 27-11). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA The diagnosis of parvovirus is made by identifying parvovirus \nspecific lgM in the serum of patients with a suspicious \nsymptom complex. \nB. The differential diagnosis of parvovirus includes SLE and \nthe differentiation of these diseases can be challenging. \n1. Both may present with arthritis, arthralgias, and rash. \n2. Both are more common in women than men. \n3. ANA can be transiently elevated in patients with \nparvovirus. \n\nTable 27-11. Other viral causes of arthritis.1 \nVirus \nRubella \nHepatitis B \nHIV \nDisease Characteristics \nSeen In about 50% of Infections \nOccurs occasionally with vaccination \nAssociated with rash \n------------------\nArthritis usually precedes jaundice but Is \nassociated with transamlnltls \nRash may be present \n----------------- \nMay be symptom of seroconversion \n'Mumps, arbovlruses, adenovlruses, coxsacklevlruses, and echovlruses are all associated \nwith arthritis. \nTreatment \nA. The treatment of parvovirus is symptomatic. \nB. NSAIDs generally provide good relief of symptoms. \nC. Symptoms usually resolve within a couple of weeks, but as \nmany as 10% of patients have symptoms that last longer. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMs. T was treated with NSAIDs and given a retum appoint-\nment In 1 week. Laboratory tests were performed and \nrevealed the following: basic metabollc panel, normal; liver \nblochemlcal tests, normal; WBC, 6800/mcl; Hb, 12.9 g/dl; \nHGT, 37.9%; platelet, 182,000/mcl; ESR, 68 mm/h; rapid \nstrep test, negative. HIV test, ANA. streptococca I antibody \ntiters, blood cultures, and parvovirus titer were pending \nwhen she left her first appointment. \nHave you c:roseed a diagnostic: threshold for \nthe leading hY}'OthHie, parvovirue? Have \nyou ruled out the ac:tlve alternatives? Do \nother tests need to be done to exc:lude the \nalternatlve dlagnosee? \nParvovirus, or another viral arthritis, is highest on the differen-\ntial diagnosis. Laboratory testing to rule in the most likdy disease \nand rule out other possible diseases is essential. The normal liver \nbiochemical tests rule out hepatitis B as the cause of the patient's \nsymptoms. Negative blood cultures will make endocarditis even \nless likely than it is based on the history alone. Lyme disease was \nthought so unlikely that serologies were not sent. Stool cultures \nwere sent to evaluate the possibility of a reactive arthritis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Reactive Arthritis \nTatbook Presentation \nReactive arthritis classically presents as a subacute, oligoarticular \narthritis, often involving the knees, ankles, and back. Physical \nexam reveals arthritis. There may be a history of an antecedent \ninfection and symptoms of urethritis and conjunctivitis. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Reactive arthritis is an acute arthritis complicating enteric and \nurogenital infections. \nJOINT PAIN I 477 \nB. Manifestations of the disease begin 1-4 weeks after the \ninciting infection, but more often than not, the inciting \ninfection is asymptomatic. \n~ \nReactive arthritis often presents without an \ny \napparent antecedent infection. \nC. Reactive arthritis is one of the seronegative spondyloar-\nthropathies and thus shares features with other diseases in \nthis class. \n1. The arthritis is typically an asymmetric oligoarthritis, \nusually involving the large joints of the lower extremities. \na. Knees, ankles, and joints in the feet are the most \ncommon locations. \nb. Dactylitis, hed pain, and back pain also occur in \n50-60% of patients. \n2. Presence of the HLA B-27 antigen predicts more severe \narthritis and more protracted disease. \nD. The presentation of reactive arthritis often includes extra-\narticular manifestations such as enthesitis, tendinitis, bursitis, \nurethritis, or conjunctivitis. \n1. Urethritis is &equently the first finding followed by eye \nfindings and then arthritis. \n2. Other associated findings include rash, nail changes, and \noral ulcers. \n3. Table 27-12 shows the prevalence of various findings from \nan early study. \nE. The bacteria commonly implicated in reactive arthritis are \n1. Shige/la \n2. Salmonella \n3. Yersinia \n4. C4mpylobaaer \n5. Chlamydia \nF. The incidence of reactive arthritis varies by organism. \n1. Studies of outbreaks of gastrointestinal infections have \nprovided incidences of 0-29%. \n2. Population-based studies, performed on people who had \npositive stool culrures for an enteric pathogen, have yidded \nincidence on the order of 1-3 cases/100,000. \nTable 27-12.

Gastrointestinal infections are equally likely to be the inciting \nevent in men and women. Arthritis compllcating chlamydial \ninfection is rare in women. \nH. The age at diagnosis is generally in the 30s. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis is a cllnical one. \nB. Although there are no agreed upon diagnostic criteria, proposed \nones have included major criteria (asymmetric monoarticular or \noligoarticular arthritis of the lower extremities and a preceding \nenteric or urogenital infection) and minor criteria (evidence \nof a triggering infection or persistent evidence of synovial \ninflammation). \nC. A high clinical suspicion is warranted in a young patient with \nan inflammatory, asymmetric oligoarthritis. \nTreatment \nA. In most patients, symptoms resolve within 1 year. \nB. NSAIDs are useful in treating the acute symptoms. \nC. Culture-positive enteric or chlamydial infections should \nbe treated. \nD. A subset of patients experience relapse, development of a \nchronic arthritis, or development of ankylosing spondylitis. \nE. There has been some recent suggestion that patients with a \nchronic arthritis, negative traditional cultures, but evidence of \npersistent chlamydial infection (positive synovial fluid or blood \npolymerase chain reaction [PCR]) be treated with antibiotics. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Rheumatic Fever \nTextbook Presentation \nRheumatic fever classically presents in a child in the weeks following \nstreptococcal pharyngitis. The 5 cardinal manifestations are arthri-\ntis, carditis, rash, subcutaneous nodules, and chorea. The arthritis is \ntypically migratory, involving the knees, ankles, and hands. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that follows \nstreptococcal pharyngitis by 2-4 weeks. \nB. Unlike in children, cllnical documentation of a previous strep-\ntococcal infection is rare in adults and the most pronounced \nsymptoms are joint pain and stiffness. \nC. The arthritis is classically a migratory polyarthritis. \n1. Individual joints are usually affected for less than a week. \n2. The joints in the legs are usually affected first. \n3. Subjective complaints are often more prominent than \nobjective findings. \nD. Carditis \n1. May involve any, or all, parts of the heart-pericarditis, \nmyocarditis, endocarditis, or pancarditis. \nTable 27-13. Jones criteria for the rheumatic fever. \nMajor Criteria \nMinor Criteria \nPolyarthritis \nFever \nCarditis (pericarditis, myocarditis, \nArthralgia \nendocarditis) \nChorea \nRash-Erythema marginatum, \nsubcutaneous nodules \nInflammatory markers (eg, CRP, ESR) \nPR segment prolongation \nCAP. (-reactive protein; ESR. erythrocyte sedimentation rate. \n2. Endocarditis commonly causes valvular lesions that may \nprogress over years to symptomatic valve disease, especially \nmitral stenosis. \nEvidence-Based Diagnos.U \nA. The diagnosis of rheumatic fever is based on the Jones Criteria. \nB. The criteria require evidence of an antecedent group A strep-\ntococcal infection (culture, antibody titer) with either 2 major \ncriteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria (Table 27-13). \nTreatment \nA. Anti-inflammatories \n1. Aspirin is the mainstay of therapy. \n2. Corticosteroids are given to patients with severe carditis. \nB. Antibiotics \n1. Penicillin for eradication of streptococcal infection. \n2. Lifelong prophylactic therapy with penicillin is usually \nrecommended after the initial therapy. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nParvovirus clearly fits this patient's presentation. Reactive arthritis \nis possible although the patient has not had a gastrointestinal or \nurogenital infection. Rheumatic fever seems less llkely. Although \nshe does have multiple Jones criteria (polyarthritis, arthralgia, ele-\nvated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and although the lack \nof a sore throat during the recent illness is not terribly helpful, the \npatient does not have a migratory arthritis or evidence of present \nsueptococcal carriage. \n\nMs. T's final test results included negative streptococcal \nantibody titers and blood cultures. Her ANA was posit ive \n(titer 1 :80) as was her parvovirus lgM. She was t reated \nwith NSAIDs wit h good relief of her symptoms. Her rash \nresolved over 3-4 days, and j oint pain was gone at a \nfollow-up visit 2 weeks later. \n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. L is a 55-year-old man who comes to see you com-\nplaining of right hip pain. He reports suffering with the pain \nfor about 2 years. The pain Is worst In the morning and \nevening. In the morning, It Is associated with stiffness. \nThe stiffness lasts about 5 minutes and then Improves. \nAt the end of the day he routinely feels a dull ache that \nis worse if he has had a very active day. He recently noticed \nthat he is unable to cross his legs (right over left) without \ndiscomfort. \nAt thle point, what le the ludlng hYPtJtheele, \nwhat al'fJ the active altsmatlves, and Is \nthel'fJ a muet not miH dlagno9le1 Given thle \ndlffel'fJntlal diagnosis, what tests &hould be \nordel'fld? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. L is a middle-aged man with chronic, monoanicular symptoms. \nThe time course, single joint involvement and noninflammatory \nnature of the process (we have not heard about warmth, erythema, \nor prolonged morning stiffness) are the pivotal points in this case. \nReviewing the initial differential diagnosis, the articular process \nthat best firs the history is OA, a chronic, noninflarnmatory, often \nmonoarticular arthritis. OA is so common in older adults that it \nbecomes the diagnosis to disprove in all patients who have pain \nat all consistent with OA The disease most commonly affects the \nfingers, knees, hips, and spine. CPPD, as was discussed previously, \nis another chronic degenerative arthritis that could produce similar \nsymptoms and should be considered. \nIn patients with noninflarnmatory monoarticular symptoms, \nwe also have to consider the specific periarticular symptoms that \ncan affect the particular joint. \nWhen considering the periarticular syndromes that cause \nhip pain, it is important to identify where exactly the patient feels \nthe pain. Lumbar spine disease with radicular symptoms can cause \npain in the buttocks or lateral hip. Trochanteric bursitis is a com-\nmon cause of lateral hip pain. Inguinal hernias may cause groin \npain. Femoral stress fractures may cause groin or lateral hip pain. \nAlthough such stress fractures are rare and are most commonly \nseen in young women, they should not be missed. Use ofbisphos-\nphonates or corticosteroids should raise the possibility of other \ncauses of hip abnormalities, femoral shaft fractures and osteone-\ncrosis, respectively. Table 27-14 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\n\"Hip pain\" is a nonspeciflc complaint. It is \nimportant to identify the exact location of the \npain. \nWhen asked to pinpoint the location of his pain, Mr. L reports \nthat he primarily feels it in the groin. Rest, ibuprofen, and \nheat all seem to help the pain. He comes in today b'ecause \nhe Is in more constant pain, and he has begun to limp on bad \ndays. His past history Is remarkable only for mild asthma. \nHe denies any previous Injury to the hip. He has never b'een \nhospitalized or taken corticosteroids. His only medication \nis albuterol. \nJOINT PAIN I 479 \nTable 27-14.

There is decreased ranqe of motion in hip \nrotation with about 10 degrees in intemal rotation and \n20 degrees In extemal rotation. \n~ \nls the cllnlcal information sufficient to make a \n1~r dlagnoel91 If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: OA \nTc:nbook Presentation \nOA most commonly presents in older patients as chronic joint \npain and stiffness. Pain is usually worse with activity and improves \nwith rest. Knees, hips, and hands are most commonly affected. On \nexamination of the joints, there is bony enlargement without sig-\nnificant effusions. Mild tenderness may be present along the joint \nlines. There is limited range of motion. Radiographs are diagnostic. \nDisease Highlights \nA. OA is a disease of aging, with peak prevalence in the eighth \ndecade. However, as obesity is a risk factor, it may be seen in \nmuch younger people with severe obesity. \n\n480 I CHAPTER 27 \nB. More common in women than men \nC. Although often referred to as \"wear and teat\" arthritis, the \npathophysiology is actually quite compllcated. \nD. Joint destruction manifests as a loss of cartilage with change \nto the underlying bone seen as bony sclerosis and osteophyte \nformation. \nE. Joint disttibution \n1. OA is most common in the knees, hips, hands, and spine. \n2. Nearly any joint can be affected. \n3. Non-weight-bearing joints other than the hand, such as \nthe dbow, wrist, and shoulder, are les5 commonly affected \nby OA. The ankle is also not a conunon location. \nF. Classic symptoms include \n1. Pain with activity \n2. Relief with rest \n3. Periarticular tenderness \n4. Occasional mildly inflammatory flares \n5. Gelling: Joint stiffness brought on by rest and rapidly \nresolving with activity. \n6. Late in the disease, constant pain with joint deformation \nand severe disability is common. \nG. Physical exam findings \n1. In general, there is bony enlargement, crepitus, and \ndecreased range of motion without signs of inSammation \nor synovial thidren.ing. \n2. Knee \na. Crepitus \nb. Tenderness on joint line \nc. Varus or valgus displacement of the lower leg related to \nasymmetric loss of the articular cartilage. \n3. Hip \na. Marked decrease first in internal and then external \nrotation \nb. Groin pain with rotation of the hip \n4. Hand \na. Tenderness and bony enlargement of the f'ust \ncarpometacarpal joint \nb. Joint involvement in decreasing order of prcwlence is \nDIP, PIP, MCP.. \nc:. Heberden nodes (prominent osteophyu:s of the \nDIP joints) \nd. Bouclwd. nodes (prominent ostcophytcs of the \nPIP joints) \nc. Figw:c 27-3 shows a hand with some of the classic \nSndings of OA. \n5. Spine \na. Signs of spinal OA vary depending on location. \nb. Pain and limited range of motion arc common. \nc. Radicular symptoms resulting from ostcophyte \nimpingement on nerve roots is seen. \nd. Spinal stcnosis with associated symptoms (radiculopathy \nand pscudodaud.icarion) can n:sult from bony hypertrophy \n(sec Chapter 7. Back Pain). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of OA is clinical, based on a compatible history, \nphysical exam, and radiologic findings. \nFigure 273. Osteoarthritis of the hand. \nB. Because of the high prevalence of OA, the diagnosis should \nlead the differential in any patient with suspicious symptoms. \nC. Diagnostic criteria have been established. \nl. Hand \na. Pain, aching, or stiffness \nb. Three of the following \n(1) Hard tissue enlargement of at least 2 of the \nfollowing joints: \n() Second and third DIP joints \n(b) Second and third PJP joints \n(c) First MCP joint \n(2) Hard tissue enlargement of 2 or more DIP joints \n(3) Fewer than 3 swollen MCP joints \n(4) Deformity of at least 1 of the joints listed in above \nentries a through c. \n2. Hip \na. Hippain \nb. Two of the following: \n(1) ESR < 20 mm/h \n(2) Ostcophytes on radiograph \n(3) Joint-space narrowing on radiograph \n3.

Nonpharmacologic \n1. Patient education and improved social support have \nbeen shown to improve pain and improve the efficacy of \npharmacologic interventions. \n2. Weight loss decreases the symptoms of lower extremity OA. \n3. Ph~ical and occupational therapy can help patients with \nfunctional impairment due to OA. \nB. Pharmacologic \n1. There is a remarkable amount of controversy regarding \nthe most effective therapies for OA. The controversy stems \nfrom the lack. of high-quality, comparative, long-term trials \nof therapies. \n2. Acetaminophen \na. Frequently used as initial therapy given its loside-\neffect profile. \nb. Recent data has questioned its efficacy. \n3. NSAIDs are probably more effective than acetaminophen \nfor severe OA. \n4. Oral combinations of glucosamine and chondroitan sulfate \nprobably are modestly effective in some patients and have a \nvery favorable side-effect profile. \n5. Intra-articular medications \na. Intra-articular corticosteroids are very effective for pain \nrelief in acute flares of OA. \nb. Hyaluronic acid given by intra-articular injection may \nprovide a small benefit to some patients. \n6. Tramadol and opioid analgesics are reasonable choices for \npatients with severe symptoms. \nC. Surgical \n1. Arthroscopic surgery for OA is probably ineffective. \n2. Hip and knee replacement can have remarkable effects \non decreasing pain and improving function in patients in \nwhom conservative therapy has failed. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. I:s history and ph~ical exam are very suggestive of OA, but \nCPPD remains a possibility. Most of the periarticular syndromes \nthat were considered initially have been made unlikely by the \nexam. Lumbar spine disease with radicular symptoms would not \ncause the limited range of motion that is seen on the patient's \nexam. The predominant symptom in patients with trochanteric \nbursitis is tenderness over the bursa. Mr. L does not have a hernia \non exam. Femoral stress fractures may cause groin pain but should \nnot really cause limited range of motion. That said, this is a diag-\nnosis that must not be missed, so further consideration should \nbe given. \nThe working diagnosis of OA was made and the patient was \ngiven 1 OOO mg of acetaminophen twice daily. A radiogra ph \nwas ordered. \nHave you crossed a diagnostic thl'flshold for \nthe ladlng hYPothHle, OA'i Have you ruled \nout the active alternatlves'i Do other tests \nneed to be done to e><clude the altematlve \ndlagnoeee'i \nAlternative Diagnosis: Femoral Stress Fradures \nTextbook Presentation \nFemoral stress fractures are most commonly seen in young female \nathletes. Symptoms begin acutdy with groin pain that persists and \nworsens as the day progresses. On physical exam, there is often \nmild tenderness over the proximal one~third of the femur. Range \nof motion of the hip is normal. Radiographs are usually normal. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Like other types of stress fractures, femoral stress fractures are \nmost common in: \n1. Athletes who have recently increased their level of training \n2. Women \n3. Persons with decreased bone density \nB. The most common stress fractures are tibial and metatarsal. \nC. Femoral stress fractures usually present with hip or groin pain \nwith preserved range of motion of the hip. \nEvidence--Based Diagnosis \nA. Stre~ fractures in general and femoral stre~ fractures in \nparticular are often not seen on initial radiographs. \nB. MRI and bone scans are considered the diagnostic test of choice. \nTreatment \nA. Many stre~ fractures heal with reduced physical activity and \nshorMerm immobilization. \nB. Femoral stress fractures may resolve with decreased weight \nbearing (crutches) or may require casting or internal fixation. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nThe patient 's hip radiograph showed changes consistent \nwith OA. \nThe combinat ion of a high clinical suspicion. pain. and \nconsistent findings on a radlograph confirms the diagnosis. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nPeriarticular Syndromes \nThere are textbooks written about the numerous periarticular syn-\ndromes that commonly present to primary care physicians, ortho-\npedists, and rheumatologists.

Ho\n~JI\" would ;you frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAKI is a broad clinical syndrome defined by an abrupt decrease in \nkidney function over a period of hours to days, characterized by a \nrise in serum creatinine or a decrease in urinary output. The time \nframe of development and persistence of kidney damage defines a \nspectrum that extends to acute kidney disease (AKD) and chronic \nkidney disease (CKD). Table 28-1 summatizes the current diag-\nnostic criteria and staging for AKI, AKD, and CKD, which may be \nrelevant in the evaluation and prognostication of disease. \nThe framework for the differential diagnosis of AKI is a com-\nbination of anatomic and pathophysiologic, typically divided into \nprerenal, intra.renal, and postrenal causes: \nA. Prerenal (due to renal hypoperfusion) \n1. Intravascular volume depletion \na. Gastrointestinal loss \nb. Renal loss: drug-induced or osmotic diuresis (such as from \nhyperglycemia), diabetes insipidus \nc. Skin and mucous membrane losses \nd. Hemorrhage \ne. Third spacing, such as nephrotic syndrome, pancreatitis, \netc. \n2. Decreased effective circulating volume (with or without \nhypo tension) \na. Heatt failure (HF), with or without catdiogenic shock \nb. Cirrhosis \nc. Pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism \n3. Systemic or renal vasodilation \na. Sepsis \nb. Cirrhosis \nc. Anaphylaxis \nd. Anesthesia- and medication-induced \n4. Impaired renal autoregulation \na. Medication-induced, such as nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs}, angiotensin-converting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers \nb. Renal attery thrombosis or embolism \nc. Abdominal aortic aneurysm \ncl Hepatorenal syndrome \nB. Intrarenal \n1. Tubular injury (acute tubular necrosis [ATN]) \na. Ischemic, due to prolonged renal hypoperfusion \nb. Toxin induced \n(1) Medications, such as aminoglycosides, cisplatin, etc. \n(2) Contrast-induced AKI \n(3) Rhabdomyolysis (myoglobin) or massive hemolysis \n(hemoglobin) \n(4) Paraproteinemias, such as myeloma kidney \n2. Interstitial \na. Acute interstitial nephritis \n(1) Medications \n(2) Infections \n(3) Systemic diseases, such as sarcoidosis, systemic lupus \nerythematosus (SLE), lymphoma \nb. Bilateral pyelonephritis \n3. Glomerular \na. Nephritic syndromes \n(1) Immune-mediated: postinfectious glomerulonephritis \n(GN), IgA nephropathy, SLE, endocarditis \n(2) Vasculitis: pauci-immune crescentic GN, microscopic \npolyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis \n(3) Goodpasture syndrome \nb. Nephrotic syndromes rarely cause AKI {see Chapter 17, \nEdema for a discussion of nephrotic syndrome) \n4. Vascular \na. Large- or medium-sized vessels \n(1) Renal artery thrombosis or embolism \n(2) Renal vein thrombosis \n(3) Atheroembolism \nb. Small vessels \n(1) Thrombotic microangiopathics: hemolytic uremic \nsyndrome (HUS)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic \npurpura (TIP) \n(2) Malignant hypertension \n(3) GN or vasculitis \nC. Postrenal \n1.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n1. Best overall measure of kidney function \n2. Best estimated using inulin clearance, but this is rardy done \nin practice \nB. Serum creatinine \n1. Level varies with age, sex, race or ethnic group, muscle mass, \ndiet, nutritional status \n2. The relationship berween creatinine and GFR varies inversdy \nand exponentially, so that early, small changes in serum \ncreatinine may reflect clinically signiflcant decreases in GFR \na. A 50-year-old white man with a baseline serum creatinine \nofl.O mg/dLhas aGFRof80 mUmin/1.73 m 2; if his \ncreatinine increases by 50% to 1.5 mg/dL, his GFR drops \nto 50 mUmin/1.73 m2 \nb. If his basdine serum creatinine is 4.0 mg/dL, his \nGFR is about 16 mL/min/1.73 m2; if his creatinine \nincreases by 50% to 6.0 mg/dL, his GFR is about \n10 mL/min/1.73 m2 \n3. An increase in creatinine, without a change in GFR, may \nbe seen due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine \nby certain drugs, eg, trimethoprim, cimetidine, and \npyrimethamine (pseudo-AKI). \nC.

Given this \ndifferential dlagnosl5, what te5t5 should l:>e \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAlthough 1 etiology may be more likely than \nthe others based on the presentation, the initial \ntesting is generally the same for every patient \nwith AKI. \nThe pivotal point in this patient's presentation is the hypoten-\nsion, due to hypovolemia, sepsis (with pneumonia a likely source), \nor both. Concurrent use of a diuretic and angiotensin-converting \nenzyme inhibitor may compound the hyporension and failure \nof renal autoregulation. Transient hypovolemia or hypotension \ncauses prerenal azotemia, but prolonged hypotension such as his \nmay lead to renal ischemia and ATN. His history of CKD (base-\nline creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL), age, and hypertension increase his \nrisk of developing ATN whenever renal blood flois reduced. \nNevertheless, it is necessary to make sure he does not also have \na component of prerenal AKI due to volume depletion. Finally, \ndespite his normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) a femonths \nago, he could have obstruction from BPH or recurrent prostate \ncancer. Post-streptococcal GN, an intrarenal cause of AKI, is not a \nconsideration since that occurs after group A hemolytic streptococ-\ncal infections, which are not common pathogens in pneumonia. \nTable 28-2 lists the differential diagnosis. \nBecause hypovolemia and obstruction are such \ntreatable causes of AKI, they are alwayi; \"must \nnot miss\" diagnoses. \nTable 28-2.

Etiology \n1. Ischemia due to renal hypoperfusion prolonged enough to \ncause tubular cell damage \na. Patients with normal kidneys and normal renal arteries \nmaintain normal renal blood floand GFR with mean \narterial pressures (MAPs) as loas 80 mm Hg, via \nautoregulatory mechanisms. \nb. As renal arterial pressure decreases, afferent arterioles \nvasodilate due to renal prostaglandins, whereas \nefferent arterioles vasoconstrkt via angiotensin II \neffects, thus, maintaining glomerular capillary pressure \nandGFR. \nc. If renal artery pressure drops belothe autoregulatory \nrange, endogenous vasoconstrictors increase afferent \narteriolar resistance, leading to reduced glomerular \ncapillary pressure and GFR \nd. If lorenal perfusion persists, prolonged ischemia leads \nto tubular injury and cell death. \ne. Patients with the conditions or exposures listed in \nTable 28-3, all of which impair autoregulation, are at \nhigher risk for developing ATN. \n2.

The Mehran Risk Score fur contrast-induced AKI \nafter coronary angiography can be calculated online \nat https:// qxmd.com/ calculate/ calculator_ 47 / \ncontrast-nephropathy~post~pci \nB. Epidemiology and prognosis of ATN \nI. ATN accounts for 55-60% of AKI in hospitalized patients \nand for 11 % in outpatients. \n2. Postoperative ATN and contrast-induced AKI are the most \ncommon causes. \n3. Can be oliguric (urinary output< 400 mL/day} or \nnonoliguric. \n4. Mortality in hospitalized patients with ATN is 15-30%; \nin ICU patients, mortality is abour 40-60%. \n5. Risk factors for increased mortality include \na. Male sex \nb. Advanced age \nc. Comorbid illness \nd. Malignancy \ne. Oliguria \n Sepsis \ng. Mechanical ventilation \nh. Multiorgan failure \ni. Severity of illness \n6. 60% of patients who survive recover kidney function over \n1-2 weeks; a \"post ATN diuresis,\" during which urinary \noutput transiently increases, may be seen. \n7. CKD is more likely to develop in patients with normal \nkidn~ who have recovered &om ATN; those with \npreexisting CKD are more likely to need future dialysis. \n\n490 I CHAPTER 28 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nUrine electrolytes, urinalysis, and serum BUN \nand creatinine are used to distinguish ATN \nfrom prerenal states; ulttasonography is used to \ndistinguish ATN from obstruction. \nA. Urine chemistries \n1. Prior to ischemic damage, hypoperfusion causes increased \nreabsorption of sodium, water, and urea by the tubules \na. If prolonged, ischemia leads to tubular damage \nb. Then, tubules can no longer increase reabsorption, \nleading to urinary sodium and urea loss. \n2. Urinary sodium measurements may be impacted by \ndiuretics, which causes natriuresis. \n3, Urea reabsorption is less affected by loop and thiazide \ndiuretics than urine sodium. \n4. In the absence of diuretics, there should be relatively little \nsodium and urea in the urine in prerenal AKI, as opposed \ntoATN. \n5. Fractional excretion of sodium (F~) and fractional \nexcretion of urea (FE ) are often used to distinguish \nprerenal AKI from ATN: \nurine Na x plasma creatlnlne \nFE,., \nplasma Na x urine crealinine \nurine urea nitrogen x plasma craatinine \nFE,.. = blood urea nitrogen x urine creelinine \n6. The studies looking at the test characteristics of these \ncalculations are limited by small numbers of patients, \ninconsistent definitions of the gold standard by which the \ncause of AKI was determined, and lack of generalizability. \na. The sensitivity of FE \n< 35-40% to detect prerenal \nAKI ranges from 68%'i:o 98%, with specificities ranging \nfrom 48% to 98%. \nb. The sensitivity of F~ < 1 % to detect prerenal AKI \nranges from 58% to 96%, with specificities ranging \nfrom 75% to 95%. \nc. Some studies shothat FE \nis more sensitive than \nF~. in patients taking diur7rlcs. \n7. Table 28-4 lists situations in which the F~. result is the \nopposite of expected. \nTable28-4.

Urine microscopy \n1. Granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells are classic \nfindings in ATN. \n2. In 1 study, no patients with prerenal AKI had > 10 granular \ncasts/hpf or > 6 renal tubular epithelial cells/hp \na. Zero granular casts/hpfhas an LR+ of 4.35 for the \ndiagnosis of prerenal AKI. \nb. 6--10 granular casts/hpf has an LR+ of 9.68 for the \ndiagnosis of ATN; > 10 granular casts/hpf is 100% \nspecific for ATN. \n3. Hematuria suggests intrarenal or structural kidney disease \nand is not seen in prerenal AKI or ATN. \nC. Other findings \n1. Specific gravity > 1.020 and urine osmolality > 500 mOsm/kg \nare associated with prerenal states. \na. Osmolality can be falsely loin prerenal states because \nof impairment of concentrating ability from underlying \nCKD, an osmotic diuresis, use of diuretics, or diabetes \ninsipidus. \nb. Sensitivity and specificity of these findings are unknown. \n2. The BUN/creatinine ratio is classically> 20:1 in prerenal \nstates due to reabsorption of urea with sodium. \na. Can also be elevated with gastrointestinal bleeding, \nuse of corticosteroids, intake of a high~protein diet, or \nincreased catabolism (postoperative or infection} \nb. Can be loin AKI secondary to rhabdomyolysis, or \nwhen urea production is decreased due to malnutrition \nor advanced liver disease. \nD. Physical exam \n1. See Chapter 31, Syncope, for a discussion of measuring \northostatic vital signs and their usefulness in assessing acute \nblood loss. \n2. The ability of the physical exam to diagnosis hypovolemia \nis not well studied. Available data show: \na. Orthostatic vital signs: pulse increment > 30 bpm \nand systolic BP decline > 20 mm Hg have moderate \nspecificity (75% for pulse, 81 % for BP) but poor \nsensitivity (43% for pulse, 29% for BP}; LR+ and \nLR- are both ~ 1. \nb. Dry axilla (LR+, 2.8), dry mucous membranes of \nthe mouth and nose (LR+, 3.1}, and abnormal skin \nturgor in the subclavicular area (LR+, 3.5) are the best \npredictors of hypovolemia. \nc. The absence of abnormal skin turgor in the \nsubclavicular area and the absence of longitudinal \nfurrows on the tongue reduce the likelihood of \nhypovolemia (LR-, 0.3 for both findings). \nd. One study suggests that a combination of fmdings (eg, \nconfusion, nonfluent speech, dry mucous membranes, \ndry/furrowed tongue, extremity weakness, and sunken \neyes} is highly predictive of hypovolemia. \nTreatment \nPatients can be hypovolemic in the absence of \nexpected physical exam findings. \nA. Discontinue nephrotoxic agents. \nB. Adjust doses of drugs for kidney impairment as necessary. \n\nC. Ensure adequate volume status and perfusion pressure (MAP) \n1. MAP = 113 systolic BP + 2/3 diastolic BP \n2. General MAP goal is <!: 65 mm Hg in sepsis; elderly \npatients may need MAP > 80-90 mm Hg. \nD. Obtain nephrology consultation within 48 hours. \nE. Optimize nutritional support. \nF. No evidence to support the use ofloop diuretics, such as furo-\nsemide, or low-dose dopamine; both may actually be harmful. \nG. Indications for acute dial)75is \n1. Hyperkalemia \n2. Volume overload \n3. Metabolic acidosis refractory to medical therapy \n4. Uremic pericarditis or encephalopathy \nH. Prevention of contrast-induced AKI \n1. Identify patients at risk for contrast-induced AKI {see above). \n2. Consider alternative imaging procedures. \n3. Discontinue NSAIDs 1 day before and for 2-4 da}'5 \nfollowing the procedure; hold metformin the day of the \nprocedure and for 2 da}'5 afterward to prevent metformin-\ninduced lactic acidosis if contrast-induced AKI develops. \n4. Optimize volume status prior to the procedure; there are \ngood data to support the use ofIV hydration in high-risk \npatients. \na. Guidelines recommend \n(1) For inpatients: 1 mUkg/hour for 12 hours prior to \nand 12 hours following the procedure \n(2) For outpatients and urgent procedures: 3 mUkgl \nhour for 1 hour prior to and 1-1.5 mUkg/hour \nfollowing the procedure \nb. Saline should be used for hydration; there is no evidence \nto support the use of sodium bicarbonate instead of saline. \nS. There was no benefit with administration ofN-acetylcysteine \nas prophylaxis against contrast-induced AKI. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr. rs FEN. is 2.41 %, and his FE.,.... is 53%. He Is treated \nwith IV antibiotics and fluids, with normalization of his \nBP. A repeat creatinine, done several hours later. is again \n3.8mg/dL. \nHave you crosNd a diagnostic thnsshold for \nths lading hypothHle, ATN1 Havs you rulll!td \nout ths actlvs alternatlvss1 Do othsr tll!tsts \nnell!td to bs done to e><clude ths alternatlve \ndiagnoeee1 \nThe combination of sepsis, a FEw:ea > 50%, the finding of granular \ncasts, lack of exposure to other toxins, and lack of response to \nIV fluids makes hypotension-induced ATN the most likely diagno-\nsis, with prcrcnal azotemia unlikely. The normal amount of urine \nthat was noted upon indwelling urinary catheterization argues \nagainst the presence of obstruction at the level of the urethra or \nbladder neck. However, it is not possible to rule out obstruction at \nthe level of the kidnC}'5 and ureters based on the information avail-\nable so fur, so it is necessary to obtain a renal ultrasound. (AKI due \nto obstruction will be discussed later in the chapter.) \n\nKIDNEY INJURY, ACUTE I 491 \nExclude urinary tract obstruction in patients \nwith AKI who have risk factors including older \nmale, history of abdominal or pelvic malig-\nnancies, nephrolithiasis, spinal cord pathology, \nanticholinergic medications and symptoms \nof anuria, dribbling and incontinence; or \nin patients whose kidney function does not \npromptly improve. \nPatients who are not anuric can still have \nobstruction causing AKI. \nThe renal ultrasound shows normal kidneys. with no hydro-\nnephrosis. On the day of discharge.Mr. T's BP remains stable \nand the serum creatinine has decreased to 2.0 mg/GIL. The \nlndwelll119 urinary catheter Is removed, but 3 hours later. \nhe has not voided. A bladder scan shows 500 ml of urine. \nMr. T has developed acute urinary retention, a common complica-\ntion in hospitalized older men, particularly those with BPH. \nRelated Diagnoses: Acute Urinary Retention \nand BPH \n1. Acute Urinary Retention \nAcute urinary retention is most commonly seen in older men \nwith prostatic hypertrophy causing bladder neck obstruction \n(seen in 10% of men in their 70s and up to 33% of men in their \n80s). The risk is increased for older men, for those with moderate \nto severe lower urinary tract symptoms, for those with a florate \n< 12 mL/sec, and for those with a prostate volume > 30 mL by \ntransrectal ultrasound. \nIn women, acute urinary retention is usually due to neurogenic \nbladder, and in younger patients, it is usually due to neurologic \ndiseases such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. Medications \nthat commonly induce urinary retention in susceptible patients \ninclude antihistamines, anticholinergics, antispasmodics, tricyclic \nantidepressants, opioids, and alpha-adrenergic agonists. \n2.BPH \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is an older man with urinary frequency, \nnocturia, reduced stream, and dribbling at the end of urination. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Defined as microscopic (histologic evidence of cellular prolif-\neration), macroscopic (actual enlargement of the prostate), or \nclinical (symptoms resulting from macroscopic BPH) \nB. Two-thirds of the adult prostate is glandular and one-third is \nfibromuscular. \n1. lntraprostatic dihydrotestosterone, synthesized from testos-\nterone by 5-alpha-reductase type 2, controls glandular growth. \n2. The smooth muscle of the prostate, urethra, and bladder is \nunder alpha-1-adrenergic control. \nC. Prostatic enlargement causes symptoms due to compression \nof the periurethral area and of the bladder; the compression \noccurs because of the physical enlargement of the prostate \nand also because of increased muscle tone in the urethra, \nprostatic fibromuscular tissue, and bladder neck. \n\n492 I CHAPTER 28 \nD. BPH is present in 80% of men in their seventies. \nE. Risk factors for BPH include \n1. Increasing age \n2. Black race \n3. Obesity \n4. Diabetes mc:llirus \n5. High alcohol consumption \n6. Physical inactivity \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Symptoms can be categorized as \n1. Storage symptoms (urgency frequency, nocturia, urge \nincontinence, stress incontinence) \n2. Voiding symptoms (hesitancy, poor flow, straining, dysuria) \n3. Postmicturition symptoms (dribbling, incomplete \nemptying) \nB. Prostate size does not corrdate with symptom severity. \nC. Can use International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to \nassess severity of symptoms and assess response to therapy. \n1. There: arc: 7 questions to be answered on a 0 to 5 scale:, \nyielding a potential total of35 points (Table: 28-5). \n2. Score: 0-7, mild BPH; 8-19, moderate: BPH; 20-35, \nsc:vc:rc: BPH \nD. Digital rectal exam \n1. Cannot ascertain anterior or posterior extension or feel \nentire: posterior surface:. \n2. Therefore, prostate size is underestimated by 25-55% on \ndigital rectal exam, compared with transrectal ultrasound; \nthe underestimation increases the larger the prostate \nvolume:. \n~ \nThe prostate is bigger than it feels on digital \n,,.. rectal exam. \nTable28-5. International Prostate Symptom Score. \nNot at All \nOver the past month, h-ott.n  \nhave you had a sensation of not emptying your bladder \ncompletely after you finished urinating? \nhave you had to urinate again less than 2 hours after you \nfinished urinating? \nhave you found you stopped and started again several times \nwhen you urinated? \nhave you found it difficult to postpone urination? \nhave you had a weak urinary stream? \nhave you had to push or strain to begin urination? \ndid you most typically get up to urinate from the time you went \nto bed at night until the time you got up fn the morning? \nScoring Key: 0-7, mild; 8--19 moderate; 20-35, severe. \n0 \n0 \n0 \nE. Guidelines recommend all symptomatic patients have: a digital \nrectal exam, urinalysis, and serum crc:atininc:; other testing \n(urodynamics, imaging) is optional. PSA testing is often done \nafter shared decision making. \nF. Although BPH can cause hematuria, other causes of hematuria \nshould be considered (see Chapter 21, Hematuria). \nG. Urinary florates, urodynamic measwements, and amount of \npostvoid residual do not correlate: well with symptoms. \nTreatment \nA. All men should be advised regarding behavioral interventions \nsuch as avoiding fluids before bed or going out, reducing \nintake of caffeine and alcohol, and double voiding to ensure \nbladder emptying. \nB. If possible:, diuretics should be discontinued in order to \nminimize symptoms. \nC. Men with mild symptoms (as defined by the IPSS) generally \ndo not require pharmacologic treatment. \nD. Men with moderate or severe symptoms {as defined by the \nIPSS) should be: treated with pharmacotherapy. \n1. Alpha-blockers {tera:zosin and doxawsin) \na. Work on the alpha-adrenergic rc:cc:ptors of prostatic \nsmooth muscle \nb. Common side effects include: orthostasis, hypotc:nsion, \nand fatigue. \nc. Selective alpha-blockers {tamsulosin and alfuzosin) may \nhave less pronounced effects on BP. \n2. 5-alpha reductasc: inhibitors (flnasteride and dutasteridc:) \na. Prevent the conversion of testosterone to active \ndihydrotestosterone \nb. Common side effects include: decreased libido, erectile \ndysfunction, and gynecomastia. \n3. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil) are \nalso effective. \n4.

He is generally healthy \nand independent. but over the past 2 months has had \ndecreased energy and vague abdominal pain. Over the last \n3 days. he has been complaining of pain In his right flank. \nfor which he has been taking ibuprofen. He has been drink.Ing \nllqulds but not eating much. His past medical history Is \nnotable for long-standing hypertension, BPH, and remote \ncolorectal cancer. He tak.es losartan, amlodlpine, and flnas-\nteride. On physical exam, he is alert but confused. His BP \nIs 160/80 mm Hg. pulse Is 88 bpm. RR Is 16 breaths per \nminute, and he Is afebrlle. There Is no adenopathy, lungs are \nclear, and cardiac exam Is normal. Abdominal exam shows \nno masses or tendemess; there is mild right-sided abdom-\ninal tenderness with normal bowel sounds.

His age, prostatic \nenlargement, and vague complaints of abdominal and flank pain \nare all pivotal points suggesting urinary tract obstruction. How-\never, he also could have prercnal AKI from either NSAID use or \nintravascular volume depletion. Furthermore, renal hemodynamics \nare altered by angiotensin receptor blockers which can contribute \nto prerenal AKI. He has no history suggesting a specific intrarenal \ncause, although the history of hypertension puts him at increased \nrisk. Thus, intrarenal causes would be considered only if no post-\nrenal or prerenal cause could be identified, or if the urinalysis were \nsuggestive (granular or cellular casts). Table 28-6 lists the differen-\ntial diagnosis. \nKIDNEY INJURY, ACUTE I 493 \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nThe indwelling urinary catheter is replaced and tamsulosin \nstarted.

Moreover, the lopostvoid \nresidual is not suggestive of urethral obstruction due to prostatic \nenlargement. The possibility of urinary tract obstruction above the \nlevel of the bladder should be considered. \nLeading Hypothesis: Urinary Tract Obstruction \nTextbook Presentation \nSymptoms vary with site, degtee, and rapidity of onset of the \nobstruction. Obstruction may cause pain if acute or may be pain-\nless if chronic. Incontinence and dribbling are common if the \nobstruction is urethral. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Clinical manifestations \n1. Upper ureteral or renal pdvic lesions can cause flank pain; \nlower obstruction can cause pdvic pain that sometimes \nradiates to the ipsilateral testicle or labium. \n2. Obstruction must be bilateral to cause AKI; therefore, \nthe most common cause of obstructive AKI is prostatic \nenlargement. \n3. Urinary output \na. Anuria, if obstruction is complete \n(1) Anuria is defined as < 100 mL of urine per day. \n(2) Also seen in shock, vascular lesions, severe ATN, \nor severe GN. \nb. Output can be normal or increased with partial \nobstruction. \nc. Increased output is due to tubular injury that impairs \nconcentrating ability and sodium reabsorption. \nd. Incontinence, dribbling, decreased output, and \nhematuria may be present. \nB. Obstruction accounts fur 17% of cases of outpatient AKI, and \nfor 2-5% of cases of inpatient AKI and is more commonly \nseen in men than women. \nC. Obstruction can lead to a type 4 renal tubular acidosis with \nhyperkalemia due to tubular injury. \nD. In patients with normal kidneys, unilateral obstruction often \nis undetected because the unobstructed kidney compensates \nenough to maintain normal kidney function. \nE. Prognosis \n1. Complete or prolonged partial obstruction can lead to \ninterstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and irreversible loss \nof kidney function. \na. Complete recovery of kidney function occurs if total \nureteral obstruction is relieved within 7 days; little or \nno recovery occurs if the total obstruction is present for \n12 weeks. \nb. Obstruction is a rare cause of end-stage renal disease. \n2. Prognosis of partial obstruction is unpredictable. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Urine electrolytes are not very helpful. \nB. The poscvoid residual will be increased (> 100 mL) if the \nobstruction is urethral; the postvoid residual will be normal if \nthe obstruction is proximal to the bladder. \nC. Renal ultrasound \n1. The best first test to look for obstruction \n2. Has a sensitivity of 90-98% and specificity of 65-84% for \ndetecting urinary tract obstruction \n3. There are 4 settings in which obstruction can occur without \ndilatation of the complete collecting system, leading to a \nfalse-negative ultrasound. \na. With very early ( < 8 hours) obstruction \nb. When the patient is also volume depleted; sometimes \nrepeating an ultrasound after hydration will demonstrate \nthe dilatation \nc. With retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond disease), which \ncan cause hydronephrosis without ureteral dilatation; the \nhydronephrosis and fibrosis are better seen on CT scan \nd. With obstruction so mild that there is no impairment in \nkidney function \nD. Noncontrast CT can detect sites of obstruction missed on \nultrasound and is superior to ultrasonography for determining \nthe site of ureteral obstruction. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nA renal ultrasound shows an 11-cm right kidney with \nmarked hydronephrosls and ureteral dilation. The left kidney \nmeasured 7 cm with significant cortical atrophy. A non-\ncontrast abdominal CT scan revealed a 5-cm colonic mass \nImpinging upon t he right uret.er. \nHavs you croe&sd a diagnoetlc threshold \nfor ths lsading hyPOths&i&, urinary tract \nobetructlon? Have you ruled out the activs \nalternatives? Do other test& need to be done \nto e><clude the alternative dlagnosee? \nAt this point, no additional tests are needed to confirm urinary \ntract obstruction. The difference in sizes of the kidneys suggests \nunderlying unilateral renal disease. In elderly individuals, unilateral \nrenal artery stenosis or renal artery embolism (atheroembolism or \nthromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation) may lead to \nrenal atrophy and is frequently asymptomatic. This patient's kid-\nney function is likely asymmetric. Because his small left kidney is \nlikely nonfunctional, he devdoped AKI due to unilateral obstruc--\ntion of the right kidney. \nTreatment \nA Relieve the obstruction immediately. \n1. Modalities \na. Indwelling urinary catheter for bladder neck obstruction \n~ \nRemember that indwelling catheters can be \n,._,.... \nobstructed by clots. \nb. Suprapubic catheter, if indwelling urinary is not possible \nc. Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes for ureteral obstruction \nd. Ureteral OJ) stents for ureteral obstruction, if accessible. \nThere is no evidence in the literature of statistically \nsignificant differences in efficacy between percutaneous \nnephrostomy versus ureteral scenting. \n2. Consequences \na. Rapid decompression of the bladder can rarely lead to \nhematuria and even hypotension. \n\nb. A postobstructive diuresis is common, with an initial \nurinary output of 500-1 OOO mL/hour. \n(1) Mechanisms involved include excretion of retained \nfluid during the period of obstruction, diuresis of \nosmotically active solutes, such as urea, and tubular \ndysfunction leading to inability to reabsorb water \nand sodium. \n(2) May require initial 1: 1 replacement of fluid losses \nwith hypotonic (112-normal) saline to prevent \nvolume depletion, with subsequent decrease in the \nratio of fluid replacement. \n(3) Should monitor dectrolytes closdy and replace as \nneeded \nB. Correct the underlying cause of the obstruction. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. F Is a 63-year-old woman with a history of dlastollc \ndysfunction, hypertension. and knee and hip osteoarthri-\ntis. Her usual medications are atenolol, lisinopril. and acet-\naminophen, and her basellne serum creatlnine is 1.1 mg/ dL. \nFour weeks ago, she came to your office with severe pain, \nerythema. and swelllng of her right first metatarsophalan-\ngealjolnt. \nYou diagnosed gout and prescribed lndomethacln \n25 mg 3 times dally until the symptoms resolved. She \nretumed for a follow-up yesterday. reporting that the gout \nhad resolved in a fedays, but that she kept taking the \nindomethacin because It also relieved her chronic knee and \nhip pain. Despite your reservations. you agree to refill the \nprescription because she clearly feels so much better than \nusual, cautioning her to use the medication only when she \nneeds It. Today you receive the results of the blood tests \nyou ordered during the visit: Na, 141 mEq!L; K. 5.0 mEq!L; \nCl, 100 mEq!L; HC03, 20 mEq!L; BUN, 32 mg/dL; creatin-\nine, 2.5 mg/dl. \nAt this point, what I& the leading hypothesis, \nwhat are the active altematlvH, and Is \nthere a muet not miH diagnosis? Given thle \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests should .be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAt this point, the differential for her AKI is quite broad, but it is \nlogical to focus on the pivotal point, in this case, the recent use \nof indomethacin. Through prostaglandin inhibition, NSAIDs \ncan cause decreased renal blood flow, leading to a prerenal state. \nNSAIDs are also 1 of the classes of drugs most commonly asso-\nciated with an intrarenal disease, interstitial nephritis. Although \nobstruction must always be considered, she is having no urinary \nsymptoms and has no risk. factors.

Can occur with nonsdective NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. \nB. Renal prostaglandins are particularly important in the autoreg-\nulation of glomerular pressure and GFR in patients with other \n\n496 I CHAPTER 28 \ncauses of impaired autoregulation, suc:h as CKD, hypertension, \nvolume depletion, HF, and cirrhosis. \nC. Prostaglandin inhibition in such patients can lead to significant \ndecreases in renal blood flow, consequent reversible renal \nischemia, and AKI. \nD. Seen within 3-7 days of staning therapy. \nE. Renal prostaglandins are not important regulators of blood \nfloin normal kidneys, and so AKI from NSAIDs docs not \ndevelop in patients with normal kidney function. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA F~ should be < 1 % since the mechanism is impaired perfusion. \n(Sensitivity and specificity are unknown.) \nB.

She has not used diuretics or received IV fluids, \nboth of which can cause a falsely elevated urine Na and F~ \n.. In \naddition, her creatinine has not improved and her urinalysis is \nabnormal. Therefore, it is unlikely that prostaglandin inhibition is \nthe reason for her kidney disease. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Interstitial Nephritis \nTextbook Presentation \nClassic findings include AKI, hematuria, pyuria with WBC casts, \nfever, and eosinophilia. The full syndrome is rarely seen today, \nsince it occurs primarily with methicillin-induced acute interstitial \nnephritis. \nDisease Higblighui \nA Interstitial nephritis is found in 2-3% of all kidney biopsies, \nand in 15-27% of patients who have a biopsy done for AKI. \nB. Etiology \n1. Drug-induced \na. Accounts for at least 66% of cases of acute interstitial \nnephritis; up to 90% of cases in some series \nb. Antimicrobial agents and NSAIDs cause the majority \nof cases; in 2 large series, NSAIDs caused 44% of the \ndrug-induced cases. \nc. Also reported with allopurinol, acyclovir, famotidine, \nfurosemide, omeprazole, phenytoin \n2. Infection-related \na. 15% of acute interstitial nephritis cases \nb. Can be caused by \n(1) Vual infections, suc:h as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr \nvirus, herpes simplex: virus, HIY, mumps, and others \n(2) Bactcrial infections, such as staphylococci, sttcprococci, \nYminia, LegilJneUa \n(3) Other infections, such as mycobacteria, toxoplasmosis, \nsyphilis \n3. Idiopathic \na. 5-10% of cases \nb. Includes tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis \nsyndrome and anti-tubular basement membrane disease \n4. Associated with systemic disease: sarcoidosis, SLE, Sjogren \nsyndrome \nC. Prognosis \n1. Most patients improve within 6-8 weeks and return to \nbaseline kidney function. \n2. Predictors of irreversible injury are diffuse infiltrates and \nfrequent granulomas on biopsy, intake of the offending \ndrug for longer than 1 month, delayed response to \nprednisone, and persistent kidney disease after 3 weeks. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA Clinical findings \n1. Renal manifestations devdop within 3 weeks of exposure \nin 80% of patients, with an average delay of 10 days (range \n1 day to 18 months; longer ddays often seen with NSAIDs). \n2. Symptoms develop more rapidly if the patient is rcc:hallenged \nwith the offending drug. \n3. The classic triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia is seen in \nonly 10-15% of patients. \n4. Table 28-8 summarizes the findings in 2 series reporting \n121 cases of acute interstitial nephritis, 90% of which were \ndrug-induced. \nThe absence of fever, rash, eosinophilia, or \neosinophiluria does not rule out interstitial \nnephritis. \nTable :ZB-8.

See Table 28-9 for an overvieof the \nindications and contraindications of a kidney biopsy. \nTreattnent \nA. Stop exposure, if possible. \nB. Corticosteroids are sometimes used, but there are no prospec-\ntive randomized clinical trials. \n1. Consider in patients whose kidney function does not \nimprove within 1 week of stopping exposure, after biopsy \nconfirms diagnosis. \n2. Consider empiric trial in patients who have worsening \nkidney function and suspected acute interstitial nephritis, \nand who are poor candidates for biopsy. \n3. NSAID-induced acute interstitial nephritis is less \nresponsive to corticosteroid therapy. \n4. Should see improvement in 2-3 weeks. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nHer urinalysis is consistent with interstitial nephritis, and \nthe lack of urine eosinophils does not rule out the diagnosis. \nKidney biopsy is performed, which shows Inflammatory lnfll-\ntrates in the interst!tlum. Her kidney function retums to \nKIDNEY INJURY, ACUTE I 497 \nbaseline several weeks after the NSAIDs are discont inued. \nShe is cautioned to never use NSAIDs in the future to avoid \nrecum:nt interst itial nephrit is. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nAcuteGN \nAcute GN is caused by 1 of several disease processes, all of which \ninvolve immunologically mediated proliferative GN. The classic \nclinical \"nephritic syndrome\" consists of the acute onset of hema-\nturia (with red cell casts), proteinuria, elevated creatinine, hyper-\ntension, and edema. See Table 28-10 for an overvieof etiologies \nand Table 28-11 for the role of complement testing in glomerular \ndiseases. \nRhabdomyolysis \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients may complain of muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine. \nSerum creatine kinase levels are elevated. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Direct trauma to the myocyte, or depletion of ATP within the \ncell, leads to increased intracellular calcium causing persistent \ncontraction and eventual myocyte disintegration. \nB. Leakage of muscle cell contents (electrolytes, myoglobin, \ncreatine kinase, other proteins) then occurs. \nC. Causes of rhabdomyolysis include \n1. Trauma {crush injury) \n2. Exertion {strenuous exercise, seizures, alcohol withdrawal \nsyndrome) \n3. Muscle hypoxia (limb compression during prolonged \nimmobilization, major artery occlusion) \n4. Infections {influenza, coxsackievirus, Epstein-Barr virus, \nHIY, Legionetla, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphywcoccus \naureus, C/ostridium, tick-borne infections) \n5. Metabolic {hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, \ndiabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperosmotic conditions) \n6. Drugs/toxins (fibrates, statins, alcohol, heroin, cocaine) \n7. Body temperature changes (heat stroke, malignant \nhyperthermia, malignant neuroleptic syndrome, \nhypothermia) \n8. Genetic defects \n9. Idiopathic \nD. AKI is the most serious complication of rhabdomyolysis. \n1. Rhabdomyolysis causes 7-10% of cases of AKI in the \nUnited States. \n2. Incidence of AKI is 13-50% and is higher in patients who \nuse illicit drugs or alcohol, or who have multiple causes of \nrhabdomyolysis. \n3. Survival in patients with rhabdomyolysis and AKI is \nabout 80%, with most patients recovering kidney \nfunction. \n4. AKI occurs due to myoglobin-induced proximal tubule \ncytotoxiciry, distal rubular obstruction from precipitation \nof myoglobin, and intrarenal vasoconstriction due to \nintravascular volume depletion and activation of renal \nvascular mediators. \n\n498 I CHAPTER 28 \nTable28-10.

Weak corrdation between peak creatine kinase and develop-\nment of AKI \n1. Risk of AKI is lowhen the admission creatine kinase is \n< 15,000-20,000 units/L. \n2. AKI may occur with creatine kinase levels as loas \n5000 units/L when coexisting conditions, such as sepsis, \ndehydration, or acidosis, are present. \nB. Urine findings include \n1. Pigmented granular casts \n2. A reddish-brown supernatant \n3. Dipstick testing positive for blood with no RBCs in \nthe sediment (sensitivity of 80% for the detection of \nrhabdomyolysis} \nC. BUN/creatlnine ratio is often low. \nD. Oliguria is frequent, with occasional anuria. \nE. The F~. is < 1 % due to the contribution of vasoconmiction \nto the AKI. \nF. Common electrolyte abnormalities include hyperkalemia, \nhyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, high anion gap metabolic \nacidosis, hypermagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. \nTreatment \nA. Aggressive fluid repletion is essential; some patients require up \nto 10 Uday. \nB. Comparative studies shothat early and high-volume hydra-\ntion is better than delayed hydration; there is no difference \nin outcomes regardless of which type of fluid is used (normal \nsaline, lactated Ringer, sodium bicarbonate}, and adding \nmannitol is not beneficial. \nC. However, massive infusions of normal saline can cause \nmetabolic acidosis, so experts recommend alternating 1 L of \n0.45 normal saline+ bicarbonate with each liter of normal \nsaline if the urine pH is < 6.5. \nVascular Causes of AKI \nVascular events are serious, but rare, causes of AKI. There are \n3 mechanisms of acute vascular compromise: renal anery throm-\nbosis, thromboembolism of the renal arteries, and atheroembolism. \n1. Renal Artery Thrombosis \nTextbook Presentation \nThe classic presentation is severe flank pain, hematuria, nausea, \nvomiting, fever, and hypertension. \n\nTable 28-11.

Hodo I \ndetermine the cause? \nSarah Stein, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMs. N is a 23-year-old woman who comes to see you com-\nplaining of a rash. \n~~ \nWhat fe the differential dlagnoeie of a raeh1 \n~JI\"' Howould you frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nIn clinical practice, rashes are diagnosed through pattern recogni-\ntion (sometimes called system 1 reasoning) probably more than any \nother complaint. This is an effective way of making a diagnosis when \nthe diagnosis is obvious or when the observer is very experienced. \nThe risk with this type of reasoning is that diagnostic hypotheses are \nheavily influenced by recent experience, rare diagnoses tend not to \nbe recognized, and physicians often reach premature closure on an \nincorrect diagnosis. \nThe differential diagnosis of a rash should be based on the \nmorphology of the lesion. This can be considered the first pivotal \npoint in the differential diagnosis. To correctly categoriu a lesion's \nmorphology, the physician must first identify the primary lesion, \nthe typical element of the eruption. This process can be compli-\ncated as the primary lesion is often affected by secondary changes \nsuch as excoriation, erosion, crusting, or coalescence. Because \nthe differential diagnosis of 1 lesion can be extensive, once the \nmorphology of the primary lesion is identified, the next pivotal \npoints are determining the global reaction pattern and observing \nthe distribution of lesions. What follows are some important def-\ninitions, followed by a differential diagnosis of some of the most \ncommon reaction patterns. \n1. Macule: lesion without elevation or depression, < 1 cm \n2. Patch: lesion without elevation or depression, > 1 cm \n3. Papule: any solid, elevated \"hump\" < 1 cm \n4. Plaque: raised plateau-like lesion of variable size, often a \nconfluence of papules \n5. Nodule: solid lesion with palpable elevation, 1-5 cm \n6. Tumor: solid growth, > 5 cm \n7. Cyst: encapsulated lesion, filled with soft material \n8. Vesicle: elevated, fluid-filled blister, < 1 cm \n9. Bulla: elevated, fluid-filled blister, > 1 cm \n10. Pustule: elevated, pus-filled blister, any size \n11. Wheal: inflamed papule or plaque formed by transient \nand superficial local edema \n12. Comedone: a plug of keratinous material and skin oils \nretained in a follicle; open comedone has a black inclusion, \nclosed comedone appears flesh-colored or pinkish \nPrimary lesions are further grouped into reaction patterns. \nPapulosquamous eruptions present with papules and plaques \nassociated with superficial scaling. Folliculopapular eruptions \nbegin as papules arising in a perifollicular distribution. Dermal \nreaction patterns result from infiltrative and inflammatory pro-\ncesses involving the dermal and subcutaneous tissues. Petechia \nand purpura occur when there is leakage of blood products into \nsurrounding tissues from inflamed or damaged blood vessels. \nBlistering disorders present with vesicles and bullae.

This pati.c.nt has a fulliculopapular eruption \nthat predominantly affects the face. chest, and upper back. Primary \nlesions of inflammatory papulcs, pustules, and comedones place \nacne at the top of the differential. The history is typical for acne: a \nchronic cowse with intermittent flares. \nOther fulliculopapular conditions must be considered. The lack \nof background erythema and tdangicctasi.as makes a diagnosis of \nrosacca less likely. Perioral dermatitis typically presents as mono. \nmorphic small papulcs and is closely associated with the use of \ntopical corticosteroids and cosmetics. The mixtwe of lesion type, \nwith com.cdoncs as well as papulcs and nodules, and the more dif-\nfuse disttibution makes acne more likely than perioral dermatitis. \nAn infectious fulliculitis is possible, but the course of the disease \nmakes this extremely unlikely (Table 29-1). \n\nThe patient Is In good health and Is not overweleht.

A variety oflcsiot15 are present, including \ninflammatory papules, pustules, comedones, and nodulocysts over \nthe face, chest, and back. \n\n504 I CHAPTER 29 \nDisease Highlights \nA. Description of lesion: inflammatory papules, pustules, \ncomedones, and nodulocysts over the face, chest, and back \n(see Figure 29-2). \nB. Acne is a highly prevalent condition, most common during \nmid-to-late adolescence. \nC. Acne may persist beyond adolescence, especially in women. \nD. Acne is caused by the obstruction of sebaceous follicles on the \nface and trunk. Three factors are involved in the development \nof the lesions: \n1. Increased sebum is produced (androgen dependent) and \naccumulates in follicles. \n2. Desquamation of epithelial cells and keratin into sebum-rich \nfollicles causes obstruction. \n3. Inflammation develops as the anaerobe Propionibactmum \nacnes proliferates in this closed environment. \nE. Although the 3 factors discussed above are responsible for \nmost cases of acne, it is important to keep in mind other \nfactors that may contribute to the disease. \n1. Hyperandrogen states {most commonly polycystic ovary \nsyndrome [PCOS] or androgenic progestins in contraceptives). \n2. Exposure to topical comedogens (cocoa butter, mineral oil, \nlanolin, fatty acids). \n3. Numerous factors that lead to follicular obstruction \n(eg, habits or clothing that cause skin trauma or obstruct \npores, hot humid environments or heavy sweating leading \nto keratin over-hydration}. \n4. Medications known to trigger or exacerbate acne \n(eg, corticosteroids, isoniazid, lithium, androgens). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis is typically clinical. \nB. Work-up for hyperandrogenism is appropriate when there are \nsigns of polycystic ovary disease, virilization, or an atypical \npresentation (such as later in life). \nTreatment \nA. Identify and remedy the acne precipitants discussed above. \nB. Reviegeneral skin care techniques for acne-prone skin. \n1. Vigorous scrubbing can aggravate acne by promoting the \ndevelopment of inflammatory lesions. \n2. Abrasive cleaners and mechanical devices also aggravate \nacne by promoting inflammation. \n3. Use of one's hands and a mild cleanser with lukewarm \nwater is best. \n4. Use of moisturizers should be minimized and all cosmetics \nand lotions should be oil-free. \n5. Minimize contact of facial skin with hair gds and other \nstyling products (pomade acne}. \nC. Medical therapy is aimed at the 3 factors involved in acne \ndevelopment. \n1. Decreasing sebum production \na. No topical therapies are effective \nb. F.strogen \n(1) Most effective at doses of> 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol \n(2) Common oral contraceptive pills containing s 35 mcg \nethinyl estradiol are still helpful. \nc. Antiandrogens (spironolactone) \nd. Isotretinoin {see later discussion} \n2. Alteration of epithelial rurnover and cohesiveness \na. Topical retinoids: tretinoin, tazarotene \nb. Adapalene: a naphthoic acid with retinoid activity \n3. P acnes proliferation and accompanying inflammation \na. Topical antibiotics \n(1) Erythromycin \n(2) Clindamycin \n(3) Metronidazole \n(4) Benzoyl peroxide \nb. Systemic antibiotics \n(1) Tetracycline class \n(2) Macrolide class \n(3) Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole \nD. Guidelines for the use of these medications are as follows: \n1. Predominantly comedonal acne: retinoid or adapalene \n2. Mild inflammatory acne: topical antibiotic and benzoyl \nperoxide with or without retinoid or adapalene \n3. Moderate to severe but noncystic inflammatory acne: \nsystemic antibiotic in combination with a topical retinoid \n4. Nodular cystic acne: isotretinoin \na. Should only be prescribed by clinicians experienced in \nits use because of potential adverse effects \nb. Has the potential to cause hypertriglyccridemia and \ndepression \nc. Effective contraception must be assured because it is a \npotent teratogen. \nE. Additional considerations \n1. Oral contraceptives are useful in women with a strong \nhormonal component. \n2. Spironolactone can be useful in adult women with \nrecalcitrant acne. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nA clinical diagnosis of acne is most likely. Although PCOS might \nbe considered based on the older age of the patient and the distri-\nbution oflesions along the jaline, the patient lacks the oligomen-\norrhea that, along with evidence ofhyperandrogenism, is necessary \nfor making the diagnosis. \nA clinical diagnosis of acne is made, and discussion about the \nmost appropriate therapy begins. \nHave you crossed a diagnostic threshold for \nthe leading hypothe&le acll6 vulgarl91 Have \nyou ruled out the active alternatives? Do \nother tests need to be done to exclude the \nalternative dlagn09eei' \nAlternative Diagnosis: Rosacea \nTatbook Presentation \nCommonly presents in adults with a facial rash. There is a gradual \ndevelopment of telangiectasias and persistent centrofacial erythema \noccasionally with inflammatory red papules and papulopustules. \nComedones are absent. There is often a history of easy flushing. \n\nFigure 29-3. Rosacea. (Used with permission from Dr. Anne \nE. Laumann.) \nThe rash may worsen with sun exposure, ingestion of spicy foods \nand thermally hot foods/liquids, emotional stress, and exercise. \nDisease Higblights \nA. Description oflcsion: ccntro&cial persistent f.u:ial erythema, \ntdangiocwias, and, occasionally, inflammatory papul.cs and \npapul.opwtu1C5 (Figw'e 29-3). \nB. Rasacca is most common in fair-skinned individuals of northern \nEuropean descent but can be seen in people with darker skin \nas well. \nC. Women arc more commonly a1fccted than men. \nD. However, oomplicatcd disease with sebaceous gland hyperplasia \nand rhinophyma (sebaceous overgrowth causing deformity of \nthe nose) dcvdops more often in men. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT W \nMr. B Is an 18-year-old man who was In good health until \n1 week ago, when he noted that the left side of his chest \nwas painful. One day before his visit. he noticed a rash \non the left sit.le of his chest. just lateral to his stemum. \nHe describ6s the rash as small bumps. blisters. and red \nRASH I SOS \nE. Rosacea typically begins later than acne and reaches a peak in \nmiddle age. That said, the 2 can overlap. \nF. Sun exposure is thought to be a trigger and sun-damaged skin \nis frequently seen in patients with rosacea. \nG. Ocular rosacea is common, perhaps affecting more than half \nof patients with rosacea. and includes oonjunctival hyperemia, \nanterior blepharitis, and kcratitis. \nEvidence-Baaed Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosis is by clinical presentation. \nB. Histopathology, which is rarely nCCC$.Sary, varies according to \nthe stage and wriant of the disease and is often nonspecific. \nTreatment \nA.

Blisters can \nbe a symptom of infection, autoimmune disease, or a reaction to \nan c:xt:cmal stimulus. Infectious causes include varicella zostcr virus \n(l/ZV), presenting either as chi.ckenpox or hctpc5 zostcr (shingics). \nand bullous impetigo. Both are possible in this patient. The pro-\nd.tom.al pain and unilateral, derm.atomal distribution suggest VZV. \nBullous impetigo can cause blisters in a young. healthy person, but \nthese blisters often begin in intertriginous areas. Bullous impetigo \nis most common in children. Grouped blisters suggest V'ZV or \nherpes simplex. virus (HSV), whereas other blistering diseases may \ndemonstrate large distinct blisters or erosions. \nBullous a.tth.ropod bites can affect patients of any age. A ~ \ntory of exposure should be elicited. The numerous, small, clustered \nlesions, in this case, make arthropod bites a less likely diagnosis. \nBullous pemphigoid and other autoimmune blistering disorders \nare rare but possible. StevensJohnson syndrome is unlikely given \nthe subacute onset but is certainly a \"must not miss\" diagnosis \n(Table 29-2). \n\nThe patient repon;s no 5lgnlflcant m&llcal hl5tory.

The lesioD5 begin as closely grouped vesicles on an \nerythematous base. Over 2-3 days, the lesions become pustular \nand then crust over after 7-10 days. Pain and paresthesias along the \ninvolved dermatome often pre<le the rash by a fedays. \nDisease Higblighu \nA. Description of the lesion: small, tightly grouped vesicles \non an erythcmatous base oc:curring in one dermatome \n(sec Figure 29-4). Very early in the presentation, the lesions \nare large papules that then become vesicular, then pustular, \nand ultimately crusted. \nB. Characteristics of the lesion \n1. The rash tends to occur in the region where the rash of \nprimary V'ZV infection (chickenpox) was most seven:. \na. The most common dcrmaiomes arc trigeminal and \nT3-L2. \nb. It is not Wlcommon to have a fevesicles in contiguous \ndermatomcs. \n2. Nelesions may appear fur several days, occasionally fur \nup to 7 days. \nC. Shingles is caused by reactiV2tion ofVZV in a dorsal root \nganglion. \nD. Complications \n1. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus \na. Can occur when there is involvement of the fust \ndivision of the trigcminal nerve. \nb. The tip of the nose is in this division so vesicles in \nthis area should raise the possibility of herpes mster \nophthalmicus. \nc. Carries high risk of corneal damage \n\n2. Herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) \na. Reactivation ofV'ZV within the geniculate ganglion \nb. May cause facial paralysis (Bdl palsy) and ear pain \nc. Vesicles can often be seen in the ear canal. \nd. Vestibular and hearing disturbances (venigo and hearing \nloss or tinnitus} are frequently reported. \nE. Disseminated varicdla zoster may occur, most often in immu-\nnocompromised patients. \nF. Varicdla zoster in the elderly \n1. Zoster can be associated with significant morbidity in \ndderly patients. \n2. The rash is more severe and generally lasts longer in the dderly. \n3. Postherpetic neuralgia, a potentially debilitating, long-term \npain syndrome, is also most common in the elderly. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of varicella zoster is usually made clinically \nwithout additional tests. \nB. Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) done of the vesicle \nfluid is useful if the diagnosis is in doubt. \nC. The bedside Tzanck smear of material scraped from a fresh \nvesicle can be supportive evidence but cannot distinguish \nbetween V'ZV and HSY. \nTreatment \nA. In the immunocompetent, the eruption is self-limited; sup-\nportive care with pain rdievers may be all that is necessary. \nB. Patients with any involvement of the eye should be evaluated \nby an ophthalmologist. \nC. Antiviral agents (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir) \n1. Most useful when the rash is diagnosed within the first \n72 hours \n2. Decrease the duration and severity of the disease (including \ndecreasing duration and severity of acute neuropathic pain) \n3. Prevent dissemination \nThe use of antiviral drugs is not beneficial if \nthe rash of varicdla zoster has been present for \nmore than 72 hours. \nD. Symptomatic care: soaks and topical antlpruritics might \nbe useful. \nE. Corticosteroids \n1. Systemic corticosteroids have been used in conjunction \nwith antiviral agents to reduce the duration of the rash \nand the acute pain syndrome. \n2. Meta-analysis showed that systemic corticosteroids are \nprobably ineffective in the prevention of postherpetic \nneuralgia. \nF. Infection control \n1. The vesicle fluid is infectious to individuals who are not \nimmune (neither had chickenpox nor been vaccinated). \n2. Infection risk can, therefore, be reduced by preventing \ndirect contact with the vesicle fluid. \nG. Postherpetic neuralgia \n1. Most commonly complicates disease in the elderly \n2. Potentially severe neuropathic pain syndrome \nRASH I 501 \n3. Meta-analyses shothat systemic corticosteroids, antivirals, \nand other supplemental systemic therapies (gabapentin, \npregabalin, amitriptyline) are ineffective in the prevention \nof postherpetic neuralgia, while supplemental interventional \nprocedures (nerve block, epidural analgesics, transcutaneous \nelectric nerve stimulation) may be beneficial. \nH. Prevention \n1. An inactivated recombinant vaccine was approved for use \nin the United States in 2017. \n2. This vaccine has an efficacy of97.2% in patients over age 50. \n3. It is also effective in older patients (efficacy 90% for \n70-79 years of age and 89.1%for80 years of age or older). \n4. The vaccine is recommended for patients over the age of 50. \na. Patients should receive the vaccine regardless of whether \nthere is a history of chickenpox. \nb. The vaccine should also be given 6-12 months after an \nepisode of varicella zoster. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nGiven the patient's prodromal symptoms and classic dermatomal \ndistribution, varicdla zoster is the leading diagnosis. Because the rash \nwas thought to be somewhat atypical, a fresh vesicle was unroofed \nwith a scalpd tip and the vesicle fluid was sent for PCR testing. \nThe diagnosis of varicdla zoster is often clinical. The distribution \nand clinical appearance of lesions, as wdl as the associated prodro-\nmal symptoms, can make the diagnosis obvious. Impetigo, bullous \narthropod bites, and autoimmune blistering diseases typically \ndemonstrate larger distinct blisters or erosions. Stevens-Johnson \nsyndrome and other drug reactions must always be considered \nwhen medications are in use. This patient was taking amoxicillin. \nThe clinical appearance of the lesions, their locali7.ed distribution, \nand the overall time course of the symptoms are not consistent with \nthis eruption, so varicella zoster must still lead the list. \nHave you c:roeNd a dlagn09tlc threshold for \nthe leading hypothesis varlcalla zostar1 Have \nyou ruled out the active alternative&? Do \nother ta&t& need to be dona to exclude the \naltamatlve diagnoses? \nAlternative Diagnosis: Bullous Impetigo \nTextbook Presentation \nMost commonly seen in children, bullous impetigo presents as \nflaccid, transparent bullae in the intertriginous areas. The blisters \nrupture easily and leave a rim of scale and shallomoist erosion. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Description of the lesion: flaccid bullae on normal skin \n(Figure 29-5) \nB. Location of the lesion \n1. Develops on grossly intact skin as a result oflocal toxin \nproduction. \n2. This is in contrast to nonbullous impetigo, shown in \nFigure 29-6, resulting from Staphylococcus or Streptococcus \ninfection, which tends to affect previously traumatized skin. \n3. lesions most commonly develop on moist, intertriginous skin. \nC. Superficial skin infection that most commonly affects infants \nand young children \n\n508 I CHAPTER 29 \nFigure 2t-5. Bullous impetigo. \nFigure lH. Impetigo. \nD. The causative agent is Staphylococcus aumu. \nE. The blistering is caused by the production of exfoliatin or \nepidermolytic toxins. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosis is by clinical presentation. \nB. Culture of blister fluid or the moist edge of a crusted plaque \nmay be diagnostic. \nTreatment \nA. Oral antibiotics active against S aureus should be prescribed \nfur bullous impetigo. The possibility of mcthicillin-rcsistant \nS a\"mu (MRS.A) must be considered. \nB. Loc::aliu:d, nonbullous impetigo may be adequately treated \nwith topical antibiotics (e.ffecti.ve against gram-positive cocci) \nsuch as: \n1. Bacitracin \n2. Polymyxin \n3. Mupirocin \nC. Recurrent infections may indicate staphylococcal carriage. \nEradication measures including daily washing with chlorho:-\nidine gluconate, intranasal mupirocin ointment, and oral \nrif.unpin and doxycycline have been modestly succ:cssfuL \nFigure 2t-7. Bullous arthropod bites. \nD. Family members and close contacts may also be colonized \nand warrant investigation and treatment when appropriate. \nEnvironmental sources such as shared towels and athletic \nequipment should be considered. \nAltematlve Diagnosis: Bullous Arthropod Bites \nTextbook Presentation \nThis condition commonly presents as a duster of tense blisters on \nexposed skin. The blisters tend to be large c~ 1 cm) and surround \ning skin is normal. \nDiseaH Highlights \nA. Description of the lesion: luge, often tense blisters on normal \nskin (Figure 29-7). \nB. Character and location of the lesion \n1. The lesions tend to develop in exposed areas of the skin, \nsuch as the extremities. \n2. The patient will otherwise appear well. \n3. The lesions are typically extraordinarily pruritic. \n4. Although the blisters arise from otherwise normal skin, \nsurrounding inflammatory changes from rubbing and \nscratching arc often present. \nC. Arthropod bite reactions are dermal hypersensitivity reactions \nto antigens from the saliva of insects. \nD. Bedbugs, fleas, mosquitos and many varieties of mites are all \ntypical culprits. \nE. It is not possible to identify the culprit insect by the appearance \nof the bite. \nE'Videnc:e-Bued Diagnotia \nA. Diagnosis is made by clinical presentation. \nB. Histopathology, though rarely necessary, can be supportive, \ndemonstrating edema, a subepidermal blister, and a dermal \ninflammatory infiltrate with numerous eosinophils. \nTreatment \nA. Avoidance of future bites with use of protective clothing and \ninsect repellants. \nB. Attention to eradicating the source of the biting insects, such \nas on pets, nests, etc. \n\nC. Supponive local care to prevent secondary infu:tion and \nrelieve prurirus. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Bullous Pemphigoid \nTa.tbook Presentation \nBullous pemphigoid is usually seen in elderly patients wjth the \nsudden onset of 1-2 cm tense blisters and bright red, urticarial \nplaques. Lesions often begin on the lower extremities and progress \nupward. \nDisease Higblights \nA. Description of the lesion: tense bullae arising on skin that may \nbe normal, c.ryth.cmatous, or urticarial (Figure 29-8). \nB. Bullous pcmphigoid is an autoimmune disease primarily \naffecting the elderly. \nC. Autoantibodics are targeted against components of the epider-\nmal basement memb1'2l'le zone, thus triggering separation and \nblistering. \nD. The lesions heal without scarring. \nE. Most cases occur sporadicallywithout obvious precipitating \nfactors. \nF. Character and location of the lesion \n1. Predilection ofbwters for the extremities \n2. Lesions range from asymptomatic to intensely pruritic. \n3. Mucosa! sw:fucs are rarely involved. \nFigure 29-8. Bullous pemphlgold. (Used with pennlsslon from \nDr. Curl Yun.) \nRASH I 509 \nG. Other blistering syndromes, such as pemphigus vulgaris and \nepidcrmolysis bullosa acquisita, are caused by antibodies to \nother elements of the basement membrane zone. \nEvidence-Based Diagnom \nA. Histopath.ology provides supportive informarion, demonstrating \na subcpidcrmal blister plane and aa:wnulat:ion of eosinophils. \nB. Immunopathology confirms the diagnosis by demonstrating \nlinear deposits of IgG and C3 at the dennal-epidennal junction. \nC. In 70-80% of patients, circulating IgG that recognizes the \nidentified antigens of the basement membrane zone can be \nfound. \nTteatment \nA. Topical, potent conicosteroids can be effective. \nB. Extensive disease can be treated with systemic corticosteroids. \nC. Steroid-sparing immunosuppressives are used to limit the \ntoxicities of systemic corticosteroids in chronic disease. \nD. Alternative antl-inlammatory agents, such as tetracycline and \nnicotinamide, may be effective. \nE. Remission is usually obtained within a feweeks; however, \nsome degree oflong-term therapy may be neceuary. \nR Refractory case5 may respond to plasmaphere5is, intravenous \ngammaglobulin, or rituximab. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Stevens-Johnson \nSyndrome \nTextbook Piaentation \nStevens-Johnson syndrome typically presents in a patient with \nfever, malaise, headache, and myalgias who is taking a potentially \ncausative medicarion. After about 1 week of symptoms, a macular \nrash develops on the cbe.st and face. These lesions subsequently \nblister and then rapidly erode.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are \nhypersensitivity reaction patterns involving the skin. \n1. These 2 conditions are often considered to be on a \nspectrum of severity. Stevens-Johnson syndrome involves \nless body surface area, whereas toxic epidermal necrolysis \nleads to considerable areas of full-thickness skin sloughing. \n2. Although the precise cause has not been found, drugs are \ninvolved in most cases. \nC. More than 200 drugs have been implicated as causes of \nStevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. \nD. An older, but well-done case-control trial identified com-\nmon culprits. These are listed in Table 29-3 with their \nassociated ORs. \nE. Disease course \n1, Prodromal symptoms, characterized by fever, malaise, \nheadache, myalgias, as well as gastrointestinal and \nrespiratory complaints, occur over 1-2 weeks. \n2.

The rash developed f!rst on her trunk and over the \nlast 2 weeks ls spreadlllf:l to her extremities (Fie ure 2 9-1 0). \nShe denies any history of similar eruptions. She states she \nis otherwise feeling well. This eruption is not particularly \n3. The rash may spread and evolve rapidly, with individual \nlesions becoming targetoid with dusky centers and \nultimately coalescing into larger plaques. \n4, Flaccid bullae and vesicles may develop centrally within \ntargets as the skin necroses. \nS. Blisters form and rapidly erode leaving red and raskin \nthat becomes coated by a gray-whitc pseudomembrane. \n6. Mucous membranes \na. Lesions on mucous membranes may accompany or \nprecede the skin rash. \nb. The mucosal surfaces may be tender and burning. \nc. The lips are often swollen, cracked, bleeding, and \ncrusted. \nF. A hallmark of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal \nnecrolysis is the presence of exquisite skin tenderness. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Histopathology suppons the clinical impression. \nB. Pathology demonstrates epidermal necrosis with minimal \nevidence of epidermal and dermal inflammation. \nTreatment \nA. If an offending drug is present, it must be discontinued. \nB. Supportive care in a burn unit is optimal. \nC. Surveillance for secondary infection is critical. \nD. Immunomodulating drugs have been proposed for use early \nin the course of the disease to abon epidermal necrosis and \ndisease progression; however, clear benefit has not been \nconfirmed. \nE. Use of systemic corticosteroids is controversial. Studies \nhave not proven that the benefit outweighs the risk of \nimmunosuppression. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nPCR for VZI/ was positive. thus confirming the diagnosis of \nvaricella z05ter. The patient was prescribed valacyclovlr for \n7 days. He was Instructed to keep the skin lesions covered \nto prevent contacts from being exposed to the Infectious \nvesicle fluid. He was counseled to avoid close contact with \nyoung infants and immunosuppressed individuals until all \nskin lesions are crusted. \nitchy. On examination, there are many 1-2 cm discrete. \nbrightly erythematous plaques and papules with adher-\nent white scale. The lesions are predominantly on t he t runk \nbut extend onto t he extremities. Some lesions appear \nsomewhat linear in confleuration, whereas most are round \nto oval In shape. The scale is confluent over the surface of \nthe lesions. The nails are normal and the palms and soles \nare clear. The oropharynx Is Injected with some tonslllar \n\nFigure 29-1 O.

Common causes \nof papulosquamous eruptions are psoriasis, pityriasis rosc:a, fungal \ninfC<:t:i.ons, and nwrunular dermatitis. \nThe patient's age, acute onset of the rash, and the pattern of \nsmall papules and plaques are pivotal points suggesting either gut-\ntatc psoriasis or pityriasis ro.sea. In addition, the finding of pharyn-\ngeal injection suggests that there may be an infectious component \n(as is common with guttate psoriasis). The configuration of the \nlesions and the scale can be very hdpful in narrowing the differ-\nential diagnosis. This patient's scale is confluent over the surface \nof the lesions, consistc.llt with guttate psoriasis. Tinea. infections \ntypically have scale at the border of the 1e11ions (leading edge with \nadvancing scale) and pityriasis rosca 1scale at the ccnter of the \nlesion (trailing scale). Nummular dermatitis is usually found on \nthe extremities and is a&sociated with significant pruritus, making \nit an unlikdy diagnosis in this case. Secondary syphilis needs to \nbe considered as a \"must not miss\" diagnosis. Syphilis can present \nwith plaques, but they often involve the palms and soles and lack \nan adherent scale (Table 29-4). \n\nOn further questioning, the patlelTl;does re<;all a sore throat \n56Veral week5 aeo.

Description oftc.sion: small (0.5-1.5 cm), round or oval lesions \nwith characteristic overlying silvery scales (sec Figure 29 10). \nB. Character of the lesion \n1. Lesions tend to occur over the upper trunk and proximal \nextremities. \n2. Face, ears, and scalp may also be involved. \n3. The lesions may localize to sites of minor skin trauma. such \nas scrapes (Kocbncr phenomenon). \n4. Eruption generally persists for ~ \nmonths and then remits \nspontaneously. \nC. Most commonly seen in young adults, frequently preceded by \na sttcptococcal throat infection. \nD. Affected patients arc at increased risk for development of \npsoriasis vulgaris in the next 3-5 years. \nE. There is an increased incidence of psoriasis in families. \nEvidence-Baaed Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis is often made based on the clinical presentation. \n\n512 I CHAPTER 29 \nB. The presence of streptococcal pharyngitis would be a \nsupportive finding. \nC. A skin biopsy of an established lesion may demonstrate classic \nhistologic findings of psoriasis vulgaris. \nTreatment \nA.. Guttate psoriasis is typically a self-limited eruption, although \nclearance can take weeks to months. \nB. Remi~ion can be hastened with the use of W light \ntreatments. \nC. If there is an infectious trigger, appropriate antibiotics should \nbe administered. \nD. Antibiotics with anti-.infla.nunatory properties, such as \nerythromycin and tetracycline, can be additionally hdpful \nfor flares. \nE. Topical corticosteroids can be effective on individual lesions. \nE Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided in psoriasis because \nwithdrawal may trigger flares. \nG. Topical calcipottiene, a vitamin D derivative. is also effective. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nBased on the lesions' morphology, funily history. and recent \npharyngitis, guttate psoriasis was considered the likely diagnosis. \nA throat culture was sent.

A \"herald patch,\" \nthe first lesion to devdop, is often the largest lesion and may pre-\ncede onset of other lesions by several weeks. The rash may be \npruritic. \nDiseue Highlights \nA.. Description oflesion: oval or round plaque with central \n(trailing) scale (Figure 29-11). \nB. Character of the lesion \n1. The primary eruption appean as a single oval or toWld, \npink to brownish plaque with a collarette of scale around \nthe iruier margin of the lesion (the herald patch). This \nherald patch most often occurs on the trunk and is often \nmisdiagnosed as tinea corporis. \n2. One to 2 weeks after the appearance of the herald patch, \nthe secondary eruption emerges as generalized smaller but \nsimilar oval scaly plaques distributed along skin tension \nlines in a \"fir uce\" pattern. \n3. Variable degrees of pruritus \n4. Spontaneous resolution occurs over ~12 weeks, often \nwith subsequent postinflanunatory hypopigmentation or \nhyperpigmentation. \nFigure 2t-11. Pityriasis rosea. \nC. A history of a prodrome of mild symptoms of malaise, nausea, \nheadache, and low-grade fever may be present. \nD. Pityrias.is ~ \nis a common worldwide disease without \ngenetic or racial predilection, occurring sporadically through-\nout the year. \nE. A viral cause .is po5tulatcd; evidence suggests but does not \nconfum a role for human herpesvirus 7. \nE'Videnc:e.Bued Diagnotia \nA.. The diagnosis is clinical, based on morphology and distribution \nof the skin lesions. \nB. Skin biopsy demonsttata nonspecific fmdings of a subacute \ndermatitis but can provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis. \nTreatment \nA.. No specific treatment is indicated or effective; the condition \nresolves over ~ \n12 weeks. \nB. In cases with severe pruritw, symptomatic treatment such as \nantihistamines or lopotency topical corticosteroids may be \nbeneficial. \nC. UVB phototherapy has been advocated to decrease the severity, \nparticularly when administered early in the course. This treat-\nment may worsen the postinflammatory dyspigmentation. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Tinea Corporis \nTmbook Presentation \nTinea corporis conunonly presents as round. pink plaques with \nsmall peripheral papules and a rim of scales. The neck and back are \nthe most common locations (Figure 29-12). \nDiaeue Highlights \nA.. Description of the lesion: multiple lesions are possible. \n1. Circular lesions with a sharply marginated raised border \nand central clearing, a.rising by centrifugal spread of the \nfungus from the initial site of infection \n2. Inflammatory lesions may demonstrate pustules or vesicles, \nespecially around the margin. \n3. Overlying scale is common, typically more prominent at \nthe border of the lesion. \n4. Solitary lesions may occur, or there may be multiple \nplaques that remain discrete or become confluent. \n\nFigure 29-12. Tlnea corporis. \nB. The degree of associated inflammatory change is variable, \ndepending on the causative species of fungu.s. \nC. The wide variation in clinical presentation depends on the \nspecies of fungus, size of the inoculwn, body site infected. \nand immune Statu.$ of the patient. \nEvidence-Buecl Diagnosia \nA. Microscopic identification of fungal dements after application \nof 5-20% potassium hydro:&ide (KOH) solution to lesional \nscrapings collected on a microscope slide \nB. Culture of tissue material (such as lesional sa:apings) \nC. Histopathology is tardy necessary to make the diagnosis \nof a superficial infection, but with the use of special stains \n(periodic acid-Schiff or Gomori methenamine silver) the \nfungal elements may be visible in faxed sections. \nTreatment \nA. Both topical and systemic antifungal agents are effective. The \nchoice is determined by the extent and location of the infection. \nB. Hair-bearing sites often require systemic therapy. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Nummular Dermatitis \nTextbook Prae.atadon \nNummular dermatitis generally presents as an extremely pruritic \nrash of numerous, round, crusted lesions on the lower c:x.uemities. \nDisease Higblights \nA.

The lesions are present \ndiffusely, including on the palms and soles. A history of a transient. \npainless, genital ulcer in the pteceding weeks CUJ. often be obtained. \nDisease Higbllghts \nA. Description oflesion: papulcs and plaques distributed over the \nentire body. They are copper red to hyperpigmented in color. \nB. Character of the lesion \nI. Lesions may vary at different stages of disease. \na. A fleeting eruption of symmetric, coppery red, round \nand oval macules may be seen early in the secondary \nstage, about 8 weeb after the infecting c:xposure. \nb. The later, d;wic eruption includes involvement of \nmucosa! surfaces and palms and soles. \nc. In the latest phases, thick scales may cover the plaques. \n2. The rashes of secondary syphilis are nonprurit:i.c. \n3. The lesions arc generally symmetrically distributed. \nEYidence-Buecl Diagnosis \nA. Tests fur syphilis include non-treponemal and tteponemal tests. \nI. Non-ueponemal tests assess the reactivity of serum to a \ncardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen. They include the \nrapid plasma reagin (RPR) and the venereal disease research \ntest (VDRL). \n2. Treponemal tests are qualitative tests (\"reactive\" or \n\"nonreactive\") that detect antibodies dirtx:ted against \n\n514 I CHAPTER29 \nspecific trcponemal antigens. They include the fluorescent \ntreponcmal antibody (PTA), microhcmagglutination \nTrtponema pal&ium (MHA-TP), and Trtpontm11 pal/Ulum \nenzyme immunoassay (fP-EIA.). \n3. Trcponemal tests arc more specific than non-treponcmal \nones. \nB. Syphilis diagnosis is based on both trcponemal and non-\ntrcponcmal tests. Most laboratories employ algorithms that \nuse a ttc:poncmal test as the scrccning test followed by a \nnon-trcponcmal test for confirmation if the treponcmal test \nis poaitive. \nTreatment \nPenicillin is the treatment of choice for secondary syphilis. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nThe patlem;'s 'l;hroat cu~re reveale<:I group A s'l;reptococ-\ncus. A clinical diagnosis of gutt;ate psoriasis was made. \nThe patient was prescribed 10 days of penicillin as well \nas topical corticosteroids and topical calclpotrlene. UY6 \ntreatmente. 3 times weekly, were \"8gun to Induce remis-\nsion of the psorlatlc flare. She was counselsd on her risk for \nfuture development of psoriasis vu(earis. \nGuttate psoriasis affects those with a predisp~ition toward psoria-\nsis. The guttate flares tend to remit quite reliably; however, affected \nindividuals are at increased risk for the development of chronic \npsoriasis. \nOTHER IMPORTANT CUTANEOUS DISORDERS \nUrtlcarla \nTextbook Presentation \nUrtic:aria typically presents as an itchy rash with large or small, \npalpable, red areas over the entire body. The rash is transient, \nwith no 1 lesion lasting very long. Both the rash and the pruritus \nrespond to antihiswnines. \nDiseuc Higblights \nA. Desaiption of the lesion: transient pink to n:d gently elevated \ncdematous papules and plaques that may coalesce into giant \nlesions. The lesions often leave pwple discoloration or central \nclearing when they fade (Figure 29-14). \nB. Characteristics of the lesion \n1. Individwil. lcsions should n:solve within 24 hours while \nnelesions may continue to devdop. \n2. The eruption is typically accompanied by itch, but \nexcoriations are rate. \nC. Mucous membranes, eyelids, hands, and feet may devdop \ndeeper subcutaneous swelling manifesting as angi.ocd.cma. \nD. Most urticaria is acute, lasting < 6 weeks. \nE. Urticaria is a hypersensitivity reaction to numerous insults. \n1. Etiologic fu:tors can be remembered with the mnemonic \nI-I-I-1-l \na. Infection \nFlgurelt-14. Urtlcaria. \nb. Infestation \nc. Ingestion (food or drug) \nd. Inhalation \nc. Injection \n2. Idiopathic should be added to this list. \nF. Chronic urticaria (lasting > 6 weeks) can also be idiopathic, \nor associated with systemic disorders such as collagen vucular \ndisease, malignancy, parasitosis, and chronic infection. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Clinical findin~ of typical transient urticaria arc diagnostic, \nand a skin biopsy is rarely indicated. \nB. The morphologic differential diagnosis often includes the \nfollowing: \n1. Erythcma multiformc (becawe of the wgctoid appearance \nof some urticaria) \n2. Insect bite reactions \n3. The early phases of hullous pemphigoid \nC. Urticaria can be distinguished from all of the above disorders \nbecause it is the only one with lesions that last < 24 hours. \nD. A careful history, including revieof medications, recent \na:po.sw:es, and food ingestion, is the most important aspect of \nthe evaluation to determine a cause. \nE. Laboratory evaluation is sometime& Wldertaken in cases of \nchronic urticar.ia, but studies have shown that relevant results \nare so rarely found without other symptoms that this approach \nis discouraged. \nTreatment \nA. Identification of the inciting agent (medication, supplement, \ninfection) is paramount and should be addressed as the first \nstep in management. \nB. Antihistamines are the mainstay of therapy. H 1-blockers \nshould be given on a regular dosing schedule until the erup-\ntion is suppressed and then tapered gradually to prevent \nrebound flare. \nC. Combinations of different H1 blockers can be effective when a \nsingle agent is inadequate. \nD. Addition ofH2-blockcrs may be hdpful in refractory cases. \n\nF'tgure29-15. Purpura. \nPurpura/Petechiae \nTextbook Pr:ae.ntadon \nPurpura. and petechiae arc seen in patients with blec:ding dfathe-\nses or vascular damage. Petechiae arc capillary hemorrhages that \npresent as nonblanching, pinpoint, red spots over dependent \nbody pans, most commonly the lower extremities. They are often \nassociated with severe thrombocytopenia. Purpura are larger hem-\norrhages into the skin. Purpura are associated with a variety of \nlife-threatening diseases, such as vasculitis and sepsis. \nDisease Higblights \nA. Description of the lesion: pctedtlac are red, blue or purple, \nnonblanch.ing, pinpoint spots. Purpura. uc larger (up to \nseveral centimeters) nonblancbing macules, papules, or \nplaques that may or may not be palpable (Figure 29-15). \nB. Both purpura and petechiae are, to some degree, nonblanch-\ning (ie, the color cannot be compressed out of the lesion \nby pmsme). \nC. The shape of these lesions is variable, ranging from stdlatc \nto round or oval or targctoid to rctifurm (net.like). \nD. The color, texture, and configuration of these lesions \nwill be helpful in constructing a differential diagnosis of \nthe cause. \nE. The differential diagnosis of purpura/petcch.iac is vast, \nand many classification schemes have been proposed. The \nnm step is to differentiate ecchymoses from purpma. and \npctechiae. \nR Ecchy.moses \nI. Ecchymoses arc the most common form of hemorrhagc in \nthe skin. \n2. They arc typically induced by trauma and, therefore. \narc seen on trauma-prone sites, such as the dorsal hand, \nforearm, lateral thigh, and shin. \n3. The shape of cccbymoses tends to be geometric \n(rectangular) or linear because they arc induced by an \nexternal force. \n4. Predisposing fu:tors to cccbymoses include weakening of \nthe dermal structure secondary to age, corticosteroid use, \nsolar damage, and vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) as well as \ncoagulation defects. \nRASH I 515 \nG. Petechiae are most commonly associated with thrombocytopenia. \nH. Purpura \nI. Like petechiae, purpura signify hemorrhage into the skin. \n2. The hcmorrhage may \na. Be simple cxtravasation through leaky vessel walls. \nb. Be accompanied by inflamma.tlon that is damaging \nvessel walls. (The.5e lesions are often partially blanching \nbecause the inBammatory component blanches while \nthe hemorrhagi.c component does not.) \ne. Be the result of occlusion of a vessel tea.ding to ischemic \ndamage to the skin. \n3. The degree to which purpuric lesions are palpable is helpful \ndiagnostically. \n&. Nonpalpable bemorrhagc in the skin is most \nconcerning for thrombocytopenia or abnormal platelet \nfunction. \nb. Extravasation of blood alone into deep tissue layers can \nproduce a nodule (such as occurs with a hematoma). \nc. Edema associated with the vessel injury (such as in \ncases of inflanunatory vasculitis) may cause a palpable \nlesion. \n(1) Palpable purpura can be a sign of serious, \npotentially life-threatening, illness (eg.. Rocky \nMountain spotted fever, acute meningococcemia, \ndisseminated gonococcal infu:tion). \n(2) Evaluation should include tests for 'YlLSCUlitis and, \nin the right setting, infectious causes (possibly \nincluding empiric treatment). \nEvideace-Bucd Diagnosis \nA. An evaluation of dotting (platelet number, function, and \n.mcaslll'CS of coagulation) is indicated to deter.mine whether \npurpura and pctechiae are symptoms of a coagulopathy, \nthrombocytopenia, or vasculitis. \nB. A sk:in biopsy can be helpful in determining \nI. The size and location of affected vessels within the dermal \nand subcutaneous tissues \n2. The d.cgrei: and character of associated infla.cnmation \n3. The type of vessel damage (leukocytoclastic or \ngranulomatous) \n4. The presence and character of any occlusions within vessels \n(organisms, calcium, fibrin) \nC. Immunofluoresccnce studies ofhistologic specimens can be \nhelpful in identifying antibody and complement deposits on \nvessels walls. \nTteatme.nt \nA. Treatment is directed toward management of the underlying \ncause of the vessel damage. \nB. Supponive therapy includes local wound care and prevention \nof secondary infection. \nSkin Canc:et \nThere arc innwncrable spccifu: forms of skin cancer, de.riving from \nall of the structures of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. In addi-\ntion, many cancers will metastasize to the skin. The 3 most com-\nmon primary skin cancers are basal cell carcinoma, squamocell. \ncarcinoma, and mdanoma. \n\n516 I CHAPTER29 \n1. Basal Cell Carcinoma \nTmbook Presentation \nBasal cell carcinoma most commonly presents as a flcsh-colorcd, \nmnsluccnt, or slightly red papulc or nodule, classically displaying \na rolled border. It most comm.only presents on the head or neck of \nolder adults. \nDiseae Highlights \nA. Description oflesion: the typical lesion is a Besh-colored. \ntranslucent, or slightly red papule or nodule, classically \ndisplaying a rolled border (Figure 29-16). \nI. Lesions are often friable, bleeding easily and developing \ncrust. Telangiecwias on the swface can be a helpful sign. \n2. Large tumors can be foe.ally destructive. \nB. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tum.or in \nhwnans. \nC. Lesions arc typically asymptomatic except fur the ob.,c,rvation \nof easy bleeding from a site. \nI. Only rarely .is pain associated. \n.2. Metastasis from a basal cell carcinoma is rare. \nD. Individuals at risk are adults with fair hair and eyes, easy \nfreckling.. and propensity for sunburn. \nI. Patients with skin of color are less likely to be affected. \n2. Men and women are about equally affected. \nFigure 2t-16. Basal cell carcinoma. {Used with pennission from \nDr. Anne E. Laumann.) \n3. Exposure to UV light has long been believed to play a \ncausative role in the development of this cumor, although \nthe exact mechanism is not clear. Several genetic mutlltions \nhave been isolated in basal cell carcinoma and may serve as \ntargets fur therapeutics. \n4. Chronic wounds and sites of inflammation, as well as, \nimmunosuppression can predispose to c:levdopmcnt of this \ntwnor. \n5. Exposun: to mcnic is aJlother risk factor fur basal cell \ncarcinoma. \nE. The head and neck arc the most common sites affected with \nthis tumor. \nI. Only 10-15% of twnors dcvdop on sun-protected. skin. \n.2. The nose is the most common site, accounting for 20-30% \nof all cases. \nR Basal cell carcinoma is likely derived from the hair follicle. The \nname implies a resemblance of the tumor cells to the basal \ncells of the epidermis, although this is not bclic:vcd to be their \nderivation. \nG. Patients have up to a 45% risk of devl:loping subsequent basal \ncell carcinomas in the 5 years after initial diagnosis. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nHistologic evaluation of affected. tissue is the gold standard for \ndiagnosis. \nTreatment \nA. The goal of therapy is to eliminate the tlUn.Or and prevent local \ntis.sue destruction. Numerous methods are available to accom-\nplish this goal, and selection depends on tumor si7.e, type, and \nlocation, patient characteristics, and patient preferences. \nB. 5-year recurrence rates vary by treatment modality. The lowest \nrecurrence rate is achieved with Mohs micrographic surgery. \n1. This method involves excision of the visible tumor, \nfollowed by microscopic evaluation of fr<nen tissue sections \nto visualize tumor margins and repeat local excision until \nall margins arc clear of rumor. \n2. The technique allows for maximal tissue sparing while \nensuring complete eradication of tumor. \nC. Follow-up of patients for recurrent or subsequent tumors is \ncritical. \n2. Squamous Cell Carcinoma \nTc::ubook Presentation \nSquamous cell carcinoma most commonly pre&ents as a firm but \nsomewhat indistinct nodule or plaque. It may evolve from actinic \nkeratoses on the sun-exposed skin of middle-aged people. \nDisease Higblighu \nA. Description oflesion: lesions are firm but somewhat indistinct \nnodules or plaques that may arise from an in situ carcinoma or \nin nonnal skin. Turners may become ulcerated. or bleed easily \nand become crusted. (Figure 29-17). \nI. The surface may be smooth, vcrrucous, or papillomatous, \nwith or without scaling . \n.2. Fixation to underlying structures develops as the lesion \ninvades Joe.ally. \n3. In siru lesions tend to be sharply demarcated. crythematous \nscaling plaques. \n\nFigure 29-17. Squamous cell carcinoma. {Used with permission \nfrom Dr. Anne E. Laumann.) \nB. This tumor most commonly affects fair-skinned individuals \nwith cxa:ssive sun exposure. \nI. May evolve from actinic keratoscs on sun-exposed skin in \nthese patients. \n2. UV radiation is a major risk factor for the development of \nthistumor. \n3. Additional predisposing f.i.c1Drs include \na. Radiation therapy \nb. Chronic SQ1' formation \nc. Chemical carcinogens, such as hydrocarbons \ncl. Viral exposures \ne. Thermal exposures \n Arsenic \ng. Long-term immunosuppte.5$ion (such as in kidney \ntransplant recipients). \nC. Squamous cell carcinoma does carry a risk of local recurrence \nand metastasis. \nI. The risk oflocal recurrence is around 3%. \n2. Metastasis is less common but can reach 10% in patients \nwith the thickc.st lesions. \n3. Other factors, such as location (ears) and immunosuppres-\nsion, are also associated with higher risk of metastasis. \nD. Inuaoral squamous cell carcinoma is predominantly a disease \nof adult men. \nI. Risk fu:tors are alcohol and tobacco use as well as HPV \ninfection. \n2. When detected in the early asymptomatic stage, these \ncancct3 are easily curable. \nE. Incidence increases with age and Wiies with geographic \nlocation, ethnicity, and behavior patterns. \nEvidence-Buecl Diagnosis \nA. Histologic evaluation of affected tissue is the gold standard for \ndiagnosis. \nB. A high indct of suspicion may be necessary to recogn.i7.C a \npotential tumor when its appearance or location is unusual. \nRASH I 517 \nFor example, the verrucous form of squamous cell carcinoma \ncan be mistaken for a wart. \nTteatment \nA. The goal of treatment is eradication of the tumor while pro-\nducing the least disability and dy:sfunction for the patient. \nB. Careful evaluation for the presence of metastatic disease is \nparamount. This may include lymph node dissection in some \ninstances. \nC. Multiple destruction modalities are available and arc selected \nbased on sll:c, shape, and location of the nunor as well as \npatient preferences. These modalities include, but arc not \nlimited to \nI. Surgical excision \n2. Mohs micrographic surgery \n3. EJectrosurgery \n4. Radiation therapy \nS. Local immunotherapy \nD. Wide destruction of these tumors usually results in cure as \nsquamous cell carcinomas groby direct extension. However, \nresidual tumor can invade and extend along peripheral nerves, \noccasionally resulting in a deep recurrence. \nE. A large percentage of squamous cell carcinomas could be \nprevented by avoidance of cx:cessive solar exposure. Routine \nscreening for tumors, especially in high-risk patients, is \nimperative. \n3.Melanoma \nTextbook Piese.atation \nMelanoma typically presents as a dark brown or black macule or \npapulc in a middle-aged person. The lesion has pigment variation \nthroughout and irregular borders. \nDiacue Higblights \nA. Description oflesion: the most common type of melanoma is \nsupcrlkiaJ. spreading (Figure 29~ 18). \nI. These tumors may present as a dark brown to bla.ck macule \nor thin plaque, typically with pigment variation throughout \nand irregular borders. \n2. With growth, the surfue becomes glossy. \n3. The most common location of supe.rflcial spreading \nmelanomas is on the upper back in males and the leg \nin females. \nB. These cancers arc most commonly diagnosed in the fourth \nand fifth decades oflifc. \nC. Melanoma may arise in a preexisting mdanocytic ncvus or \ndenovo. \nD. Multiple subtypes exist, including lentigo maligna melanoma. \nsuperficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral \nlentiginous melanoma, and amclanotic melanoma, among \nothers. \nI. Nodular mdanoma is the second most common type of \nmelanoma. \na. Presents most often on the head, ncclc. or trunk. \nb. These tumors evolve rapidly over months. \nc. They appear as a blue-black, reddish, purplish, or even a \nnonpigmented papule or nodule. \n\n518 I CHAPTER29 \nFlgur. 29-18. Malignant melanoma. (Used with pennission \nfrom Dr. Anne E. Laumann.) \n2. Aaal lentiginous mdanoma is the predominant type of \nmdanoma seen in the more pigmented races, such as \nAfricans, Asians, and Indians. \na. Acral lentiginou.s mdanoma occurs on the palms and \nsoles and beneath the nail plate. \nb. Diagnosis of these lesions is often ddayed.; therefore, \nthey are often of a more advanced stage at diagnosis. \nc. Affected individuals tend to be older. \n3. Lentigo maligna mdanoma is a rare type of melanoma \nfound predominantly in the dderly on the sun-exposed \nportions of the head and neck. \na. The tumor is usually Sat. with irregular borders and a \ndiameter of several centimeters. \nb. Color varies throughout from tan to brown to black \nand purple and blue. \nE. Mdanoma is a tumor of melanocytes. \n1. Benign pigmented nevi are composed of altered \nmdanocytes, termed \"nevomelanocytes.\" \n2. Malignant transformation of melanocytes and \nnevomdanocytes can result in melanoma, arising de novo \nfrom normal skin, or from a preexisting nevomelanocytic \nlesion (nevus or mole). \nF. The incidence of cutaneous mdanoma is increasing steadily in \nthe United States. \n1. In 1935, the lifetime risk of an American devdoping \nmdanoma was 1in1500 individuals, whereas in 2016 the \nlifetime risk of being diagnosed with invasive or in-situ \nmelanoma was 1 in 28. \n2. An estimated 96,480 Americans will be diagnosed with \nmelanoma in 2097, and 7230 will die of the disease. \n3. There has been a substantial rise in overall 5-~ survival \nin patients with mdanoma since the 1970s. \na. The improved survival may be due to earlier diagnosis as \nwdl as improved treatment and surgical techniques. \nb. The rising incidence and improved outcomes raise the \npossibility of overdiagnosis. \nG. Whites are 26 times more likely to devdop melanoma than \nblacks. Worldwide, whites have the highest risk of developing \nmelanoma, and Asian populations have the lowest risk. \nH. Epidemiologic studies strongly SU88Cst that sun exposure is a \nmajor risk fu:tor for the devdopment of cutaneous mdanoma \nin the light-skinned populations. \n1. Intense intermittent episodes of sun exposure before \n18 years of age are thought to engender the highest risk \nin swceptible populations. \n2. Phcnot.ypic features have been associated with increased \nrisk for cutaneous melanoma: light skin pigmentation, ease \nof sWl bm.lling, blond or red hair, promi.llent freddi.llg. and \nblue or gteen eyes. \nL Familial melanoma accounts for 8-12% of cases. Those with \nat least 2 fun-degree relatives with a history of mclalloma arc \nat particularly high risk. \nJ. Dy:splastic nevi (clinically atypical appearing nevi) arc thought \nto be markers of an individual with an increased risk of devel~ \noping cuW'l.COus mdanoma. \n1. The number of .llcM on the body has been din:ctly correlated. \nwith the magnitude of melanoma risk. \n2. .About one-third of mdanomas have been associated with \nan underlying nevus. \nK. Recurrences of disease generally occur in a stepwise manner, \n.first locally. then i.ll regional lymph nodes, a.lld lastly as dista.llt \nmetast:ase8. \nEvidenf.C-Basecl Diagnosis \nA. An e:u:isional bioJ15Y is the prefened method for obtaining \ntissue for diagnosis. This pmerves the extent of the primary \ntumor and all associated histologic features without disrupting \nthe lymphatic architecture. \nB. Full-thickness incisional or punch biopsies of lesions too \nlarge to excise fully or in anatomically sensitive locations are \nsatisf.tcto.ry. \nC. The histologic diagnosis of melanoma is based on a constella-\ntion of features; no single feature is diagnostic. Both cytologic \nand architectural features are evaluated. \nD. The staging system for melanoma follows the tumor, node, \nmetastasis (TNM) system, which relies on assessment of the \nprimary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and the presence or \nabsence of diswit metastases. Assessment of the primary \nnun.or focuses on the histologic tumor thickness and presence \nof ulceration as the most important initial variables. \n'.neatment \nA. Management of cutaneous melanoma is guided by stage of \ndisease. Wide c:xcis.ion of tum.ors is the general rule. \nB. Sentinel lymph node mapping may be beneficial diagnostically \nin more advanced stages, decreasing the complications associ~ \natcd with full lymph node dissections. \nC. Adjuwnt treatment options for adwnccd mgc disease include \n\n1. Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors \n(pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab) and targeted \ntherapy (inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK genes) are \nfirst line. \n2. Radiation therapy may have a palliative role for \nsymptomatic localized areas of disease. \n3. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been shown to improve \noverall survival in patients with advanced melanoma. \nD. Follow-up of melanoma patients is critical to detect recur-\nrences as well as neprimary tumors and to provide ongoing \neducation. \nE. Melanoma prevention strategies focus on education about the \nrisks of W exposure via sunlight or tanning machines, sun \nprotection guidelines, and the importance of routine self-skin \nexams. \n1. Early detection is important for improving outcomes. \n2. Patients should be instructed on the importance of their \nown skin examination and what constitutes a worrisome \nmole, easily remembered by the ABCDEs of mole \nevaluation. \na. A: asymmetry \nb.

Nall, MD \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. W is a 30-year-old man who complains of having a sore \nthroat for 3 days. \n~~ \nWhat fs the differential diagnosis of a sons \n~JI\"' throat? Howould you frame the differential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nSore throat is a common condition seen in outpatient clinical \npractice. This chapter focuses on patients who have acute onset of \nsore throat. Infectious diseases are the cause of acute sore throat in \nthe overwhdming majority of patients. Patients with chronic sore \nthroat, those who do not have signs of infection, or those who do \nnot respond to treatment should be evaluated for noninfectious \ncauses of sore throat. \nA useful framework fur the differential diagnosis of acute sore \nthroat is shown bdow. This framework divides the diagnoses into \nthose caused by infection (bacterial and viral) and those caused by \nnoninfectlous processes. Viral respiratory infections are the most \ncommon cause of infectious pharyngitis with the common cold \ncaused by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses accounting fur at least \n25% of cases. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) is \nthe most common cause of acute bacterial pharyngitis, account-\ning fur 5-15% of sore throats in adults and 20-30% in children. \nTable 30-1 shows the differential diagnosis with the estimated per-\ncentage of cases of sore throat and the associated clinical syndrome. \nA. Infectious causes of sore throat \n1. Viruses \na. Rhinovirus \nb. Coronavirus \nc. Adenovirus \nd. Herpes simplex virus (HSY) 1 and 2 \ne. Influenza A and B \nf. Parainfluenza virus \ng. Epstein-Barr virus (EBY) \nh. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) \ni. Human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 \nj. HN \n2. Bacteria \na. GABHS \nb. Fusobaamum necrophorum \nc. Group C beta-hemolytic streptococci \nd. Ndssma gono\"hoeae \ne. Corynebaamum diphthmae \n Mycoplasma pneumoniae \ng. Chlamydophila pneumoniae \nB. Noninfectious causes of sore throat \n1. Persistent cough \n2. Postnasal drip \n3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease \n4. Acute thyroiditis \n5. Neoplasm \n6. Allergies \n7. Smoking \nClinically, the primary goal when seeing a patient with acute, \nprobably infectious sore throat is to identify and treat patients with \nGABHS pharyngitis in order to prevent suppurative (ie, peritonsil-\nlar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, otitis media) and nonsuppura-\ntive (ie, acute rheumatic fever) complications. The secondary goal \nis to diagnose the less common bacterial infections (F necrophorum, \nN gono\"hoeae) that need to be treated. In addition, diagnosing the \nnonbacterial pathogens, such as primary HIY. influenza A and B, \nand mononucleosis is important for both therapeutic and prog-\nnostic reasons. Pivotal points in the evaluation of these patients, \ntherefore, include the presence of unilateral symptoms (suggesting \nabscess formation or fusobacterium infection). the presence of \nexudate (suggestive of GABHS), risk factors for sexually transmit-\nted infections and HIY. or signs and symptoms of influenza or \nmononucleosis. \n\nMr. W's symptoms started abruptly 3 days ago when sore \nthroat, pain with swallowing, fever, and headaches devel-\noped. He denies symptoms of cough, coryza, or rhinorrhea. \n~ \nAt this point, what is the leading hypothesis, \n1~JI\"' what are the active alternatlvee, and le \nthere a mu5t not m f55 dfag no5l51 Given thl5 \ndifferential dlagnoele, what teet9 ehould '7e \nordered? \nPRIORITIZING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe pivotal points in Mr. W's history include his sudden onset \nof sore throat, fever, and headache. These symptoms suggest an \ninfectious cause of sore throat. The differential diagnosis includes \n\n522 I CHAPTER 30 \nTable 30-1.

In general, patients with viral pharyngitis \nhave cough, coryza, rhinorrhea, and hoarseness, while those with \nbacterial pharyngitis or mononucleosis have fever, tender anterior \ncervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar erythema with or without \ntonsillar swelling and exudates. \nInfluenza can cause fevers and throat pain but is usually asso-\nciated with cough and myalgias. Infectious mononucleosis, which \nis most often caused by EBY, can also cause sore throat and fever \nbut most often occurs in persons between the ages of 1 S and \n24 years and is associated with malaise and marked adenopathy. \nPrimary HIV infection can present with nonspeciflc symptoms of \npharyngitis, fever, mucocutaneous ulcers, adenopathy, and fatigue \nand should also be considered in people with high-risk behaviors. \nTable 30-2 lists the differential diagnosis for Mr. W. \nTable 30-2.

Examination of the throat reveals edema \nand erythema of the posterior pharynx and tonsils are often cov-\nered with gray-white exudates. The anterior cervical lymph nodes \n\nare tender. Gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and \nabdominal pain may also be present, especially in children. \nDisease Higbllghts \nA. GABHS is generally suspected when fever and throat pain are \npresent and cough, coryza, and rhinorrhea are absent. \nB. Untreated GABHS typically lasts 8--10 days. Patients are \ninfectious during the acute illness and for up to 1 week \nafterward. \nC. GABHS infection is associated with 2 important postinfectious \nsyndromes. \n1. Acute rheumatic fever \na. Presents 1-5 weeks after throat infection \nb. Clinical diagnosis based on Jones criteria (2 major or \n1 major and 2 minor) \n(1) Major: Carditis, arthritis, chorea, subcutaneous \nnodules, erythema marginatum \n(2) Minor: Fever, arthralgia, elevated acute phase \nreactants, prolonged PR interval on ECG \nc. Due to aggressive treatment of GABHS, acute \nrheumatic fever is uncommon in the developed \nworld (but still common in developing nations). \nAnnual incidence in the United States is 1/1,000,000 \npopulation. \n2. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis \na. Presents 1-2 weeks after GABHS pharyngitis \nb. Imponant findings are edema, hematuria, proteinuria, \nand hypenension \nEvidence-Bued Diagnosis \nA. Clinical diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis \n1. Pretest probability \na. The pretest probability of a patient having GABHS \npharyngitis is based primarily on the patient's age, \nclinical setting, and season. \nb. The pretest probability of strep throat in the adult \nclinic-based population is 5-10%. \nc. Because strep throat is more common in aurumn and \nwinter, it may be appropriate to adjust this estimate \nupward or downward according to season. \n2. Clinical findings and clinical decision rules \na. The modified Centor score, one of the best validated \nclinical decision rules, assigns 1 point for each of the \nfollowing findings: tonsillar exudates, swollen tender \nanterior cervical nodes, absence of cough, history of \nfever, and age < 15 years. One point is subtracted for \nage over 45 and older. \nb. The likelihood ratios and posttest probabilities given a \npretest probability of 10% are given in Table 30-3. \nB. Laboratory diagnosis \n1. Throat culture \na. A single swab throat culture has a sensitivity of \napproximately 90-95% and specificity of95-99%. \nb. The major disadvantage of throat cultures is the 24- to \n72-hour delay in obtaining results. \n2. Rapid antigen detection test (RADT) \na. Results from RADTs are available within a feminutes \nSORETHROAT I 523 \nTable 30-3.

Sensitivity ranges from 70% to 90% when compared \nwith throat culture with sensitivities in actual practice \nbeing toward the lower end of this range. \nc. Specificity for RADTs ranges from 90% to 100%. \nC. Integrated use of clinical decision rules and laboratory methods \n1. Generally, clinicians use the results of a clinical decision \nrules to determine which patients require further testing. \n2. Patients at the lowest risk (modified Centor score 0-1, lo\npretest probability) receive no testing. \n3. Patients at higher risk (modified Centor score 2-3, posttest \nprobability 5-50%) should receive a RADT or throat \nculture with treatment based on result. \n4, Patients at the highest risk (modified Centor score 4, \nposttest probability> 50%) should receive a RADT or \nthroat culture with treatment based on the result. Some \nprofessional societies recommend empiric treatment with \na modified Centor score of 4. \n5. Given the sensitivity of RADT and the exceptionally lo\nrisk of acute rheumatic fever in adults, a throat culture is \nnot necessary when an RADT is negative. (In children and \nadolescents, a negative RADT should be verified by throat \nculture.) \n6. Positive RADTs do not require back up with a culture \nbecause they are highly specific. \nTreatment \nA. Patients with GABHS pharyngitis should be treated with \nappropriate antibiotic therapy to prevent development of \nacute rheumatic fever. \n1. Penicillin and amoxicillin are the first-line antibiotics given \ntheir narrospectrum of activity and modest cost. \n2. For patients with an allergy to penicillin, choices \ninclude first-generation cephalosporins, clindarnycin, \nclarithromycin, or azithromycin. \nB. Treatment decreases severity of symptoms, reduces risk of \ntransmission, and reduces the likelihood of suppurative \ncomplications and acute rheumatic fever. \nC. Antibiotic therapy decreases the risk of acute rheumatic fever \nby73%. \nD. Clinical improvement within 48 hours is expected; patients \nwho do not improve should be reevaluated. \nE. Tonsillectomy is only indicated fur patients with 4 or more \nepisodes of severe pharyngitis in a year. \n\n524 I CHAPTER 30 \nAny patient with documented GABHS phar-\nyngitis who does not improve within 48 hours \nof treatment with an appropriate course of \nantibiotics should be reevaluated. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr. W has 3 points on the modified Centor score (fever, \nexudate, and al:lsence of cough). A RADT test Is performed. \nHave you crosead a dlagn09tlc; thre!lhold \nfor the leading hypothesis? Have you ruled \nout the active altsmativse? Do other tsete \nneed to be done to exclude the altsmatfve \ndiagnosae? \nGiven a modified Centor score of 3, the patient's risk of having \nGABHS is 28-35%. In this group of patients, the results of a \nRADT will be very hdpful, essentially ruling out or ruling in dis-\nease. Mr. W has no risk factors for HIV. He has no symptoms of \nfatigue, malaise, or cough, making influenza a less likdy diagnosis. \nHe reports no fatigue or lymphadenopathy and is older than \nthe typical patient with mononucleosis, making this diagnosis \nless likdy. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Influenza \nSee discussion in Chapter 10, Cough, Fever, and Respiratory \nInfections. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Infectious \nMononucleosis \nTextbook Presentation \nInfectious mononucleosis typically presents with a prodrome \nof fever, malaise, chills, and sweats. The illness then progresses \nto the classic triad of severe sore throat, fever (38-40C), and \nlymphadenopathy. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Infectious mononucleosis is most common in patients \n15-24 years of age (6 to 8 cases/1000 person-years). It is \nuncommon in adults, accounting for < 2% of pharyngitis \nin patients over 40 years of age. \nB. Infectious mononucleosis is most often caused by EBY \n(the focus of this discussion) but can be caused by CMV \norHHY6. \nC. EBY is spread in saliva. \n1. May be shed in salivary secretions for many weeks \n2. As many as 20% of healthy, previously infected adults \nintermittently shed virus for decades. \nD. Most people are infected with EBY during childhood and the \ntypical childhood infection is subclinical. Less than 10% of \nchildren exhibit symptoms. \nE. Approximately 90% of adults are EBY seropositive. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \nTable30-4.

The earliest symptoms of EBY are fever, malaise, chills, and \nsweats. \n2. These symptoms then progress to the classic triad of severe \nsore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy. \nB. Physical exam \n1. Common findings include enlarged tonsils; pharyngeal \nerythema; thick, coating, pharyngeal exudate; palatal \npetechiae; and tender anterior and/or posterior cervical \nadenopathy. Posterior cervical adenopathy is quite specific \nfor EBY. \n2. Table 30-4 lists test characteristics for findings suggestive \nof EBY. \n3. Rash is uncommon in infectious mononucleosis unless \nthere is antibiotic exposure. \na. 5-10% of patients have a rash of varying morphology \nb. 27-69% of patients with infectious mononucleosis who \nare treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop a rash. \nInfectious mononucleosis is character-\nized by a triad of fever, sore throat, and \nlymphadenopathy. \nC. Laboratory testing \n1. The heterophile antibody test {Monospot test) is highly \nspecific for EBY. \na. Specificity, 99% \nb. Sensitivity \n(1) False-negative rate in first week is as high as 25%. \n(2) 5-10% in second week \n(3) 5% in third week of illness \n2. Serum IgM antibody to the EBY viral capsid antigen \na.

This test is useful in patients with suspected infectious \nmononucleosis who have negative Monospot. \n\n3. Other tests \na. Lymphocytosis and the presence of atypical lymphocytes \nare diagnostically useful. \n(1) Lymphocytosis of> 50% on peripheral smear: \nsensitivity, 66%; specificity, 84% \n(2) Atypical lymphocytes > 10% of total lymphocytes: \nsensitivity, 75%; specificity, 92% \n(3) Combination of both lymphocytosis > 50% and \natypical lymphocytes > 10%: sensitivity, 43%; \nspecificity, 99%; LR+, 54; LR-, 0.58 \nb. Elevated aminottansferases are seen in the majority of \npatients. \nTreatment \nA. Infectious mononucleosis is a sdf-limited illness; most symptoms \nresolve within 3 weeks. \nB. Symptomatic treatment, including hydration, antipyretics, \nanalgesics, and rest, remains the mainstay of care. \nC. Corticosteroids, acyclovir, and antihistamines are not recom-\nmended for routine treatment of infectious mononucleosis. \n1. Acyclovir does decrease viral shedding but does not alter \nthe clinical course. \n2. Corticosteroids are indicated for patients with impending \nairway compromise. \nD. Splenomegaly may persist after symptoms resolve. Patients \nshould avoid heavy lifting and contact sports for 4 weeks. \nE. Potential complications are rare but include the following: \n1. Splenic ruprure \na. Rare but potentially life-threatening complication \nb. Estimated incidence is 1-2 cases/1000 \n2. Airway obstruction \n3. Pneumonitis \n4. Hematologic complications \na.

Optic neuritis \ng. Guillain-Barr~ syndrome \nAlternative Diagnosis: Primary HIV Infection -\nAcute Retroviral Syndrome \nTatbook Presentation \nSymptoms of acute retroviral syndrome are generally nonspeciflc \nand resolve spontaneously without treatment. The most common \nfindings are fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, rash, myalgia/ \narthralgia, headache, and mucocutaneous ulcers. \nDisease Highlights \nA. The highest risk populations for HN infection are: \nSORETHROAT I 525 \n1. Men who have sex with men \n2. Injection drug users \n3. Commercial sex workers \n4. People with high number of sexual partners with \ninconsistent condom use \nB. Transmission of HIV is common in the first 3 months of an \ninfection. \n1. This is a period of high viral load. \n2. There are high levds of virus in blood and genital \nsecretions. \n3. Patients often do not knothey are infected. \n4. Early diagnosis is thus important to decrease rates of \ntransmission. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Clinical presentation \n1. The usual lag between exposure to HN and development \nof symptoms is 2-4 weeks. \n2. 50-90% patients with acute HN infection experience \nsymptoms of acute retroviral syndrome. \n3. Symptoms seen in over 50% of patients with symptomatic \nacute retroviral syndrome are: \na. Fever \nb. Fatigue \nc. Rash \nd. Headache \ne. Lymphadenopathy \nf. Pharyngitis \ng. Myalgia or arthralgia \nh. Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea \ni. Weight loss \n4. Painful mucocutaneous ulcerations \na. Less common but distinctive manifestation of the \nsyndrome \nb. Often shalloand sharply demarcated \nc. Can involve the oral mucosa, anus, penis, or esophagus \n5. Table 30-5 lists test characteristics for findings suggestive of \nacute HN infection. \nB. Laboratory testing \n1. Laboratory testing is appropriate for patients in \nwhom there is a clinical suspicion for acute retroviral \nsyndrome. \nTable30-5.

Testing should indude: \na. Founh-generation HIV Immunoassay \n(1) HN can be detected as early as 18 days after \ninfection. \n(2) Older HN antibody tests (ELISA and Western blot) \nhave a longer windoperiod. \n(3) Sensitivity, 99-100% \n(4) Specificity, 98-100% \nb. HIV viral load assay \n(1) HIV virus can typically be detected 11 days after \ninfection. \n(2) Patients with acute retroviral syndrome typically \nhave high viral loads of> 100,000 copies/mL. \n(3) False-positive result should be suspected if viral load \nis < 10,000 copies/mL. \n(4) Sensitivity, 95-98% \nc. Genotype resistance testing is recommended in all \npatients with primary HN infection, since transmission \nof drug-resistant HIV strains has been documented. \nBecause HN antigen/antibody tests may be \nnegative at the time of acute seroconversion, \nan HN viral load assay should always be sent \nwhen this diagnosis is being considered. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMs.Lis a 25-year-old woman with no significant past med-\nic.al history in whom sore throat, fever, and malaise devel-\noped 7 days ago. She complains of severe throat pain, more \npronounced on the right. and right ear pain. She reports \nsevere pain with swallowing. She also reports that for the \npast day she has not been able to open her mouth widely. \n~\"' At this point, what ie the leading hypotheeie, \n1~r what are the active alternatlwse, and le \ntheN a must not miss diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential dlagnoel9, what teete should be \nordered? \nPRIORITIZING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe pivotal points, in this case, are the unilateral nature of the \nthroat pain as well as the odynophagia and trismus. This presenta-\ntion suggests a peritonsillar abscess, classically referred to as quinsy. \nPeritonsillar abscesses generally form in the area of the soft palate, \njust above the superior pole of the tonsil. \nPeritonsillar abscess is a must not miss diagnosis because if left \nuntreated, it may progress to airway obstruction, abscess rupture, \nor septic necrosis. Other important diagnoses to consider in this \ncase would be retropharyngeal abscess or epiglottitis. Lemierre \ndisease, a rare disease caused by F necrophorum, must also be con-\nsidered. Table 30-6 lists the differential diagnosis. \nTreatment \nA. Antiretroviral therapy is recommended for all individuals \nwith HN; this includes patients with acute and early HIV \ninfection. \nB. Referral to an HN specialist is recommended if the provider is \nnot trained in management of HIV. \nC. Genotypic drug resistance testing should be performed before \ninitiation of antiretroviral therapy to guide the selection of the \nregimen. \nD. Patients starting antiretroviral therapy should understand the \nimportance of adherence and be ready to start therapy. \nE. Symptoms of the acute retroviral syndrome should be managed \nsupportively and other sexually transmitted infections should \nbe ruled out. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nA RADT test Is performed and Is posit ive. Mr. W has no \nallergies to .antibiotics and he is t reated wit h penicillin \n500 mg twice daily for 10 days. Two days after startitie \ntreatment. he reports improvement in symptoms. \nTable 30-6.

The lung exam was \nnorm a 1 and no stridor was noted. \n:-:.;;,.~ le the clinlcal Information sufficient to make a \n~JI\"\" dlagnoslsi' lf not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Peritonsillar Abscess \nTextbook Presentation \nThe typical clinical presentation of peritonsillar abscess is a severe \nunilateral sore throat associated with fever and a muffied \"hot \npotato\" voice. Malaise, dysphagia, and oralgia are also often present. \nSwallowing is painful, which sometimes leads to pooling of saliva \nor drooling. Trismus, difficulty opening the mouth because of \npain from the inflammation, may be present. The oropharyngeal \nexam reveals an extremdy swollen tonsil with the displacement \nof the uvula to the unaffected side and a bulging soft palate on \nthe affected side. The patient may have markedly tender cervical \nlymphadenitis on the affected side. \nDisease Highlights \nA. A peritonsillar abscess usually begins as acute, exudative \ntonsillitis that progresses to cellulitis and eventually to abscess \nformation. The abscess may occur without preceding infection \nvia obstruction of the Weber glands, a group of salivary glands \nin the soft palate. \nB. It is the most common deep infection of head and neck, \naccounting for approxirnatdy 30% of abscesses of the head \nand neck. \nC. Occurs primarily in young adults between the ages of 20 and \n40 years \nD. Peritonsillar abscesses are polymicrobial. Common organisms \ninclude: \n1. Aerobic bacteria \na. Group A streptococci \nb. Staphylococcus aureus \nc. Haemophilus influenzae \n2. Anaerobic bacteria \na. Fusobacttrium \nb. Peptostrtptococcus \nc. Pigmented Prtvotella species \nd. Vtillonella \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess can be made clinically \nwithout laboratory data or imaging in patients with a typical \npresentation \n1. Symptoms \na. Fever \nb. Malaise \nSORETHROAT I 527 \nc. Severe sore throat {usually asymmetric) \nd. Dysphagia \ne. Ipsilateral oralgia \n2. Signs \na. Erythematous, swollen soft palate with uvula deviation \nand an enlarged tonsil \nb. Trismus (present in nearly 66% of patients with \nperitonsillar abscesses) \nc. Drooling \nd. Muffled \"hot potato\" voice \ne. Rancid or fetor breath \n Cervical lymphadenitis \nB. Culture of pus from abscess drainage can confirm the diagnosis. \nThe rate of culture positivity from peritonsillar abscess in the \nliterature ranges from< 50% to 100%. \nC. Laboratory evaluation \n1. Laboratory evaluation is not necessary to make the diagnosis \nbut may hdp gauge the levd of illness and direct therapy. \n2. Testing usually includes: \na. Complete blood count \nb. Routine throat culture for group A streptococci \nc. Gram stain, culture, and susceptibility testing of abscess \nfluid, especially in patients with persistent infection or \ndiabetes or in those who are immunocompromised. \nD. Imaging \n1. Generally not necessary to make a diagnosis but may be \nconsidered in the following cases: \na. Suspected spread beyond peritonsillar space \nb. Inability to successfully examine the pharynx because \noftrismus \nc. Monitoring patients unresponsive to initial treatment \nwith antibiotics and drainage \n2. The preferred imaging modality is CT with N contrast. \na. Sensitivity, 100% \nb. Specificity, 75% \nc. LR+, 4 \nd. LR-, 0 \n3. lntraoral ultrasonography may be used to distinguish \nperitonsillar abscess from cdlulitis and guide needle \naspiration. \na. Sensitivity, 89-95% \nb. Specificity, 79-100% \nTreatment \nA. Drainage, antibiotic therapy, and supportive care are the \nmainstays of therapy. \n1. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that needle \naspiration and incision and drainage are equally effective. \n2. Rates of re-collection and f.tiled resolution in 1-2 days were \ncomparable at 10% for both procedures. \n3. Needle aspiration is generally less invasive, less painful, and \nbetter tolerated. \nB. Antibiotics are recommended in conjunction with drainage to \neffectively treat the abscess and provide coverage for GABHS, \nS aureus, and respiratory anaerobic bacteria. \n1. Drainage and antibiotic therapy resolve peritonsillar abscess \nin > 90% of cases. \n\n528 I CHAPTER 30 \n2. Corticosteroids may reduce pain and reduce length of \nhospitalization by treating edema and inflammation. \nHowever, evidence is inconsistent, and corticosteroids are \nnot routinely recommended. \nC. Many patients can be treated as outpatients. These patients \nshould be: \nI. Observed after drainage to ensure they can tolerate oral \nantibiotics, pain medication, and liquids. \n2. Scheduled to be seen for folloup in 24-36 hours \n3. Advised to return for reevaluation for: \na. D}'lipnea \nb. Worsening throat pain, neck pain, or ttismus \nc. Enlarging mass \nd. Fever \ne. Neck stiffness \nf. Bleeding \nD. Treatment failure should prompt broadening of antibiotics, \nreevaluation with CT to evaluate extent of infection, and \ntonsillectomy. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nThe patlent\"s symptoms of a unilaterally enlarged, medl-\nally displaced tonsil with uvular deviation to contralateral \nside are sufficient to make the diagnosis of perttonsHlar \nabscess. You arrange for ENT evaluation. \nHave you crossed a diagnostic:: threshold \nfor the leading hypotheeie1 Have you ruled \nout ths active alternativee1 Do other tsete \nneed to be dons to exclude the altsmatlve \ndlagnoHe1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Epiglottitis \nSee discussion of epiglottitis in Chapter 33. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Retropharyngeal \nAbscess \nSee discussion of rettopharyngeal abscess in Chapter 33. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Lemierre Syndrome \nTextbook Presentatlon \nLemierre syndrome is a septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jug-\nular vein. Typically, presenting symptoms and signs include high \nfevers, rigors, respiratory distress, and neck or throat pain. Exami-\nnation of the oropharynx may reveal ulceration, pseudomembrane, \nor erythema. Tenderness and swdling may be observed overlying \nthe jugular vein. In some cases, abnormal ph}'liical findings may \nbe absent. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Lemierre syndrome is a rare (3.6 cases/million/year) but \npotentially life-threatening cause of sore throat. \nB. Approximately 81 % of cases are caused by the anaerobic \ngram-negative rod F necrophorum. \nC. Although widespread use of antibiotics in the 1940s led to a \ndramatic decline in its incidence, there recently has been an \nincrease. \nD. F necrophorum is norecognized as an endemic cause of \npharyngitis in adolescents and young adults. The relationship \nbetween F necrophorum pharyngitis and Lemierre syndrome is \nnot well understood. \nE. Symptoms \n1. The most common symptoms ofLemierre syndrome are \nnonspecific (such as sore throat, neck tenderness or swelling \nor both, and fever}. \n2. Some findings seen in Lemierre syndrome that are not \ncommonly seen in pharyngitis are d}'lipnea (23.8%), \npleuritic chest pain (31.1 %), abdominal pain (13.7%), and \ntrismus (9.1%). \nF. Septic emboli can arise from the septic thrombophlebitis. \nPotential complications include: \n1. Lung lesions \nL Septic emboli \nb. Infiltrates \nc. Lung abscess \nd. Pleural effusion \ne. Empyema \n2. Bone and joint \na. Septic arthritis \nb. Osteomyditis \n3. Liver abscess \n4. Central nervous S}'litem complications \nL Brain abscess \nb. Meningitis \nc. Cavernous sinus thrombosis \nG. The symptoms of septic thrombophlebitis and septic emboli \ncan mask the initial oropharyngeal symptoms. \nIn Lemierre syndrome, symptoms of throm-\nbophlebitis and septic emboli can mask the \ninitial oropharyngeal symptoms. The diagnosis \nshould be considered in those patients with \nseptic findings consistent with septic emboli. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. A high clinical suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of \nLemierre syndrome, since the signs and symptoms are often \nnonspecific. \nB. Lemierre syndrome should be considered strongly in \npatients with chills, high fever, and unilateral neck swdling. \nPatients may also have antecedent pharyngitis, septic \npulmonary emboli, and persistent fevers despite antimicrobial \ntherapy. \nC. It may take 5-8 days to isolate F necrophorum. \nD. The following criteria are accepted as strong evidence for the \npresence ofLemierre syndrome: \n1. Anaerobic primary infection of the oropharynx \n2. Subsequent septicemia (with at least 1 positive blood culture) \n3. Metastatic infection of 1 or more distant site \n4. Thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein \nE. CT scan of neck with contrast is the best diagnostic modality. \n\nTreatment \nA. Antibiotics \n1. F necrophorum is usually susceptible to beta-lactamase \nresistant beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, \nmettonidazole, and chloramphenicol. \n2. There is variable response to second- and third-generation \ncephalosporins. \nB. Surgical therapy may be needed for patients with abscesses or \nthose who do not respond to antibiotic therapy. \nC. The role of anticoagulation in treatment ofLernierre syndrome \nis controversial. Due to loincidence of Lemierre syndrome, \nthe risks and benefits of anticoagulation have not been \naddressed in controlled studies. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nCon5ultatlon by ENT led to 5Ucce55ful needle a5plratlon \nwith drainage of 8 mL of purulent material.

He i5 quite alarmed (and embarrassed). \n~ \nWhat is ths difft1N1ntial diagnoeie of traneisnt \n1~1' loH of conecfoueneH1 Howould you frame \nths dlffe1'6ntial1 \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nTransient loss of consciousness may be caused by trauma, intox-\nication, seizures, hypoglycernia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cere-\nbrovascular disease (involving the brainstem), or syncope. Although \nsyncope is often incorrectly assumed to be synonymous with tran-\nsient loss of consciousness, syncope actually refers to that subset of \npatients with transient loss of consciousness due to transimt global \nc~bral hypoperfasion, which in tum is virtually always caused \nby transient profound hypotension. Therefore, the first pivotal \nstep in the evaluation of patimts with transimt loss of consciousness \nis to distinguish syncope from nonsyncopal causes of transient loss of \nconsciousness. Three critical characteristics help distinguish patients \nwith syncope: Syncope is (1) abrupt in onset, (2) briefin duration, \nand (3) recovery is complete and spontaneous (Figure 31-1). The \nexplanation for this is straightforward; because syncope is due to \ntransient global cerebral hypoperfusion, the loss of consciousness is \nabrupt. Furthermore, restoration of blood flomust occur quickly \nor the patient would die rather than present with syncope. There-\nfore, syncope is brief. Finally; when blood flois restored, sponta-\nneous recovery occurs promptly. Patients with other features (eg, a \nprolonged recovery period) should be evaluated for nonsyncopal \ncauses that may masquerade as syncope (eg, seizures, hypoglyce-\nmia). A useful question is to ask the patient what is the next thing \nthe patient remembers after losing consciousness. Any significant \npersistence of confusion beyond a minute or two is critical because \nthis would suggest a nonsyncopal etiology of the transient loss of \nconsciousness (such as a postictal period from a seizure). \nThe second pivotal step in patients with syncope identifies the \nlikely category of their syncope: reflex, orthostatic, or cardiac syncope \n(Figure 31-2). This narrows the differential diagnosis, since each \nof these categories is associated with specific underlying diseases. \nImportantly, this key step also helps identify patients with car-\ndiac syncope who are at a substantially increased risk for sudden \ndeath. Sudden death may occur if the underlying cardiac process \nthat caused the syncope (arrhythmias or obstruction [eg, aortic \nstenosis]) is prolonged rather than brief. \nPatients with syncope should be carefully \nevaluated to determine if they have cardiac \nsyncope and are at increased risk for sudden \ncardiac death. \nThe evaluation of all syncopal patients must include a thor-\nough history, physical exam, and ECG. A detailed history of \nthe event is critical and includes a description of the setting \n(prolonged standing, warm environment), prior volume loss \n(vomiting, diarrhea, melena, rectal bleeding), exactly what the \npatient was doing (exerting themselves), and the position they \nwere in just prior to their syncopal event (standing, sitting, \nsupine). Additionally, patients should be asked about triggers \n(pain, anxiety), prodromal symptoms that proceeded the syn-\ncope (nausea, abdominal pain), associated symptoms (chest \npain, palpitations, shortness of breath), and any signs observed \nTransient loss of consciousness \nYes (all 3) \nSyncope \nDue to global cerebral \nhypoperfuslon \nNo \nNonayncope \nDlfferantlal diagnosis \n1.

The patient's medications should be reviewed and \ntheir past medical history scrutinized to look for any history of \ncardiac disease (including ischemic, valvular, or heart failure \n[HF]). The physical exam should check vital signs and orthos-\ntatic BPs in addition to a thorough cardiac and neurologic exam. \nFinally, an ECG should be obtained in every syncopal patient \nand examined for signs of arrhythmia, conduction disease, ische-\nmia, or structural heart disease. \nPatients with suspected cardiac syncope should be admitted \nfor evaluation (Figure 31-3). Clues that suggest cardiac syncope \ninclude a prior history of cardiac disease; syncope while supine, \nsitting, or during exercise; associated symptoms of chest pain, \npalpitations, or shortness of breath; a family history of sudden \ndeath; or age > 60 years.

Upon viewing the cadaver, he felt queasy and warm. \nHe became diaphoretic and collapsed to the floor. When he \nregained consciousness, he was very embarrassed but not \nconfused. The Instructor told him that he was unconscious \nfor only .a feseconds. \n~ \nAt this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \n1~r what are the active alumatlvee, and le \nthere a must not mlSl!I diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnosis, what teete should be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAli noted previously the flrst step in the evaluation of patients \nwith transient loss of consciousness is to distinguish syncope \nfrom other causes. The abrupt onset, brief duration, and spon-\ntaneous unaided recovery are entirely consistent with syncope \n(Figure 31-1). The next step in the evaluation of such patients is \nto distinguish cardiac syncope from reflex or orthostatic syncope \n(Figure 31-2). The setting (associated with a strong emotional \ntrigger) and associated prodromal symptoms of nausea and \nwarmth are classic for vasovagal syncope, which is clearly the \nleading hypothesis. However, it is critical to also consider car-\ndiac syncope, which is potentially life-threatening and is a must \nnot miss hypothesis. While most causes of cardiac syncope are \nuncommon in young patients, HCM and channelopathies, such \nas the long QT syndrome, can present in children and young \nadults and must be considered. Indeed, patients with the long \nQT syndrome may have life-threatening arrhythmias triggered \nby emotional stress. Finally, orthostatic syncope is an alternative \nhypothesis that must also be considered. Table 31-2 lists the dif-\nferential diagnosis and a careful history, physical exam and revie\nof his ECG are required (Figure 31-2). \n\nMr. M reports no dlarrhea, vomiting, melena or rectal bleed-\ning and he Is not takl~ any medications. He has no known \nhe.art disease and exercises vigorously without symptoms. \nHe reports no .associated chest pain, palpitations, or dys-\npnea. There is no family history of sudden cardiac death. \nOn physic.al exam, his BP .and pulse are norm.al and do not \nchange with standing. Cardiac exam reveals .a regular rate \n.and rhythm without a significant murmur, JVD, 5:3 gallop, \ncrackles or edema. His ECG is normal. \n~ \nle the c::llnlaal Information euffic::lent to make a \n1~r dlagnosle1 If not, what othsr information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Reflex Syncope due to \nVasovagalSyncope \nTextbook Presentation \nVasovagal syncope typically occurs in young patients following a \ntrigger (prolonged standing with or without an emotional stressor) \nand is preceded by prodromal features (warmth, nausea, diaphore-\nsis, sweating, and lightheadedness). \nSYNCOPE I 535 \nTable 31-2.

Reflex syncope refers to a group of related disorders that \ntrigger inappropriate cardiovascular reflexes producing \nhypotension and syncope. \n1. The predominant reflex may be bradycardia (cardioinhibitory \ntype), vasodilatation (vasodepressor type), or both. \n2. This distinction may affect the choice of therapy, \nwith pacemakers a potential option for patients with \nsevere, recurrent symptomatic cardioinhibitory reflex \nsyncope. \n3. Types of reflex syncope include vasovagal (or \nneurocardiogenic syncope), situational syncope, and \ncarotid hypersensitivity. \n4. The triggers vary with the type of reflex syncope: \na. Vasovagal syncope: upright posture with or \nwithout stress \nb. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity: Carotid pressure, \nsee bdo\nc. Situational syncope: associated with defecation, \nmicturition, or prolonged coughing \nB. The remainder of this section focuses on vasovagal syncope. \n1. Most common cause of syncope (20-33% of cases) \n\n536 I CHAPTER 31 \nProlonged standing, \nPain or anxiety \nvenous pooling \nSympathetic surge \nDecreased venous \nVigorous cardiac \nreturn \ncontraction \nBradycardia \nMarkedly reduced \nend-systolic volume \nVagal reflex \nHypotension and \nsyncope \nVasodilation \nFigure 31-4. Pathophysiology of vasovagal syncope \n2. The pathophysiology is illustrated in Figure 31-4 and \nincludes: \na. Prolonged standing causes venous pooling, decreasing \nvenous return thereby decreasing left ventricular (LV) \npreload (which may be accentuated by dehydration). \nb. Superimposed anxiety, pain, or fear triggers a \nsympathetic surge, which augments ventricular \ncontraction. \nc. Vigorous contraction coupled with decreased LY \npreload results in a markedly loend-systolic volume, \nwhich triggers intracardiac mechanoreceptors. \nd. The mechanoreceptors trigger the vagal reflex. \ne. The vagal reflex triggers bradycardia, vasodilatation, \nor both, resulting in hypotension and syncope. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \nI. No single finding is very sensitive for vasovagal syncope \n(14-60%). \na. Triggers include prolonged standing (37%), warm \nenvironment (42%), lack of food (23%), fear (9-21 %), \nand acute pain (14%). \nb. Prodromal symptoms include sweating (32-66%), nausea \n(13-60%), and warmth (6-18%). \nc. Venous pooling after exercise may also trigger vasovagal \nsyncope. However, syncope during exercise suggests \ncardiac syncope. \n2. However, certain findings are fairly specific and increase the \nlikelihood of vasovagal syncope when present. \n~ a. Prolonged standing (LR+, 9.0) \n~ b. Abdominal discomfort prior to syncope (LR+, 8) \n~ c. Occurring during injection/cannulation (LR+, 7) \nd. Dehydration (LR+, 3.7) \ne. Nausea after syncope (LR+, 3.5) \nB. Laboratory and radiologic tests \n1. Patients with a typical history, a normal physical exam \nand ECG, and no red flags (syncope while supine, sitting \nor during exertion, associated chest pain, palpitations or \ndyspnea, age over 60, or prior history of heart disease or \nfamily history of sudden death [see Figure 31-2]) do not \nrequire further testing. \n2. Patients over 40, those with an atypical history (ie, without \na clear precipitant) and those with heart disease or red flags \nrequire additional evaluation including an echocardiogram \nand potentially tilt-table testing and/or an implantable loop \nrecorder (ILR). \n3. T'tlt-table testing in vasovagal syncope \na. The patient is initially supine for 20-45 minutes. \nb. The table is then tilted to 70 degrees and the patient \nkept upright for 30-40 minutes during which time the \npulse and BP are continuously monitored. \nc. lsoproterenol and sublingual nitroglycerin may \nbe given which increase sensitivity but decrease \nspecificity. \nd. Criteria for a positive test include the reproduction \nof the presyncopal or syncopal symptoms with \nhypotension, bradycardia, or both. \ne. Test characteristics are estimates due to the lack of a \ngold standard. However, a recent study utilizing ILRs \nin patients older than 40 years with preswned recurrent \nvasovagal syncope revealed the limited accuracy of \ntilt-table testing. \n(1) No criteria were very sensitive (26-56%). \n(2) Positive tilt-table results are not specific for \n4, ILRs \nvasovagal syncope. \n(a) Tilt-table testing can be positive in patients \nwithout a history of syncope. \n(b) Tilt-table testing can trigger vagal reflexes \nand syncope in patients with syncope due \nto structural heart diseases and arrhythmias, \npotentially leading to a misdiagnosis of \nvasovagal syncope. \n(c) Care must be taken prior to assigning the \ndiagnosis of vasovagal syncope to patients with \npositive tilt-table testing. \nPositive tilt-table tests results are not specific \nfor neurocardiogenic syncope. \nL ILRs are devices implanted into the left pectoral region \nthat can record arrhythmias during syncope for up to \n36 months. \nb.

An approach to reflex syncope is illustrated in Figure 31-S. \nTreatment \nA. Patients should be reassured, instructed to avoid triggers, and \nlie down if they notice the premonitory signs of an impending \nfaint. \nB. Reduction in BP lowering medications (and alcohol} can \nmarkedly reduce the incidence of syncope in patients with \nrecurrent vasodepressor vasovagal syncope (NNT 3). \nC.

Pacemakers are useful for select patients with severe recurrent \ndocumented cardioinhibitory reflex syncope (pauses > 3 s with \nsymptoms or asymptomatic and > 6 s or AV block) refractory \nto other treatments (NNT 3). \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. M's well-defined precipitant for vasovagal syncope and typical \npremonitory symptoms combined with the absence of red flags for \nserious cardiac syncope (such as HF, ischemic heart disease, advanced \nage, abnormal physical exam, or ECG) makes neurocardiogenic \nsyncope the most likely diagnosis. His normal ECG rules out the \nlong QT syndrome. He has no history of dehydration and no ortho-\nstatic changes on physical exam, effectively ruling out orthostatic \nhypotension. You still wonder if you need to consider HCM. \nHave you c:rosHd a diagnostic thresholc:i for \nthe leadfng hypothHfs, neuroc:ardlogenlc:: \neyncopef Have you ruled out the active \naltemativeef Do other teete neea to t1e done \nto mcclude the altematlve dlagnoHe1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Hypertrophic \nCardiomyopathy (HCM) \nTatbook Presentation \nH CM may be asymptomatic and discovered due to a family history \nof sudden cardiac death, during the evaluation of an asymptom-\natic systolic murmur, during preparticipation athletic screening, or \nwhen symptoms occur (syncope, HF, atrial fibrillation, or cardiac \narrest). \nDiseue Highlights \nA. The most common cause of cardiovascular death in young \npeople and among young athletes \nB. A variety of mutations in sarcomere constituents \n(eg, myosin) result in myocyte hypertrophy with disarray, \nincreased cardiac fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. Over \n1400 mutations (usually autosomal dominant) in 11 genes \nhave been reported. \nC. Affects 0.02-0.23% of adults in the general population \nD. The hallmark of the disease is LVH in the absence ofloading \nconditions (hypertension, aortic stenosis, etc.) \n1. LVH may develop in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. \n2. LVH can affect any part of the LY, although often \npreferentially affects the ventricular septum, which can \ncause left ventricular outflotract obstruction (LVOTO). \n\n538 I CHAPTER 31 \n3. LVOTO increases the risk of progression to HF, stroke, and \nsudden cardiac death. The outfloobstruction can be fixed \nor dynamic. \n4. The pathophysiology of obstruction is complex and due \nto (1) septal hypertrophy causing narrowing of the LV \nsubaortic outflotract and (2) the subsequent drag pulling \nthe mitral valve leaflets of into contact with the outflo\ntract. The motion of the mitral valve may also cause mitral \nregurgitation. \n5. Chamber size affects the severity of obstruction. A smaller \nchamber size (ie, from hypovolemia} brings the anterior \nleaflet of mitral valve closer to the hypertrophied septum \nand increases obstruction. This occurs when preload \ndecreases (such as with standing), when afterload decreases \nor when contractility increases. \nE. Most patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. \nF. Complications include HF, angina, mitral regurgitation, atrial \nfibrillation, suoke, syncope, and sudden cardiac death. \n1. HF \na. Typically due to diastolic dysfunction, but systolic \ndysfunction may develop \nb. More common in patients with LVOTO \nc. Develops due to a combination of outfloobstruction \nand diastolic dysfunction \nd. Dyspnea on exertion is the most common symptom. \ne. Aggravated by concomitant mitral regurgitation when \npresent \n2. Angina \na. May be typical or atypical in quality \nb. Develops in 25-30% of patients \nc. May occur secondary to one or more of the following: \n(1) Ischemia without CAD from mismatched supply \nanddemand \n(2) CAD \n(3) LVOTO \n3. Syncope \na. Develops in 15-25% of patients with HCM \nb. May be due to ventricular arrhythmias, outflotract \nobstruction and, rarely, conduction blocks \nc. Unexplained syncope in HCM is a risk factor for \nsudden cardiac death. \n4. Sudden cardiac death is the most dreaded complication. \na. Often occurs in previously asymptomatic patients \nb. Usually secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias \n(which may be triggered by myocardial fibrosis and \ndisarray, outflotract obstruction, or ischemia). \nOccasionally due to asystole, heart block, pulseless \nelectrical activity or thromboembolism. \nc. Annual risk among all patients with HCM: 1-2% \nd. Major risk factors include the following: \n(1) Prior events \n(a) Prior cardiac arrest \n(b) Spontaneous sustained VT \n(2) High-risk clinical factors \n(a) Family history of sudden cardiac death in fust-\ndegree relative younger than 40 years (with or \nwithout HCM) or in first-degree relative of any \nage in whom diagnosis ofHCM was established \n(b) Unexplained syncope (particularly if repetitive, \nexercise-induced, or occurs in children) \n(c) Massive LVH (<!: 30 mm) \n(3) Other risk factors \n(a) Abnormal BP response to exercise (drop \n> 20 mm Hg) in patients 40 years or younger \n(b) Nonsustained VT on ambulatory cardiac \n(Holter) monitoring <!: 3 beats at <!: 120 bpm \n(c) Young age \n(d) LVOTO \n(c) Increased left atrial size \n(f) Late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI \n(4) Electrophysiologic studies (EPS) are not \nrecommended for routine risk stratification. \n5. Atrial fibrillation \na. Develops in 20% of patients with HCM \nb. Left atrial enlargement may develop secondary to \ndecreased LV compliance or mitral regurgitation \nand creates a substrate for the development of atrial \nfibrillation. \nc. Atrial fibrillation decreases LV filling and worsens the \noutflotract obstruction. \nd. Atrial fibrillation markedly increases the risk of \nthromboembolism (OR 17.7 compared with patients in \nsinus rhythm). \n6. Stroke is usually secondary to concomitant atrial fibrillation \nand subsequent embolization. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Echocardiogram is a typical diagnostic test of choice. \n1. Criteria for HCM include LV wall thickening(~ 15 mm) \nin the absence of other conditions known to cause LVH \n(ie, hypertension or aortic stenosis}. \n2. LVH can occur in any part of the LV and in an array of \ndistributions but is often asymmetric in distribution. \n3. The classic pattern that has specific consequences is marked \nby septal hypertrophy. \nB. Cardiac MRI and transesophageal echocardiography can be \nused when transthoracic echocardiography is suboptimal. Late \nenhancement with gadolinium identifies myocardial fibrosis \nand is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac \ndeath. \nC. Physical exam \n1. Patients with HCM may have (1) a normal physical exam \nor (2) the systolic murmur caused by LVOID, a harsh \nsystolic murmur at the apex and lower left sternal border \nand/or (3) the murmur of mitral regurgitation due to \nsystolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leading to poor \nvalve coaptation and mitral regurgitation \n2. The classic HCM murmur is caused by LVOTO and \naccentuated by maneuvers that decrease chamber size \n(causing increased obstruction). \n~ \na. The murmur increases as a patient goes from a squatting \nto a standing position (sensitivity, 95%; specificity, \n84%; LR+, 5.9; LR-, 0.06). \n~ \nb. Passive leg elevation decreases the murmur (sensitivity, \n85%; specificity, 91 %; LR+, 9.4; LR-, 0.16). \nD. ECG findings \n1. ECG abnormalities may p~cede echocardiographic \nabnormalities and become more frequent with age. \n\n2. Abnormalities include repolarization changes (ST-segment \ndevation, depression or T wave inversions) and voltage \ncriteria for LVH. Other findings may include prominent \nQ waves, ldi: atrial enlargement, and ldi: axis deviation. \n3. Abnormal in 86-90% of affected patients with \nechocardiographic LVH and 46% of affected patients \n(gene positive) without LVH. \n4. Voltage criteria for LVH are present in 65% of patients \nwith echocardiographic LVH and 32% of gene-positive \npatients without echocardiographic LVH. \nE. DNA analysis \n1. DNA analysis can identify mutant genes but remains \nimprecise. \n2. Less than 50% of affected patients have an identifiable \nmutation and many mutations are of uncertain \nsignificance. \n3. Testing rdatives of patients with HCM can be useful, \nespecially when probands have a known pathogenic \nmutation. Testing can both identify affected rdatives before \nthe development ofLVH and can also rule out the disease. \nF. Distinguishing HCM from athlete's heart \n1. Highly trained athletes occasionally have significant LVH \n(13-15 mm), which can suggest HCM. A variety of features \ncan be useful to make the distinction in such patients. \n2. Features that suggest HCM include \na. A smaller LY end-diastolic volume< 55 mm \n(100% sensitive, 100% specific) \nb. T wave inversions (52% sensitive, 93% specific; \nLR+, 7.4; LR-, 0.52) \nc. A f.unily history ofHCM \nd. Late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI \nTreatment \nA. Evaluation \n1. Initial and annual laboratory tests should include a \n12-lead ECG, transthoracic echocardiography, 48-hour \nambulatory cardiac (Holter) monitor and continuous \nloop event monitor (for patients with palpitations or light \nheadedness), and a symptom limited stress test (to assess \nBP response to exercise and evaluate ischemia). \n2. Cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement should \nbe considered to further ddineate anatomy. \n3. LVOTO should be evaluated. \na. LVOTO contributes to the risk of sudden death and is \nconsidered significant if> 50 mm Hg. \nb. Since LVOTO is dynamic, a variety of measures \nare used, including standing echocardiography (to \ndecrease preload and increase obstruction) and exercise \ntransthoracic echocardiography in symptomatic patients \nif resting dynamic outfloobstruction is < 50 mm Hg. \nB. Therapy \n1. Asymptomatic patients \na. Patients should avoid dehydration and strenuous \nexertion. Low-intensity aerobic exercise is reasonable. \nb. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are \nunproven in asymptomatic HCM with or without \nobstruction. \nc. Vasodilators and high-dose diuretics should be avoided \nin patients with HCM and obstruction. \nSYNCOPE I 539 \ncl. Septal reduction should not be performed in \nasymptomatic patients. \n2. Symptomatic patients \na. LVOTO \n(1) Beta-blockers decrease contractility and sloheart \nrate, augmenting diastolic filling and thereby \ndecreasing dynamic outfloobstruction. Also \nrecommended in patients with dyspnea or angina \n(2) Disopyramide can be used if beta-blockers are \nineffective. \n(3) Veraparnil or diltiazem \n(a) Can be used if beta-blockers are ineffective or \nnot tolerated \n(b) Verapamil should not be used concurrently with \nbeta-blockers due to a high frequency of heart \nblock and HF \n(c) Other contraindications include advanced HF, \nhigh gradients, or sinus bradycardia. \n(4) Patients with symptomatic {but not asymptomatic) \nLVOTO with gradients :<!: 50 mm Hg \n(a) Symptoms may include HF despite maximum \nmedical therapy, or recurrent exertional syncope \nduetoLVOTO \n(b) Should be considered for septal ablation to \ndecrease the obstruction \n(c) Options include surgical septal rnyectorny \nor intracoronary alcohol infusion into septal \nperforators, which induces necrosis. \n(5) Patients should avoid dehydration; excess \nalcohol consumption; and a variety of drugs, \nincluding digoxin, positive inotropes, arterial \nand venodilators (including dihydropyridines, \nnitrates, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors \nused for erectile dysfunction [sildenafil, tadalafil, \nand vardenafil]) \nb. Chest pain evaluation \n(1) Patients with HCM have a high frequency \nof nonspecific ECG and nuclear imaging \nabnormalities, limiting the utility of stress testing. \n(2) Coronary angiography is recommended in patients \nwith typical exertional angina, survivors of sudden \ndeath, and patients with sustained VT. \nc. Syncope \n(1) The recommended evaluation for patients with \nHCM and syncope include al2-lead ECG, exercise \nstress echocardiography, and 48-hour ambulatory \ncardiac (Holter) monitoring. \n(2) The risk of sudden cardiac death should be \nevaluated. Those at high risk should receive an \nimplantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Those at \nlorisk could be further evaluated with ILR. \ncl. HF \n(1) With LVOTO (see above) \n(2) HFrEF < 50%: \n(a) Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor \n(or angiotensin receptor blockers) and beta-\nblockers are recommended. \n(b) Low-dose diuretics can be used if dyspnea \npersists despite treatment with beta-blockers \nand ACE inhibitor. Mineralocorticoid receptor \nantagonists should be considered. \n\n540 I CHAPTER 31 \n(3) Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: \n(a) Verapamil or dilti.azem should be considered if \nbeta-blockers are ineffective. \n(b) Low-dose diuretics should be considered if \nsymptoms persist. \ne. Atrial fibrillation: Due to the high risk of \nthromboembolism in patients with HCM and atrial \nfibrillation, anticoagulation is recommended. \nC. Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) \n1. I CDs are the most effective strategy to prevent sudden \ncardiac death in patients with HCM. \n2. Recommended for high-risk HCM patients. \na. ICD therapy is recommended for HCM patients with \na history of a prior cardiac arrest or hemodynamically \nsignificant spontaneous sustained vr. \nb. ICD implantation is reasonable in HCM patients \nat increased risk for sudden cardiac death due to a \nfamily history of sudden cardiac death in first-degtee \nrelative, recent unc:x:plained syncope or massive LVH, \nand select patients with nonsustained vr (~ 120 bpm \n:<!: 3 consecutive beats} or abnormal BP response to \nexercise in the presence of other risk factors. \n3. A calculator has been developed by the European Society of \nCardiology to estimate risk. However, 1 analysis of a large \nnumber of patients, suggested that the calculator was not \nsufficiently sensitive to identify patients at risk for sudden \ncardiac death. The \"high risk\" score was only 20% sensitive \nfor sudden cardiac death, 93% specific, LR+ 2.6, LR- 0.9. \nEven a moderate risk score was insufficiently sensitive \n(41%, LR- 0.8) \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. C is a 65-year-old man with diabetes who comes to \nsee you with a chief complaint of I05ing consciousness. He \nreports that he was sitting at home watching televl5lon \nwhen he suddenly lost consciousness without any warn-\ning. His wife reports that he was unresponsive for approx-\nimately 30 seconds. There was no tonic-clonic activity \nor incontinence, and the patient was not confused after \nregaining consciousness. The patient's wife reports that \nshe took Mr. C's blood glucose when he passed out and that \nthe reading was 120 mg/dL. \n~ At this point, what Is the leading hypothesis, \n~r what are the active altemativee, and ie \nthens a muet not miss diagnosis? Given thle \ndifferential diagnosis, what tests should t7e \nort.leret.:11 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAs illustrated in Figure 31-1, the first step in patients with loss of \nconsciousness is to determine whether this was due to syncope, or \nsome nonsyncopal cause (eg, trauma, intoxication, hypoglycemia, \nor seizure). As discussed previously, 3 questions help make this \n4. Patient selection is complex and recommendations are in \nevolution. Consultation is advised. \nD. Screening \n1. First-degree relatives of affected patients should be referred \nfur genetic counsding to discuss screening for HCM. \n2. In the general population, prepartidpation screening \nwith a history (including family history}, physical exam, \nand ECG of all young competitive athletes has been \ndemonstrated to reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac \ndeath by 79% primarily due to a reduction in deaths \nfromHCM. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nAs noted above, Mr. M's history and physical exam and normal \nECG suggest vasovagal syncope. There is no family history of \nsudden cardiac death, significant murmur, or ECG abnormality to \nsuggest either the long QT syndrome or HCM. There is no history \nof dehydration or offending medications (eg, vasodilators} nor \northostatic changes on exam to suggest orthostatic hypotension. \nTilt-cable testing is not indicated in patients with isolated episodes \nof well-defined vasovagal syncope. \n\nMr. M is reassured, and alt hough embarrassed, he feels \nmuch better. After explaining the pat hophyslology of his \ndisorder, you initiate standard recommendat ions for t he \nprevention of further ep150de5. \npivotal distinction: Was the loss of consciousness abrupt in onset, \nbrief in duration, and was there spontaneous unaided recovery? \nClearly, the story suggests that all 3 were true and he therefore \nsuffered from syncope. (Although hypoglycemia should be con-\nsidered in any patient with treated diabetes, his recovery without \nintervention essentially rules that out, as of course, does the normal \nblood glucose at the time.) The second pivotal step in syncopal \npatients is to determine whether the patient has cardiac, orthos-\ntatic, or reflex syncope. As illustrated in Figure 31-2, this process \nis driven by a search for risk factors and associated symptoms to \ndetermine whether the patient is at risk for cardiac syncope, which \ncould be life-threatening. In particular, patients should be asked \nabout a prior history of heart disease or a family history of sudden \ndeath; syncope occurring during exertion or in the supine or seated \nposition; and any associated chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations. \n\nMr. C denies any histor)' of exertion prior to his I05s of \nconsciousness. He denies any associated chest pain, pal-\npitations, or dyspnea. Past medical histor)' reveals t hat \nMr. C ha5 5uffered 2 Ml5. Subsequently. he ha5 dy5pnea \nupon walking more t han 20 yards. His medications Include \natenolol, a5plrln, atorvastatln, Insulin, and llslnoprll. On \nphysical exam, his BP is 128170 mm Hg with a pulse of \n72 bpm, which is regular. There is no signrficant change upon \nstanding. His lung exam Is clear. and cardiac exam reveals \n\nprominent JVD and a loud s, gallop. There is no significant \nmurmur. He has 2+ pretibial edema, and his rectal exam \nreveals guaiac-negative stool. \n~ \nle ths c:linical information euffic:isnt to males a \n1~r dlagnoele1 If not, what other information do \nyou need7 \nMr. C's does not have exertional syncope, chest pain, palpita-\ntions, or dyspnea at the time of syncope. N onctheless, his prior his-\ntory of hean disease substantially increases the likelihood of some \nform of cardiac syncope, which becomes both the leading and must \nnot miss hypothesis. The likelihood of cardiac syncope is increased \neven further because Mr. C's history and exam are not suggestive \nof the other 2 types of syncope: orthostatic or reflex. (Orthostatic \nsyncope is unlikely given his seated position, the absence of any \nhistory of volume loss or bleeding, and more importantly, by the \nlack of postural BP change with standing. Reflex syncope [due to \nneurocardiogenic syncope] is also unlikely given the lack of any \ntrigger, prodrome and because Mr. C.'s syncope occurred while he \nwas sitting.) He should be admitted for evaluation while his his-\ntory, physical exam, and ECG are examined for clues that might \nsuggest the etiology of his probable cardiac syncope (Table 31-1). \nPrior to ranking the differential, it is useful to reviethe syndrome \nof cardiac syncope. \nLeading Hypothesis: Cardiac Syncope \nTenbook Presentation \nCardiac syncope refers to syncope secondary to disorders arising \nwithin the heart. Arrhythmias (either tachyarrhythmias or bradyar-\nrhythmias) are the most common. Less common disorders include \nacute coronary syndromes, obstructive syndromes (aortic stenosis, \nHCM and pulmonary embolism), and rare causes (aortic dissec-\ntion and atrial myxoma). Classically, patients with cardiac syncope \nare elderly patients with known heart disease (ie, HF or CAD) who \nexperience sudden syncope, which may occur without warning. \nPatients may have palpitations. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Cardiac syncope is associated with markedly increased mortality \ncompared with reflex syncope, orthostatic syncope, or syncope \nof unknown cause. \nB. Among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac \ndeath (presumably arrhythmogcnic) accounts for 30% of the \nmortality. \nC. Patients in whom cardiac syncope is suspected should be \nadmitted for evaluation. \nD. Although there are a large number of cardiac dysrhythmias, \nonly a relative feproduce syncope. Most supravcntricular \ntachyarrhythmias will not cause syncope because the AV \nnode limits the ventricular response rate. The most common \narrhythmias associated with syncope include \nI. Tachycardias \na. vr \nb. Supraventricular tachycardias associated with an accessory \npathway (ie, WPW syndrome) or those associated with a \nvery rapid ventricular responses. \n2. Bradycardias \na. Sinus node dysfunction \n(1) Sinus bradycardia (< 35 bpm) \nSYNCOPE I 541 \n(2) Sinus pauses {defined as :> 3 seconds or :> 2 seconds \nwith symptoms) \nb. AV heart block (second- or third-degree) \nc. Atrial fibrillatlon with a sloventricular response \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History \n~ \n1. Certain clinical findings substantially increase the \nlikelihood of cardiac syncope when present, including \na. Preexistent heart disease \nb. An abnormal ECG \nc. Syncope associated with chest pain \ncl. Syncope during exertion (LR+, 6.S-14) \ne. Syncope when supine (LR+, 2.5 -oo) or sitting \n~ \nSyncope during exertion is unusual but \ny \nworrisome and suggests cardiac syncope. \n2. Other symptoms may suggest cardiac syncope but are less \nspecific (palpitations, syncope of sudden onset, dyspnea \nassociated with syncope). \n3. A careful consideration of a patient's associated symptoms, \nphysical exam findings, or ECG abnormalities may suggest \na particular cause of cardiac syncope (see Table 31-1). \n4. Cardiac syncope is unlikely in patients without known or \nsuspected cardiac disease on the basis of the initial history, \nphysical exam, and ECG (LR-, 0.09-0.12). \n5. Table 31-3 summarizes the sensitivity, specificity; and LR \nfor symptoms in predicting cardiac syncope. \nB. ECG \n1. An abnormal ECG increases the OR of cardiac arrhythmias \nin patients without vasovagal syncope (OR, 23.S [Cl, 7 - 87]). \n2. Certain ECG findings in patients with syncope may \nsuggest particular cardiac etiologies {Table 31-1). \na. ECG evidence of prior MI or a long QT interval \nincreases the likelihood ofVf. \nb. ECG findings of significant bradycardia, second- or \nthird-degree AV block increase the likelihood of syncope \ndue to sick sinus syndrome (SSS) or AV block. \nc. Bundle branch block (BBB) on ECG increases the \nlikelihood of both AV block and Vf. \n(1) Mortality in patients with syncope and BBB is 28% \nat 40 months. 32% of the deaths were sudden death. \n(2) The increased mortality is attributed to a combination \nofVf or electromechanical dissociation in patients \nwith underlying heart disease. \nTable 31-3.

Right ventricular suain (S1Q3T3) or right BBB \nsuggests PE. \ne. Ischemic changes suggest Ml. \nf. Ddta wave or short PR interval suggests an accessory \npathway (eg, WPW syndrome). \nC. Clinical decision rules have been devdoped that combine \nclinical risk factors and results from the ECG to predict \ncardiac syncope and mortality. However, clinical judgment \nwas more sensitive at predicting serious 30-day events than \nany of the scoring syiitems (94% vs. \"' 75%). \nD. Other tests \n1. Echocardiograms \na. Useful in patients with suspected aortic stenosis and \nHCM (ie, syiitolic murmur) \nb. Useful in patients with possible cardiac syncope \n(a prior history of cardiac disease; a family history of \nsudden cardiac death; syncope while supine, sitting, or \nwith exertion; associated with chest pain, palpitations, \nor dyspnea; an abnormal cardiac exam; or an abnormal \nECG). Significant abnormalities (ejection fraction \n:s: 40%) found in 27% of such patients and 50% of \nthese patients diagnosed with significant arrhythmias. \nc. Not useful in patients with unexplained syncope \nwithout either a cardiac history or an abnormal ECG. \nd. Table 31-1 summarizes echocardiographic clues in \npatients with syncope. \n2. B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin \na. Neither has demonstrated sufficient accuracy for the \ndiagnosis of cardiac syncope \nb. The 2017 ACC/ AHA/HRS Syncope Guideline only \nrecommended their use if MI or HF is suspected \n3. Exercise testing \na. Particularly useful in patients with exertional syncope, \nchest pain, or ischemic ECG changes \nb. Should be performed with extreme caution \nc. May be useful in patients with dyspnea on exertion \n4. Cardiac monitoring: \na. Diagnostic only if \n(1) Arrhythmia captured anti patient symptomatic \nduring arrhythmia or \n(2) Rhythm normal during symptoms (excludes an \narrhythmia) \n(3) The European Society of Cardiology Guidelines \nalso considers certain significant arrhythmias to \nbe diagnostic even if asymptomatic including \nMobitz II second- or third-degree AV block, \nrapid supraventricular tachycardia > 160 bmp for \n> 32 beats, VT or asystolic pauses ~ 3 sec (except \nyoung trained persons or during sleep or rate-\ncontrolled atrial fibrillation). \nb. A variety of devices can monitor the patient's rhythm \nand transmit the recordings automatically or when \ntriggered. \nc. Devices vary in their duration of monitoring (days fur \nambulatory cardiac [Holter] monitoring to weeks fur \nevent recorders to years for ILRs). \nd. ILRs have been used successfully in some patients \nwith recurrent unexplained syncope. Devices can \nstay in place up to 2-3 years. The yield in such \npatients is often higher (55%) than with external \nmonitors (19%). Importantly, 19% of such \npatients had severe symptomatic bradyarrhythmias \n(usually asystole). Another 11 % of patients had \nno arrhythmia during syncope, ruling out an \narrhythmogenic cause. \nc. Device sdection depends on the frequency of symptoms \n(longer duration important for patients with infrequent \nsymptoms) and the ability of patients to trigger \nthe device \nS. EPS require a right heart catheterization. During EPS, \nstimuli are ddivered in order to elicit tachyarrhythmias \nand detect accessory pathways. Bradyarrhythmias may be \nimplied when patients have prolonged. conduction times \nor when the sinus node responses to rapid pacing are \nabnormal. \na. Sensitivity is 90% for VT. \nb. Sensitivity for bradyarrhythmias is lo(33%). \nc. Overall diagnostic yield of EPS 50% in patients with \nheart disease and 10% in patients without heart disease, \nand 22% in patients with an abnormal ECG vs. 3.7% \nin patients with a normal ECG. \nd. Indications for EPS in patients with unexplained \nsyncope include \n(1) Prior MI \n(2) Structural heart disease \n(3) Impaired LV function \n(4) Bifascicular block \n(S) Monitoring suggests sinus node dysfunction or \nAV block \nc. EPS unnecessary for patients with a class I indication \nfor an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ejection \nfraction :S 35%) \nf. The European Society of Cardiology concluded EPS \nwas not useful in patients with unexplained syncope \nwho did not have structural heart disease, an abnormal \nECG, or palpitations. \ng. Risk of EPS include cardiac perforation, Ml, AV \nfistulae, deep venous thrombosis, and PE. \nE. Table 31-1 summarizes the clues on history, physical exam, \nECG, and echocardiogram that suggest various causes of \ncardiac syncope. \n\nIn review, Mr. C is a 65-year-olt:I man with a history of CAD. \n2 Mis, and recent syncope while sitting. \n~ \nle the cliniGal information sufficient to make a \n1~1' diagnoeief If not, what other information do \nyou nsed1 \n\nReviewing Table 31-1, suggests that Mr. C's past history of CAD \nincreases his risk for cardiac syncope due to AV block or VT, both \nof which are must not miss hypotheses. Furthermore, his history of \ndyspnea on minimal exertion, JVD, and S3 gallop all suggest HF. \nHFrEF also markedly increases the likelihood ofVf, making this \nthe leading hypothesis. Additionally, given Mr. C's past medical \nhistory of CAD, an acute coronary syndrome, must also be consid-\nered (although an uncommon cause of syncope). Finally, another \n\"must not miss\" cause of cardiac syncope is PE. Table 31-4 lists the \ndifferential diagnosis. \n\nThe ECG shows Q waves In leads V1 -V4 and II, Ill, and aVF \nconsistent with prior anterior and inferior Ml. These were \npresent on his prior ECG 6 months previously. The PR inter-\nval is normal. There Is no evidence of sinus bradycardla, sin us \npause, or AV block.

The absence ofBBB or AV block on the current ECG \ndecreases the likelihood of AV block but does not exclude it, since \nAV block can be intermittent. His echocardiogram confirms \nHFrEF, which increases his risk for VT. \nRevised Leading Hypothesis: VT \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients with VT may be asymptomatic or have symptoms that \nrange from palpitations to light-headedness, near syncope, syncope, \nor sudden cardiac death. \nVT occurs most commonly in patients with \nhean disease and should be seriously consid-\nered in patients with syncope and a history of \npreexisting CAD, HF, or other heart disease. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Etiology and associations \n1. Ischemic heart disease \na. Associated with CAD in 80% of cases \nb. May be secondary to acute ischemia/MI or prior scar \nc. VT and ventricular fibrillation complicates 10% of \nSTEMis (ST-segment devated MI) \n2. HF \n3. Other heart diseases: HCM, valvular heart disease, \ninfiltrative disorders \n4, Miscellaneous causes \na. Electrolyte disorders {hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia) \nb. Hypoxia \nc. Drugs, particularly those that prolong the QT \ninterval (eg, antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, tricyclic \nantidepressants, macrolides, some fluoroquinolones, \nand many others) \n5. Congenital disorders \na. Congenital heart disease \n(1) Long QT syndrome \n(a) The ECG of affected families demonstrates long \nrefractory periods (long QT intervals defined \nas a QTc of> 450 ms in males and 460 ms in \nfemales) \n(b) Affected patienrs are at increased risk for sudden \ncardiac death from a form of VT called torsades \nde pointes. \n(c) Arrhytlunias may be precipitated by emotional \nstress, exercise, loud abrupt noises, or during \nsleep. \n(d) Several symptoms typically associated with \nvasovagal syncope are also common in the long \nQT syndrome: triggered by emotional stress, \npain, or noise (70%); sweating (67%); nausea \n(29%); situational (associated with micturitlon, \ndefecation, or coughing) (17%); abdominal \ndiscomfort {16%). \nLong QT syndrome may mimic vasovagal \nsyncope. Even patients with symptoms typical \nof vasovagal syncope should have an ECG \nperformed and QTc measured. \n\n544 I CHAPTER 31 \n(e) Associated with 1:ongenital neural deafness \n(2) Bruga.da syndrome \nB. Prognosis \n(a) Caused by a mutation in the sodium channel \ngene. Affected patients are predisposed to \npolymorphic vr and sudden death. \n(b) Suggestive baseline ECG abnormalities include \na right BBB pattern with ST elevation in the \nright pre1:ordial leads. \n1. vr is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. \n2. Predictors of mortality in patients with Vf include prior \n1:ardiac arrest, LY dY5fun1:tion, post-Ml, or inducible Vf \nonEPS. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA.

Sustained VT is defined as VT lasting > 30 seconds. \nB. EPS can be performed in patients with risk factors for \nVT (eg, ischemic heart disease, HF, HCM), but without \ndocumented VT. \n1. The ability to provoke sustained monomorphic VT is \ndiagnostic. \n2. This is particularly useful in patients in whom VT is \nsuspected but do not already have an indication for \nan ICD. \nTreatment \nA. Patients with ongoing VT \n1. Unstable patients (with hypotension, angina, HF, or \naltered mental status) should be managed according to \nACLS guidelines. \n2. The evaluation should include \na. Obtain baseline ECG (if patient sufficiently stable) \nb. Measure troponin level to look for evidence of ischemia. \nc. Check. electrolytes (especially potassium, magnesium) \nand Sa02 \nd. Reviemedications to search for drugs associated with \nQT prolongation. \ne. Measure drug levels as appropriate (eg, digoxin) \nB. Follow-up evaluation is directed at evaluating the etiologies of \nVT and risk for sudden death. \n1. Stress testing (and coronary angiography in selected \npatients) can help uncover underlying ischemia \nprecipitating VT and is recommended for patients with \nexercise-induced syncope or chest pain or an intermediate \nor greater probability of CAD. \n2. An echocardiogram should be obtained to evaluate LY \nfunction and rule out valvular heart disease and HF. \n3. EPS are recommended for selected patients. \nC. Prevention of recurrent VT and sudden cardiac death \n1. Treat underlying conditions \na. Treat ischemic heart disease (including revascularization \nif necessary) \nb. Treat HF (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] \ninhibitors, beta-blockade, and spironolactone have all \nbeen shown to decrease mortality). \nc. Optimize electrolytes, including magnesium. \n2. Specific therapy for the treatment and prevention ofVT \nincludes antiarrhythmic drugs (especially beta-blockers \nand possibly amiodarone), catheter ablation, ICDs, and \ncombinations of the above. \na. ICDs are implanted devices that monitor the cardiac \nrhythm and automatically detect and cardiovert patients \nin VT. \nb. ICDs are used in selected patients at high risk for \nsudden death, including select patients with HFrEF, \nsurvivors of sudden death, patients with sustained VT \nand patients in whom syncope was believed to have \nbeen caused by VT. \nc. Appropriate use criteria for ICDs have been published \nby the ACCF/AHA. \nSYNCOPE I 545 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome & \nSyncope \nAcute coronary syndrome is an unusual cause of syncope and is \ncovered extensively in Chapter 9, Chest Pain. This discussion will \nfocus on patients who experience syncope due to an acute coronary \nsyndrome. Briefly, acute coronary syndromes account for approxi-\nmately 3% of patients presenting to emergency departments with \nsyncope. The mechanism of syncope varies and includes reflex syn-\ncope (particularly in inferior Mis), advanced AV block (particularly \nin anterior Mis) and VT. Symptoms are often atypical in syncopal \npatients with acute MI; chest pain is present in only 17%, dyspnea \nin 30%, and a history of CAD in 54%. Lab abnormalities include \ntroponin elevation on presentation (50%) and ST-segment eleva-\ntion (9%). Nonetheless, a normal ECG (defined as normal sinus \nrhythm without neor indeterminate changes) makes the diagno-\nsis of acute MI unlikely, negative predictive value 99% (sensitivity, \n80%; specificity, 64%; LR+, 2.2; LR-, 0.31). \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr. G's serum troponin levels are repeatedly undetectable \n(thus excluditlfl acute Ml.) The pretest probability of VT is \nveryhfgh. \nYou still wonder if a significant bradyarrhythmia or a PE might be \nresponsible for Mr. C 's syncope. \nHave you c::roesed a diagnostic threshold for \nths leading hypotheeie, ITT Do other tset& \nneed to be done to exclude the altematfve \ndiagnosee1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Bradycardia from 555 \nTextbook Presentation \nThe presentation of SSS depends on the duration and severity of \nthe bradyarrhythmia. When the bradyarrhythmia is severe and \nprolonged, patients may experience sudden syncope. With less \nsevere bradycardia, patienrs may experience weakness, dyspnea \non exertion, HF, angina, transient ischemic attacks, or near syn-\ncope. Since the bradyarrhythmia may be short-lived, patients may \nrecover without intervention. \nDisca5e Highlights \nA. Episodic or persistent failure of sinus node to meet the physio-\nlogical demands of the patient \nB. Often progressive over time \nC. Electrical manifestations include: \n1. Sinus bradycardia < 40 bpm \n2. Sinus pauses > 2 seconds \n3. Sinus arrest (with an escape junctional rhythm) \n4. Sinoatrial exit block. (inability of the sinus impulse to exit \nthe sinus node) \n5. Chronotropic incompetence: In this condition, the sinus \nrate docs not increase appropriately with physical activity, \nleading to rdative bradycardia and symptoms. \n\n546 I CHAPTER 31 \n6. Tachy-brady syndrome: SSS is associated with \nsupraventricular tachyarrhythmias, in 40-60% of patients, \nparticularly atrial fibrillation. Such patients may complain \nof palpitations. The bradycardia often follows termination \nof the tachycardia. Tachy-brady syndrome markedly \nincreases the risk. of death or nonf.ual stroke (2- to 3-fold) \ncompared with SSS alone. \nD. Most common indication for pacemaker placement (accounts \nfor 30-50% of all pacemakers) \nE. Age is the leading risk. factor (RR 1.73 per 5 y). The mean age \nof onset is 68 years. \nF. Usually due to fibrosis and degeneration of sinus node. \nG. Underlying CAD is common and contributes to the patho-\ngenesis of SSS in some patients. \nH. A variety of medications can depress sinus node function and \naggravate SSS, including beta-blockers, verapamil, diltiazem, \ndigoxin, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, cimetidine, clonidine, \nlithium, methyldopa, and other antiarrhythmics. \nI. Less common causes include hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, \namyloidosis, hemochromatosis, pericarditis, Lyme disease, \nChagas disease, and rheumatic fever. \nJ. Concomitant AV conduction disturbances are present in over \n50% of patients with SSS. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Simultaneous symptoms and ECG findings (sinus brady-\ncardia, significant pauses or sinus exit block.) establishes the \ndiagnosis. \nB. Ambulatory cardiac (Holter) monitoring may be used but \nis often nondiagnostic due to the intermittent nature of the \narrhythmia. \nC. External cardiac continuous loop event monitors allofor a \nlonger period of monitoring and correlation with symptoms. \nD. ILRs have also been used to provide even longer periods of \nmonitoring. \nE. EPS: Occasionally used in patients with severe symptoms \nwhen monitoring has fuled to capture patients during \nTable 31-5. Classification of heart block. \nClusification \nAV Conduction \nECG Findings \nFirst-degree \n1 :1 \nPR Interval > 0.2 seconds \nsymptoms (which could confirm or exclude SSS). However, \nsensitivity is imperfect and normal results do not rule out SSS. \nF. Exercise stress testing can be useful to identify ischemia or \nchronotropic incompetence. \nTreatment \nA. Unstable patients: Treat according to ACLS guidelines \nB. In stable patients, discontinue any medications that may \nadversely affect sinus function (see above). (If beta-blockers \nor other drugs cannot be discontinued, patients may require \na pacemaker.) \nC. Indications for pacemaker placement \n1. Documented symptomlltic sinus node dysfunction \n(bradycardia or pauses), including those resulting from \nmedications that cannot be discontinued \n2. Symptomatic chronotropic incompetence (inability to \nobtain an adequate heart rate for exertion) \n3. Pacemakers are reasonabk in patients with unexplained \nsyncope when SSS is suspected but cannot be confirmed. \na. Patients with HR < 40 bpm while awake \nb. EPS reveals evidence of significant sinus node \ndysfunction. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Bradycardia due to \nAV Heart Block \nTextbook Presentation \nDepending on the duration and severity of the heart block., patients \nwith AV block. may be asymptomatic or complain of syncope, near \nsyncope, sudden cardiac death, palpitations, angina, or transient \nischemic attacks. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Secondary to conduction abnormalities in the AV node, \nbundle of His, or bundle branches impairing transmission \nfrom atria to the ventricles. \nB. The dismrbance may be intermittent or permanent. \nC.

In first-degree AV block, aO of the sinus impulses (P waves) \nare conducted but the PR interval is prolonged. \n2. In second-degree block, some of the impulses arc \nconducted. There are 2 subtypes: Mobitz type I and Mobitz \ntype II (Table 31-5). \n3. In third-degree AV block, none of the P waves are \nconducted (Figure 31-8). \n4. In second- or third-degree AV block, the ventricular rate \nslows and may depend on lower intrinsic pacemakers \nresiding within the ventricle. The bradycardia can cause \ndyspnca. angina, hypotcnsion, syncope, or death. \nD. AV nodal disease should also be suspected in patients with \natrial fibrillation who have a sloventricular response and are \nnot taking medications that sloAV conduction (cg, digoxin, \nbeta-blockers, vcrapamil, or diltiazem). \nE.

Unexplained syncope and chronic bifascicular block \n(especially if accompanied by an HV interval ~ 70 ms \non EPS) \nAlternative Diagnosis: PE \nTatbook Presentation \nPE is covered extensively in Chapter 15, Dyspnea. This discussion \nwill focus on patients who experience syncope due to PE. \nThe classic presentation of a patient with PE and syncope is an \nolder patient with risk factors for venous thromboembolic disease \nwith the sudden onset of chest pain, dyspnea, and sudden loss of \nconsciousness. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. PE is a more common cause of syncope than commonly \nappreciated. PE was diagnosed in 17% of patients admitted \nfor their first episode of syncope who did not have an obvious \ncause (eg, dehydration, vasovagal}. \nB. Syncope complicates PE in 9-24% of patients. \nC. Syncope is secondary to massive embolization (involving \n> 50% of the pulmonary vascular bed), critically limiting blood \nreturn to the LY, reducing cardiac output, causing hypoten-\nsion and syncope. \n1~1~111411111 \nFigure 31-8. Third-degree atrioventricular block. \n\n548 I CHAPTER 31 \nEvidena>-Based Diagnosis \nA. Echocardiography reveals RV dysfunction in 88-94% of \npatients with PE and syncope (due to the extent of emboliza-\ntion required for syncope to occur). \nB. Patients with PE and syncope who survive to arrive at the hos-\npital have often stabilized (probably due to clot fragmentation \nand improved LY return), may be hemodynamically stable \nand relativdy asymptomatic. \nC. 25% of patients with PE and syncope had no other symptoms \nor signs suggestive of PE (increasing the likelihood of missed \ndiagnoses). \nPE should be considered in patients with syn-\ncope of unknown origin, even in the absence of \nother clinical symptoms and signs. \nD. Patients with PE and syncope may have typical risk factors, \nassociated symptoms (eg, chest pain or dyspnea) and signs \nsuggesting PE. \nE. Findings suggestive of PE in such patients with syncope include \ntachypnea (LR+, 6.4) and unilateral leg swelling (LR+, 8.9). \nF. Other findings that might suggest PE include \nI. Persistent hypotension \n2. Hypoxia (Pa02 < 60 mm Hg) \n3. ECG findings (S 1 Q3T3 pattern, right axis deviation, or \nright BBB) \n4. Radiographic findings (an unexplained pleural effusion or \ninfiltrate suggestive of pulmonary infarction) \n5. Echocardiographic findings of right atrial or right \nventricular enlargement \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT W \nMrs. S is a 60-year-old woman who arrives at the emer-\ngency department via ambulance after an episode of tran-\nsient loss of consciousness. The patient reports that she \nwas eating dinner. and the next thing she kneshe was In \nthe emergency department. Mr. S reports that he found his \nwife lyi119 on the floor next to the dining room table when \nhe came home. At that time, Mrs. S was conscious but \nlethargic. The food and plate were scattered on the floor. \nThere was no evidence of incontinence. On physical exam, \nher vital signs are normal. HEENT exam reveals a contusion \nover the right eye and bruising along the right half of her \ntongue. Cardiac and pulmonal)' exams are normal. Abdom-\ninal exam is unremarkable. Stool Is gualac negative. Neuro-\nloglc exam Is nonfocal. \n~ \nAt thl5 point, what le the leading hypothesis, \n1~r what are the aGtlve altematlve9, and 19 \nthere a must not ml55 diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential c:liagnoeie, what teete ehoulc:l 17s \norc:lsrec:l1 \nG. D-dimer assays and CT angiogram are the most commonly \nused tests to evaluate patients with possible PE. \nTreatment \nSee Chapter 15. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nAfter 24 hours, Mr. C Is feell119 well. He Is anxious to go \nhome. The telemetry reveals normal sinus rhythm without \nevidence of intermittent AV 171ock or VT. Stress testi119 \nIs performed and shows evidence of prior Ml but no acute \nlschemla. A D-dlmer level Is normal. \nThe sensitivity of tdemetry is inadequate to exclude life-threatening \narrhythmias such as Vf. Furthermore, none of the alternative diag-\nnoses (such as PE, SSS, or AV heart block) are suggested by the \nhistory, physical exams, or laboratory test results. After careful dis-\ncussion with Mr. C, you order an EPS. \n\nThe EPS demonstrates inducible sustained VT, placi119 \nthe patient at high risk for spontaneous lethal ventricu-\nlar arrhythmias. An !CD Is placed. At follow-up 12 months \nlater. Mr. C Is doing well and has no subsequent syncopal \nevents. His ICD has delivered 2 shocks. \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAs noted previously, the first pivotal step in the evaluation of \npatients with transient loss of consciousness is to determine if the \nloss of consciousness was due to syncope or some nonsyncopal \ncause (Figure 31-1). Furthermore, the cardinal features of syncope \narc: an abrupt onset, brief duration, and a spontaneous unaided \nrecovered. The remarkable feature of Mrs. S's history is the pro-\nlonged period of lethargy and confusion that persisted until she: \nreached the emergency department. This is a pivotal due that sug-\ngests a nonsyncopal etiology for her loss of consciousness. Diag-\nnostic considerations include seizure, hypoglycemia, intoxication, \nor another neurologic event (eg, an ischernic event involving the: \nposterior circulation or trauma). The patient's bruised tongue is \na diagnostic fingerprint that markedly increases the likelihood of \na seizure. Hypoglycemia-induced syncope is usually preceded by \neither confusion or sympathetic stimulation producing tremulous-\nness, nervousness, or diaphoresis and occurs almost exclusively in \ndiabetic patients taking insulin, sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinedi-\nones. Table 31-6 lists the: differential diagnosis. \nPatients with syncope should be asked, \"What \nwas the next thing you remember?\" Patients \nwho do not remember the ambulance ride or \nsuffer a period of amnesia following the event \n(> 5 minutes) should be evaluated for seizures. \n\nTable 31-6.

The purpose of this revieis to \nfocus on features that help distinguish seizures from syncope. \nDisease Highlights \nA. 3% of the US population suffers a seizure in their lifetime \nB.

Some commonly used medications that cause \nseizures (albeit rarely) include cyclosporine, fentanyl, \nmeperidine, lidocaine, phenothiazines, quinolones, \ntheophylline, tricyclic antidepressants, and bupropion. \n8. Illicit drugs ie, MOMA (Ecstasy), cocaine \n9. Withdrawal states (ie, alcohol, baclofen, benzodiazepines, \nand opioids) \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. FP: Tongue laceration, head turning, and unusual posturing \nare the most specific clinical features and substantially increase \nthe likelihood of seizure (specificity, 97%, LR+, 12-15) \n(see Table 31-7). \nB. Most patients with generalized seizures have postictal confusion. \nThe absence of a postictal period makes generalized seizures \nunlikely (sensitivity, 94%, LR-, 0.09). \nC. Certain symptoms are unusual in patienrs with seizures and \ntheir presence reduces the likelihood of seizure. \n1. Diaphoresis preceding spell, LR 0.17 \n2. Chest pain preceding spell, LR 0.15 \n3.

Limb jerking due to syncope \nis associated with myoclonic jerks, which should be \ndistinguished from tonic-clonic activity. \na. Myoclonic jerks tend to be arrhythmic and asymmetric, \nwhereas the opposite is true of tonic-clonic activity. \nb. Myoclonic jerks tend to be briefer (average of 6.6 seconds) \nthan tonic-clonic activity seen in seizures (= 1 minute) \nc. Myoclonic jerks n~r precede collapse, whereas tonic-\nclonic activity may precede collapse. \n3. Finally, unlike generalized seizures, which are usually \nassociated with a significant postictal period, convulsive \nsyncope is not associated with a significant postictal period \n(< 1 minute). \n4. Patients who appear to have refractory \"seizure disorders\" \nand nonspecific abnormalities on dectroencephalogram \n(EEG) should undergo a cardiac evaluation to rule out \nconvulsive syncope with myoclonic jerks. \nE. A point score to distinguish seizures from syncope has been \ndeveloped (Table 31-8). Point scores oh 1 suggest seizures \n(sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 94%; LR+, 16; LR-, 0.06). \nF. Evaluation \n1. EEG \na. Indicated in the evaluation of patients with possible \nseizures \nb. Sensitivity is lobetween episodes (35-50%), but \nincreases with sleep deprivation \nc.

ILR have also been used in patients with suspected but \nunproven seizures refractory to medical therapy and \ndocumented arrhythmias in 26%. \n5. Sodium, calcium, glucose, BUN, creatinine, and oxygen \nsaturation should be measured. \n6. Lumbar puncture \na. A lumbar puncture should be considered \nif CNS infection is suspected (ie, patient is \nimmunocompromised or has fever, meningismus, \nheadache, or persistent confusion). \nb. Elevated intracranial pressure should be excluded prior \nto a lumbar puncture (usually with neuroimaging) in \norder to prevent lumbar puncmre-induced herniation. \nc. Platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial \nthromboplastin time should be checked prior to lumbar \npuncture. (Thrombocytopenia and coaguJopathies \nincrease the risk of bleeding at the lumbar puncture site \nand subsequent spinal cord compression secondary to \nhernorrhage.) \n7. Toxicology screen should be ordered if illicit drug use is \nsuspected. \nTreatment \nAnticonvulsant therapy is complex and evolves rapidly {see neu-\nrology texts). \n\nAn EEG Is ordered to evaluate the patient for possll'Jle \nseizures. \nThe patient's bruised tongue and postictal period strongly sug-\ngest seizures despite the lack of a previously known seizure disorder \nor witnesses to the event. You also wonder if an acute stroke is \nlikely and if additional imaging of the extracranial or intracranial \nvessel is warranted. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Cerebrovascular \nDisease &: Syncope \nAlthough physicians commonly consider carotid artery obstruction \nin the differential diagnosis of patients with syncope, syncope requires \ntransient global cerebral hypoperfusion and unilateral obstruction of \nthe carotid will not result in syncope. Therefore, evaluation of the \nanterior circulation is not indicated in the patient with syncope. On \nthe other hand, obstruction of the posterior circulation may cause \ntransient loss of consciousness by causing ischemia in the reticular \nactivating system. This may occur in the subclavian steal syndrome, \nvenebrobasilar insufficiency, and basilar artery occlusion. These \ndisorders are almost invariably associated with neurologic signs or \nsymptoms and should be considered whenever patients have syncope \nand other symptoms referable to the brainstem (ie, diplopia, vertigo, \nataxia, and weaknes.s) {see Chapter 14, Dizziness). Finally, patients \nin whom subarachnoid hemorrhage develops can present with syn-\ncope. Such patients inevitably also complain of severe headache or \nconfusion. Evaluation includes emergent noncontrast head CT scan. \n\nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nThe patient's EEG revealed intermittent right temporal \nspike and wave pattern. \nThe EEG confirms new-onset seizlll'Cs. Since structural lesions \nare common in adults with new-onset seizures, neuroimaging is \nrequired. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMrs. P ls a 42-year-old woman who arrives at the emer-\ngency department via ambulance with abdominal pain and \nsyncope. She was in her usual state of health until the \nmorning of admission when increasing left lower quadrant \nabdominal pain developed. The pain Increased In Intensity \nand became quite severe. Upon standing, she lost con-\nsciousness and collapsed to the floor. She recovered qu lckly \nand was helped to a chair by her husband. When she stood \nseveral minutes later, she briefly lost consciousness again. \nThe patient reports that her abdominal pain is much bet-\nter. She has no chest pain or dyspnea. Her vita[ signs are \nBP, 105/60 mm Hg; pulse, 85 bpm; temperature, 37.0\"C; \nand RR. 18 breaths per minute. Her cardiac and pulmonary \nexams are normal, and abdominal exam reveals mild left \nlower quadrant tenderness. Her ECG Is norma 1 and her HGT \nis normal at 36.0%. \nAt thie point, what ie ths lading hypothtJeie, \nwhat are ths active altemativee, and le \nthsrs a must not ml55 dlaenosls1 Givsn this \ndifferential dlagnoele, what teete should be \norc.leret.11 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAs noted in Figure 31-1 the first step ascertains whether Mrs. P \nsuffered &om syncope or some other transient loss of conscious-\nness. The history of abrupt onset and rapid recovery without \nintervention strongly suggests syncope. The next step considers \nwhether this is likely due to reflex syncope, orthostatic syncope, \nor cardiac syncope (Figure 31-2). Several features of Mrs. P's syn-\ncope are noreworthy. First, her syncope occurred in association \nwith abdominal pain raising the possibility of vasovagal syncope. \nSecond, she had 2 episodes of syncope upon standing. This piv-\notal clue raises the possibility of orthostatic syncope &om either \ndehydration, hemorrhage, medications, or autonomic d}'5function. \nFinally, cardiac syncope should be considered in all patients with \nsyncope. Fortunately, Mrs. P has no prior history of heart disease \nthat would increase the likelihood of cardiac syncope. Additionally, \nshe has no suggestive symptoms (syncope with chest pain, syncope \nwith exertion, syncope while sitting or supine, palpitations, or \nd}'5pnea), or signs (significant murmur, gallop, or JVD) to suggest \ncardiac syncope. Her ECG is also normal. The combination of the \nSYNCOPE I 551 \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nAn MRI scan revealed a solitary right temporal Jobe mass. \nSubsequent biopsy demonstrated a glioblastoma multi-\nforme. The patient underwent surgical resection and was \ntreated with antlconvulsant t herapy. She died approxi-\nmately 6 months later. \nlack of underlying heart disease or suggestive symptoms of cardiac \nsyncope, coupled with recurrent syncope immediately after stand-\ning makes orthostatic syncope likely and cardiac syncope unlikely. \nTable 31-9 lists the differential diagnosis. \nTable 31-9.

Your Initial assessment is a neurocardiogenic \nsyncope secondary to transient abdominal pain. \nAs discussed in the first case presentation, vasovagal syncope is \noften precipitated by pain, is brief, and is followed by a rapid res--\ntoration of consciousness. Many of Mrs. P's features arc consistent \nwith this diagnosis. However, both episodes of syncope occurred \nimmediately after standing providing a clue that her syncope was \nin fact orthostatic. In addition, although her abdominal pain is \nimproved, it is still unexplained. You elect to check her orthos-\ntatic BP and pulse, which is a key component of the evaluation of \npatients with syncope {Figure 31-2). \n\nMrs. P's BP while supine was 105/60 mm Hg with a \npulse of 85 bpm. which changed when sitting to BP of \n95/50 mm Hg with a pulse of 90 bpm. Upon standing her \nBP fell to 60/0, her pule;e was 140 bpm. and she lost con-\nsciousness. She was quickly laid down and again rapidly \nregained consclouemess. \nOrthostatic measurement of BP and pulse are \ncritical. Life-threatening hypovolemia may be \noverlooked if the BP and pulse are not mea-\nsured while the patient is standing. \nMrs. P's profound drop in BP upon standing and recurrent syn-\ncope is a key pivotal clue and clearly indicate that her syncope is \ndue to orthostatic hypotension. This is not consistent with reflex \nsyncope. You revise the leading hypothesis to syncope due to \northostatic hypotension. \nIs the cllnfcal Information sufficient to make a \ndiagnoeie1 If not, what othsr information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Orthostatic Hypotension \nTextbook Presentation \nOrthostatic hypotension usually becomes symptomatic when \npatients stand. Patients typically note that they passed out almost \nimmediately after standing from a chair or arising from bed. Other \nsymptoms include near syncope, weakness, visual blurring, weak-\nness, or leg buckling. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Orthostatic hypotension occurs in 20% of patients over age \n75 and accounts for 12-30% of patients with syncope. \nB. Classic orthostatic hypotension occurs within 3 minutes of \nstanding. Orthostatic hypotension may also be delayed for \n> 3-10 minutes or develop rapidly, be transient, and difficult \nto detect with standard sphygmomanometry. \nI. Transient orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in \nsystolic BP > 40 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 20 mm Hg \nwithin 15 seconds of standing. \n2. Due to its rapid improvement, this cannot be detected \nwithout beat-to-beat BP measurements, but patients may \nbe symptomatic nonetheless. \n3. One study documented that 27% of patients with \northostatic dizziness but without demonstrable orthostatic \nhypotension had a history of syncope, suggesting that \nmany of these patients had transient or intermittent \northostatic hypotension that was undetected. Another \nstudy documented that this accounted for 8% of syncope \ncases among young adults. \nC. Etiology \n1. Hypovolemia \na. Dehydration \n(1) Decreased oral intake \n(2) GI losses (vomiting, diarrhea) \n(3) Urinary losses \n(a) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus \n{b) Salt-losing nephropathy \n(c) Adrenal insufficiency \nb. Hemorrhage \n(1) GI \n(2) Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm \n(3) Ruptured spleen \n(4) Ruptured ectopic pregnancy \nIntra-abdominal and retroperitoneal bleeding \nare uncommon causes of orthostatic syncope \nbut can be life-threatening and occult! They \nshould be considered in patients with marked \northostatic hypotension of unclear cause partic-\nularly if there is abdominal or back pain. \nc. Overdialysis \nd. Postprandial hypotension, particularly common in the \ndderly and worse with large carbohydrate meals or \nalcohol ingestion. Splanchnic pooling decreases venous \nreturn. \nc. Hot environments {hot tubs, baths, saunas) \n2. Medications \na. Alpha- and beta-blockers \nb. Diuretics \nc. Vasodilators {ie, nitrates, calcium channd blockers, \nhydralazine) \nd. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers \nc. Tricyclic antidepressants \nf. Antipsychotic and anti-parkinsonism drugs \ng. Sildenafil and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors \nparticularly when combined with nitrates \nh. Alcohol, sedative hypnotics, and opioids \n3. Autonomic insufficiency: Many {but not all) such \npatients demonstrate a fall in BP upon standing without a \nconcomitant increase in pulse. \na. Central neurologic disorders {eg, Parkinson disease, \nmultisystem atrophy, pure autonomic failure, multiple \nsclerosis, and numerous others) \nb. Peripheral neurologic disorders: Diabetes mellirus, \nvitamin B12 deficiency, uremia, Lyme disease, syphilis, \nHN and other causes of autonomic neuropathies \nc. Prolonged bed rest \n\nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Definition of orthostatic hypotension \n1. <!: 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic BP within 3 minutes of \nstanding; a decrease in systolic BP of<!: 30 mm Hg may be \na more appropriate criterion in patients with hypertension \n2. <!: 10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic BP within 3 minutes of \nstanding \n3. Or > 30 bpm increase in pulse within 3 minutes of \nstanding \n4. The European Society of Cardiology also includes a fall in \nsystolic BP to < 90 mm Hg. \nB. 20% of the elderly have postural hypotension. Therefore, the \npresence of orthostatic hypotension alone does not confirm \nthat syncope was secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Syn-\ncope from orthostatic hypotension is confirmed in patients \nwith both orthostatic hypotension ana syncope or presyncope \non standing. \nC. Orthostatic measurements are far more sensitive than isolated \nseated or supine BP measurements, which can miss profound \northostatic hypotension even in patients with syncope due to \nlife-threatening hemorrhage or marked dehydration. Studies \non the impact of moderate volume phlebotomy (450-630 mL) \nor large volume phlebotomy (630-1150 mL) reveal the \nfollowing: \n1. Simple supine measurements of BP and pulse were not \nsensitive to even large blood loss (sensitivity, 12-33%) \n. 2. An increase in pulse of> 30 bpm with standing is both \nhighly sensitive for large volume (1-2 units) blood loss \n(97%) and highly specific (98%, LR+, 48) (Table 31-10). \nThe sensitivity falls dramatically if the patient sits instead \nof stands (39-78%). \n3. The sensitivity of orthostatic measurements is greatest if the \nsupine and standing BPs are compared. If the supine BP \nis not measured, 67% of orthostatic patients may not be \nidentified. \n., 4. Any abnormal finding on orthostatic maneuvers strongly \nsuggested volume loss (specificity, 94-98%; LR+, 3.0-48). \n5. Patients should stand for 1 minute before the measurement \nof the upright BP. \n6. No measure was very sensitive for moderate blood loss \n(0-27%). \nOrthostatic vital signs are a key component of \nthe physical exam in patients with syncope or \nnear syncope \nTable 31-1 O.

Profound blood loss may occasionally paradoxically \nproduce bradycardia. {The reduction in end-systolic \nvolume may trigger the neurally mediated reflex.) \n8. A CBC may be useful but it is critical to appreciate that the \ninitial HCT may not accurately reflect the severity of acute \nhemorrhage. The HCT may be normal prior to rehydration \nand the fall in HCT may take 24-72 hours. \nD. Tilt-table testing can be useful to diagnose delayed orthostatic \nhypotension. \nE. A history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or inadequate intake \ncan suggest volume depletion that is supported by elevations \nin BUN, creatinine and/or lourinary Na+, FSi,.. or FEwu. \nTreatment \nA. Acute blood loss: Blood transfusion is appropriate in the \northostatic patient with acute blood loss as well as identifica-\ntion and treatment of the underlying disorder. \nB. Dehydration (diarrhea, vomiting, or decreased oral intake) \n1. Patients able to tolerate oral intake: oral rehydration \npreferably with sodium-rich beverages \n2. Patients unable to tolerate oral intake: N hydration \na. Normal saline is preferred. \nb. Usually 500 mL to 1 L boluses are given over 1 hour. \nc. Smaller boluses may be given to fragile patients {ie, \nsmall elderly women or those with a history of kidney \ndisease or HF). \nd. Repeat orthostatic BP measurements are made following \neach bolus as well as a lung and cardiac exam to ensure \nthe patient has not received excessive fluid. \ne. Bolus therapy should be continued until orthostatic \nhypotension resolves. \nC. Chronic orthostatic hypotension \n1. Hydration (water, soup, or sports drinks) \n2. Discontinue or decrease offending medications \n(antihypenensives, especially beta-blockers, thiazides, \nand alpha-blockers; nitrates; tricydic antidepressants; \nphenothiazines). \n3. Counterpressure maneuvers can be tried. (See vasovagal \nsyncope above.) \n4. Patients are advised to arise slowly (sitting on the side of \nthe bed prior to standing), avoid large meals and excessive \nheat, and use waist high support hose. \n5. Alpha-agonists (ie, midodrine) have also been used \nsuccessfully. Side effects include urinary retention, \nhypertension, and worsening HF. \n6. Fludroconisone has also been used successfully. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMrs. P reports that she has not suffered from any dlarrhea \nor vom~lng and has Ingested normal amounts of fluid. She \ndenies any hematemesis, melena. or bright red blood per \nrectum. \nIt is important to remember that Mrs. P presented with syncope \nana abdominal pain. Although the pain has improved, it has not \n\n554 I CHAPTER 31 \nresolved; it may provide an important clue to the underlying eti-\nology. Given the profound orthostatic hypotension and the lack \nof external blood or volume loss, or incriminating medication, \ninternal bleeding muse be considered as a source of her abdominal \npain and syncope. In the differential diagnosis you consider splenic \nrupture, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and ruptured ecto-\npic pregnancy. The lack of trauma argues against splenic rupture \nand the patient's age and gender are atypical for abdominal aortic \naneurysm. You wonder if in fact she has suffered from a ruptured \nectopic pregnancy. \nIt is important to remember the patient's chief \ncomplaint because it usually holds the most \nimportant clue to the diagnosis. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. P reports that she missed her last menstrual period. \nAn abdominal ultrasound Is performed and reveals 750 ml \nof fluid (presumed to be blood) In the pelvis. A urine preg-\nnancy test is positive. \nAlthough the final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was not consid-\nered initially, a careful clinical exam confirmed orthostatic syncope. \nOnce that pivotal clue was discovered, the differential diagnosis \ncould be narrowed and the underlying cause determined. It is \ninstructive to note that her initial HCT was normal because the \nremaining intravascular blood had not yet been diluted by any oral \nor IV fluids. \n\nInitial HCT measurements will not accurately \nreflect the magnitude of blood loss in a patient \nwith recent hemorrhage. \nMrs. P had 2 large bore IVs placed and was typed and \ncrossed for RBC transfusions. CBC, prothrombin time, \npartial thromboplastln time, and platelet counts were \nmeasured and a 1 L bolus of normal sallne was given whlle \nwaiting for the packed RBCs. After volume and blood resus-\ncrtation, she underwent surgical exploration and removal of \nher ruptured fallopian tube. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nAortic Stenosis \nTenbook Presentation \nAortic stenosis is usually diagnosed incidentally during routine \nexam rather than due to symptoms. Typically, aortic stenosis pm-\nduces a loud crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur at the right \nsecond intercostal space, which may radiate to the neck. When \naortic stenosis becomes severe, patients may have any of the 3 car-\ndinal symptoms: syncope, angina, or HF (dyspnea, typically with \nexertion). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Thickening and calcification of valve leaflets results in progres-\nsive obstruction to blood flow. \nB. LVH devdops to compensate for the obstruction. \nC. Pathophysiology of the cardinal symptoms is shown in \nFigure31-9. \nD. Prevalence is 3% in patients ~ 75 years old. \nE. Etiology: \n1. Most commonly due to calcification of a trileaflet aortic \nvalve \n2. Accderated in patients with congenital bicuspid valve \na. 1-2% of the population is born with a congenital \nbicuspid valve. \nb. Severe aortic stenosis develops in 66% of patients and \nat an earlier age than in patients with tricuspid valves. \nc. Aortic root structure is usually also abnormal and often \nassociated with progressive dilation of the aortic root \nthat may require repair to prevent rupture or dissection. \n3. Rheumatic heart disease \nF. Severe aortic stenosis is characterized by a valve area < 1 cm, \nassociated with an increased velocity across the aortic valve \n(;i: 4 m/s) and mean aortic valve gradient > 40 mm Hg. \nGradients and vdocities may be lower in patients with a lo\ncardiac output. \nG. Prognosis: Monality increases markedly when symptoms \ndevdop (HF, angina, or syncope). The most common symp-\ntoms are decreased exercise tolerance and dyspnea on exertion. \nMortality for symptomatic patients if they do not have valve \nreplacement: \n1. Aortic stenosis and angina: 50% 5-year mortality \n2. Aonic stenosis and syncope: 50% 3-year mortality \n3. Aortic stenosis and dyspnea: 50% 2-year mortality \nH. Other late manifestations: \n1. Atrial fibrillation may devdop. This is often poorly \ntolerated because the LV is noncompliant and dependent \non atrial contraction for filling. \n2. An increased bleeding tendency secondary to disruption \nof large von Willebrand multimers by the abnormal aortic \nvalve. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam: Most studies demonstrate only a \nfair reproducibility between examiners. \n1. Findings that help suggest aortic stenosis \na.

Patients with HF or a small hypertrophied LY may have \nlower florates across the AV, which may underestimate \nthe severity of aortic stenosis. \n5. Surveillance echocardiography is recommended to monitor \nprogression (every 6 months for severe aortic stenosis, and \nevery year for mild to moderate aortic stenosis associated \nwith significant calcification). Echocardiography is also \nrecommended for any change in symptoms or signs and \nduring pregnancy. \n6. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves and aortic stenosis \nor dilation of the aortic root (> 40 mm) should have \nannual echocardiography. In patients without stenosis \nor dilatation, echocardiography is recommended every \n2 years. \nC. Stress testing \n1. Should not be performed in patients with severe aortic \nstenosis and an ejection fraction < 50% or are symptomatic \n2. May be reasonable in asymptomatic patients with severe \naortic stenosis and a normal ejection fraction to confirm \nthe absence of symptoms. \nTreatment \nA. Since the prognosis changes markedly in symptomatic \npatients, patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis \nshould be reevaluated every 6 months and queried about \n\n556 I CHAPTER 31 \nHF symptoms, angina, or syncope. Patients should also be \ninstructed to report nesymptoms. \nB. Symptomatic: patients should undergo mec:hanic:al correction, \nnot medic:al therapy. \nC. While awaiting surgery, patients with HF symptoms may be \ntreated cautiously with diuretics, and ACE inhibitors \nD. Mec:hanic:al correction: \n1. Valve replacement is guided almost exclusively by \nsymptoms. \n2. Definite indications for valve replacement \na. Severe aortic: stenosis in symptomatic patients \nb. Severe aortic: stenosis with symptoms on exercise testing \nc. Severe aortic: stenosis in asymptomatic patients \nundergoing other cardiac surgery (eg, coronary artery \nbypass grafting). \nd. Severe aortic stenosis in asymptomatic patients with \nejection fraction < 50%. \n3. The 2014 AHA guidelines list several other \"reasonable\" \nindications for aortic: valve replacement including very \nsevere asymptomatic aortic: stenosis (vdocity > 5 m/s or \nmean gradient > 60 mm Hg) in low-risk patients. \n4. Standard preoperative evaluation includes angiography \nin many patients to determine whether the patient needs \nconcomitant coronary artery bypass surgery. This includes \npatients with symptoms of CAD, CAD risk factors \n(including men aged ~ 40 years, postmenopausal women,) \nor decreased ejection fraction. \n5. Three options for valve replacement are commonly used: \n(1) surgic:ally placed mec:hanic:al valves, (2) surgic:ally placed \nbioprosthetic valves, and (3) catheter-inserted bioprosthetic: \nvalves (transcatheter aortic valve replacement [TAVR]). \n6. Precise indications continue to evolve. Pertinent pros and \ncons of the options include: \na. TAVR does not require open heart surgery and \nis a reasonable alternative to surgic:al aortic valve \nreplacement for symptomatic patients with severe aortic: \nregurgitation when the surgic:al risk is intermediate \nto high. \n(1) As the name implies, the major advantage of these \nvalves is that they do not require open heart surgery \nbut are placed using a catheter, most commonly \ndeployed through the femoral artery. \n(2) The longevity of these bioprosthetic: TAVR valves is \nnot yet clear. \n(3) Perioperative MI, early major bleeding, acute \nkidney injury, and new-onset atrial fibrillation were \nless common with TAVR than surgical aortic valve \nreplacement, whereas early vascular complications, \nneed for pacemaker implantation, and perivalvuiar \nleaks were more common with TAVR. \n(4) These valves require dual antiplatdet therapy for \n3--6 months and then lifdong aspirin therapy. \nb. Surgically placed mechanical valves \n(1) Have greater durability and a significantly lower \nrate of fuilure and need for replacement, whic:h is \nparticularly important in patients younger than \nage 55 \n(2) However, they are associated with an increased \nrisk of thromboembolism and require lifelong \nanticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. \n(3) Direc:t-ac:ting oral anticoagulants are not \nrecommended. \n(4) In addition to warfa.rin, aspirin is recommended at \n75-100 mg/day. \nc. Surgically placed bioprosthetic valves \n(1) Require only brief anticoagulation with vitamin K \nantagonists (for the first 3-6 months following \nplacement) \n(2) However, have a limited longevity and are typically \nreserved for patients over age 65 (whose life \nexpectancy makes the need fur a second replacement \nunlikely). \n(3) Lifelong aspirin 75-100 mg/ day is recommended. \nd. Balloon valvotomy is a less commonly used option. \n(1) Can be used as a palliative procedure but is \nassociated with a high complication rate(> 10%) \nand provides only temporary relief (6-12 months) \n(2) Reserved for palliation in patients with other serious \n{or lethal) comorbidities and as a bridge to TAVR \nor aortic valve replacement in patients who are \nhemodynamically unstable or require urgent major \nnoncardiac surgery \nE. Vigorous exercise should be discouraged and vasodilators \n(hydralazine, niuoglycerin, and nifedipine} avoided or used \nwith caution in patients with moderate to severe aortic: \nstenosis. \nSituational Syncope \nA variant of reflex syncope, situational syncope occurs during or \nimmediatdy after micturition, defecation, swallowing, or cough-\ning, whic:h increase vagal tone. \nCarotid Sinus Syndrome \nTextbook Presentation \nCarotid sinus syndrome (CSS) is another variant of reflex syn-\ncope. Patients typically complain of syncope or falls that may be \nprecipitated when pre~ure is inadvertently applied to the carotid \n(eg, head turning, buttoning collar, shaving, or cervic:al motion) or \noccur spontaneously. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH) represents a syndrome of \nincreased carotid sensitivity with resultant hypotension due to \nbradyc:ardia, vasodilation, or both. \nB. Increasingly common in the dderly. Acc:ounts for 8-15% of \nsyncopal events in patients older than 40 years with syncope \nof unclear etiology. \nC. Mean age 77 and unusual in patients younger than 40 years. \nD. 15-56% of affected patients complain of falls but deny \nsyncope. \n1. May be due to retrograde amnesia or alternatively, \nhypotension that is insufficient to maintain an upright \nposture but sufficient to avoid frank loss of consciousness. \n2. CSS present in 19-27% of patienrs with unexplained falls \nbut 0% in patients with accidental falls. \n~ \nConsider CSS in elderly patients with unex-\n,.,.. plained falls. \n\nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Carotid sinus massage is used in the diagnosis of CSS. \n1. Carotid sinus massage is applied (unilaterally) for \n5-10 seconds during continuous ECG and BP monitoring. \nCarotid sinus massage needs to be performed on each side \nseparated in time by <! 1 minute and in both the supine and \nupright position. \n2. The inhibitory response is unilateral in 81 % of patients, \nsuggesting the need to evaluate both carotids. \n3. 30-50% of patients have findings only when upright. \n4. Carotid sinus massage has been complicated by transient \nor permanent neurologic symptoms in 0.24%. It is \ncontraindicated in patients with carotid bruits, known \ncarotid stenosis > 70%, recent cerebrovascular accident, \ntransient ischemic attack, or MI within the last 3 months. \nB. CSH should be distinguished from CSS. \n1. CSH is defined as a ?; 3-sccond pause or decrease in \nsystolic BP (~ 50 mm Hg) accompanying carotid sinus \nmassage. \n2. CSS is diagnosed in patients with a ?; 3-second pause \nor decrease in systolic BP (?: 50 mm Hg) accompanying \ncarotid sinus massage and syncope of unknown origin, \ncompatible with a reflex mechanism. \n3. Some authors also recommend diagnosing CSS in patients \nwith symptoms during carotid sinus massage and an \nabsolute systolic BP ~ 85 mm Hg to increase sensitivity \n(from 93% to 100%). \n4. CSH without concurrent syncope is nonspecific and not \ndiagnostic as it occurs in 35% of asymptomatic dderly \npatients without prior falls, dizziness, or syncope. \n5. CSS appears to be more specific. It affects only 5% of \ndderly patients without prior falls, dizziness, or syncope. \nAdditionally, although this elderly population with CSS \noften has other potential explanations for syncope (74%), \nalternative diagnoses were made in only 8% of patients in \nwhom CSS was diagnosed during follow-up. \nC. 47% of patients report symptoms precipitated by looking \nupward. \nTreattnent \nThe American Heart Association and European Society of Car-\ndiology concluded that pacemakers arc reasonable and should be \nconsidered in syncopal patients with cardioinhibitory CSS with \ndocumented asystolc of <! 3 sec with carotid sinus massage in \nSYNCOPE I 551 \nwhom they have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of \nsubsequent syncope and falls (from 38% to 9%). \nWolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome \nTextbook Presentation \nWPW syndrome may be asymptomatic or present with palpita-\ntions, dyspnea, near syncope, syncope, or sudden death. In some \npatients, the diagnosis may only be made after typical ECG find-\nings arc discovered on an ECG performed for some other reason. \nDisease Highlights \nA. A congenital disorder in which an accessory bundle directly \nconnects the atria and ventricular muscle bypassing the AV \nnode. \nB. While many patients with the WPW syndrome remain \nasymptomatic, a variety of life-threatening tachyarrhythmias \nmay occur: \n1. In orthodromic tachycardia, an impulse spreads down the \nrapidly conducting His-Purkinje system and then back up \nthe accessory pathway in a retrograde fashion (Figure 31-10) \nto the atria. Because the ventricle is activated by the \nHis-Purkinje system, the QRS complex is narrow. \n2. In antidromic tachycardia, the reentrant loop runs in the \nopposite direction down the accessory pathway. Since \nventricular depolarization starts at the insertion site of the \naccessory pathway (and not via the rapidly conducting \nHis-Purkinjc system), it depolarizes from cell to cell \nresulting in a wide complex tachycardia. \n3. Finally, atrial fibrillation or flutter can develop. The \naccessory pathway conducts impulses directly into \nthe ventricles (bypassing the AV node}, allowing very \nrapid ventricular depolarization and putting patients at \nrisk for ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. \nC. Syncope in patients with WPW syndrome is associated with a \ngreater frequency (25%} of rapid, life-threatening, conduction \nover the accessory pathway. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Baseline ECG abnormalities during normal sinus rhythm may \nreveal a combination of a short PR interval and a delta wave. \n1. Short PR interval(< 0.12 s) \na. In healthy persons, the normal PR interval is produced \nby a built-in delay at the AV node (designed to allo\natrial emptying prior to ventricular systole). \nFigure 31-10.

(Reproduced with permission from \nFuster V: Hurst's The Heart, 12th ed. NeYork. NY: McGraw-Hi 11 \nEducation; 2008.) \nb. In WPW syndrome, the accessory pathway bypasses the \nAV node and initiates ventricular depolarization without \nsuch a delay; this results in a shortened PR interval in \n75% of patients (Figure 31-11). \n2. Delta wave \na. In most patients with WPW syndrome, the accessory \npathway inserts directly into the ventricular muscle \n(rather than into the specialized His-Purkinje system). \nb. Ventricular depolarization spreads slowly from cell to \ncell through gap junctions, rather than rapidly through \nthe specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. \nc. This results in sloventricular depolarization and the \nsloinitial upstroke of the QRS complex known as the \ndelta wave (Figure 31-11). \nd. Finally, as this ventricular depolarization progresses, the \nAV node is also processing the supraventricular impulse. \nEventually, the impulse passes through the AV node, \nactivates the His-Purkinje system, and causes rapid \ndepolarization. This results in a narroterminal portion \nof the QRS complex. \nTreatment \nA. Risk stratification \n1. Stress tests: In certain patients, the accessory pathways \ncannot conduct at rapid heart rates, reducing the patient's \nrisk of life-threatening arrhythmias. This may be apparent \non stress tests if there is an abrupt loss of the delta wave and \nshort PR intervals at rapid heart rates. \n2. EPS can be useful for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. \na. EPS can confirm the presence of a bypass tract. \nb. EPS can measure the conduction characteristics of the \nbypass tract to determine if it can sustain rapid life-\nthreatening arrhythmias. \nc. Radio&equency ablation can obliterate the bypass tract \nin high-risk patients. \nd. An EPS is typically offered to the following patients: \n(1) Symptomatic patients {eg, history of tachycardia, \nsyncope, or sudden death) \n(2) Patients with structural heart disease who are at a \nhigher risk for atrial fibrillation \n(3) In selected asymptomatic patients whose stress test \ndoes not demonstrate loss of preexcitation at rapid \nheart rates \nB. Treatment \n1. Immediate management \na. A variety of options exist for patients with acute WPW-\nrelated arrhythmias, including electrical cardioversion \nand pharmacotherapy. \nb. The choice of pharmacotherapy depends on the \nmechanism of the tachycardia. \nc. Consultation is recommended. \n2. Long-term management \na. Long-term therapeutic options include pharmacologic \ntherapy and radio&equency catheter ablation of the \nbypass tract. \nb. Radio&equency ablation can be performed if the risk of \nrapid tachycardias is high. \nc. Consultation is recommended. \nREFERENCES \nAlboni P, Brignole M, Mcnozzi C et al.

She is worried that she has \nsomething serious. \n~ \nWhat is the diffensntial diagnosie of \n1~1' unintentional weight loee1 Howould you \nframe the diffensntla11 \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nSignificant unintentional weight loss is defined as > 5% loss of usual \nbody weight in the last 6--12 months and can be a harbinger of \nserious underlying disease. One study documented significantly \nincreased mortality in men with unintentional weight loss compared \nwith men whose weight was stable or increased (36% vs \"' 15%). \nThe evaluation of unintentional weight loss is complicated by its \nfrequency among older adults; 15-20% of adults over 65 years of \nage may have unintentional weight loss, and the prevalence rises to \n50-60% among nursing home residents. Body weight usually peaks \nabout age 60 and then decreases gradually thereafter, especially after \nage 70, although the normal changes are small(< 1 lb/year). \nIt should be noted that weight loss in the elderly is often part \nof an overall syndrome of functional decline called frailty, which \nincludes weakness, slowness, lolevel of physical activity, self-\nreported exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss. When present, \nfrailty has significant implications for morbidity and mortality in \nthe elderly and frail patients have substantially higher morbidity \nand monality that their age-matched peers. \nThere are a large number of diseases that can cause uninten-\ntional weight loss, which are best organi:zed by system (see below). \nThe most common causes of unintentional weight loss in pub-\nlished studies are cancer (most commonly gastrointestinal [GI] but \nalso lung, lymphoma, and other malignancies),\"' 19-36%; depres-\nsion and alcoholism, 16%; nonmalignant GI diseases, 13%; and \nunknown, 22%. Endocrine disorders account for 7% of uninten-\ntional weight loss. Although cancer is the most common cause, \nit is not the cause in most patients. Mild cognitive impairment \nand dementia may also cause weight loss due to a combination \nof increased energy expenditure (due to agitation and pacing) and \ndecreased caloric intake. \nFour pivotal points are worth remembering when evaluating \npatients with unintentional weight loss (Figure 32-1). First, the \nweight loss should be documented if possible; 25-50% of patients \nthat complain of unintentional weight loss have not in fact lost \nweight (and do not need to be evaluated for causes of weight loss). \nElderly adults often lose muscle mass and simply look like they \nlost weight. Weight loss should be documented by comparing prior \nweights or, if these are unavailable, by finding a significant decrease \nin a patient's clothing and/or belt size. It may also be helpful to \nsee corroborating information from family and/or caretakers and \ntrying to elicit a specific amount of weight loss from the patient. \nClinicians should verify the weight loss or \ndocument significant changes in the patient's \nclothing or belt size. \nThe second pivotal step identifies patients with malabsorption. \nPatients should be asked about changes in their bowel movements, \nincluding diarrhea or large, difficult to flush or malodorous stools. \nAlthough an uncommon cause of unintentional weight loss, such \nsymptoms suggest small bowel or pancreatic disease and direct \nthe diagnostic search. Additionally, difficulty with defecation or \nchanges in stool caliber raises the possibility of colorectal cancer. \nThe third pivotal step differentiates weight loss that is due to \ndecreased caloric intake from weight loss that is due to increased \ncaloric expendimre or malabsorption. Most patients lose weight \ndue to decreased caloric intake. Weight loss associated with normal \nor increased intake suggests substantial catabolism or energy loss \nthat may be seen in patients with cancer, severe chronic obstruc-\ntive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption, or poorly \ncontrolled diabetes. \nFourth and most imponantly: a clinician is most likely to be \nsuccessful in identifying the cause of a patient's unintentional \nweight loss if she identifies the \"company it keeps.\" Clinicians \nshould perform a truly comprehensive history (including a revie\nof systems, psychosocial history, and medication history) and per-\nform a detailed head to toe physical exam (with special attention \nto the mental status exam) to identify any abnormalities. An initial \nbaseline laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood \ncount (CBC) with differential, urinalysis, renal panel, calcium, \nhepatic panel, fasting glucose, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), ery-\nthrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid-stimulating hormone \n(TSH), HN test, and chest radiograph. Abnormal, or potentially \nabnormal, findings discovered on history, physical exam, or ini-\ntial labs are rarely conclusively diagnostic but often provide critical \nclues to the underlying diagnosis and should be thoroughly evalu-\nated. Examples of such findings include anemia, which may be due \nto iron deficiency from an unsuspected carcinoma of the colon or \nstomach; an elevated alkaline phosphatase, which may be due to \nmetastatic disease to the liver or bones; hematuria, which may be \ndue to carcinoma of the kidney or bladder; or a markedly elevated \nESR, which may be due to multiple myeloma, temporal arteritis, \nsubacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), or other chronic infection. \nAdditionally, recommended preventive health exams should be \nbrought up to date (eg, mammogram, Papanicolaou exam with \nhuman papillomavirus testing, colonoscopy or other appropriate \ncolorectal cancer screening, prostate-specific antigen in selected \n\n562 I CHAPTER 32 \nNo weight loss \nor change in \nclothing size \nDiarrhea or fatty \noily or difficult to \nflush stools \nS1opworkup \nSee Figure 32-4, \nTable32-8 \nNormal \nASHU for di ...... auoclaled with \nlncreued catabollsm or calorie Ion \nor \n- Cancer \nincreased \n- Hyperthyroidism \nPMH \nPsychosocial: \nINITIAL EVALUATION HISTORY \n- Poorly controlled diabetes \n- Severa COPD \n- Malabsorptlon \nFinancial or social stressors: living arrangements (or change); bereavement, feelings of hopelessness, down or anhedonia, alcohol screen, \nillicit drug use; sexual history; tobacco use \nComprehensive ROS1 \nMedications: \nOver-the-counter and prescription (eg, dlgoxln, loop diuretics, dlltlazem, levodopa); medical diets, radiation \nPHYSICAL EXAM \nComprehensive exam: Include oral, thyroid, breast, lymph node, peMc and rectal exam and Mini-mental exam In patients over 60 years \nLaboratory Evaluatlon \nScreening labs: CBC differential, renal panel, liver panel, fasting glucose, ESR, Ca++, TSH,HIV; urinalysis, chest film; FOBT \nUpdate health maintenance exams (mammogram, PAP exam, colonoscopy, low-dose chest CT scan in select patients2) \n~ \n~ \n,ROS should include: \nNo \nCerdlOVllSCuler: Shortness of breath, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, history of valvular heart disease or endocarditis \nEndocrine: Heat intolerance, tremulousness, palpitations, polyuria, polydipsia \nGutrolnllllltlnal: Altered taste, smell, ill-fitting dentures, odynophagia, dysphagia, abdominal pain, NSAID use, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficult to \nflush stools, jaundice, dark urine, history of hepatitis, change in bowel habits, oonstipation, hematochezia, melena \nHemlltOloglc: Lymph node swelling, night sweal8 \nlnfaclloue: Fevsr, chills, rash \nNeurologic: Impaired memory, headaches, resting tremor, history of stroke \nRespiratory: Cough, hemoptysis, severe dyspnea, PPD or IGRA +, foreign bom \nRenal: History of renal disease, prurttus \nRheumatologic: Joint or muscle pain, rash, alopecia \n2USPSTF 2013 reoommands annual low-dose chest CT scans for patients aged 55-80 with ~ 30 pack year smoking history who currently \nsmoke or quit ,s; 15 years previously). \nCBC, complete blood count; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ESR, erythrocylB sedimentation rate; FOBT, fecal occult blood test; \nIGRA, interferon-gamma release assay; PMH, past medical history; PPD, purified protein derivative; ROS, revieof systems. \nFigure 32-1.

Figure 32-1 illustrates \nthe diagnostic approach. \nInterestingly, an unrevealing initial evaluation is reassuring: one \nstudy conducted in patients with weight loss showed that among \nthose who underwent evaluation, none of those without abnormal \nor concerning findings on the initial evaluation were diagnosed \nwith cancer during the study. A more recent, larger study showed \nthat cancer may be undiagnosed antemonem but discovered on \nautopsy; this suggests that, while the rate of cancers diagnosed on \nfollow-up (after the initial evaluation) is low, cancers may still be \npresent and thus warrant ongoing clinical follow-up. \nDifferential Diagnosis of Involuntary \nWeight Loss \nThe differential diagnosis of weight loss is extensive and best \norganized by system. \nA.

Chronic pain \n5. Frailty syndrome \n\nMrs. M reports that she has Jost weight over the last \n6 months and notes that her appetite Is not as good as \nprevtously. She does not weigh herself and is unsure of ho\nmany pounds she has lost. \n~ \nAt thh!t point, what le the leading hypothe9le, \n1~ r what are the active alternatlve9, and 19 \nthere a must not miee diagnoeie7 Given this \ndifferential diagnoeie, what teete ehould be \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe patient's relatively nonspecific history is typical of many \npatients complaining of weight loss. Patients report an unspecified \namount of weight loss that is associated with anorexia. The first \npivotal step in the evaluation is to verify that weight loss has, in \nfact, occurred. \n\nMrs. M Is neto the cllnlc and prior weights are unavailable. \nWhile Mrs. M does not knohomany pounds she has lost, \nshe does report that her clothes are much too loose and \nshe has needed to buy pants that are 2 sizes smaller. \nMrs. M's change in clothing size suggests true and significant \nweight loss. The second pivotal step in evaluating patients with \ndocumented weight loss determines whether the patient has symp-\ntoms suggestive of malabsorption, such as diarrhea or floating \nstools. \n\nMrs. M does reports that she has a bowel movement daily \nor every other day. She notes no dlarrhea. no floating or dlf-\nflcu lt to flush stools, and no change Jn her bowel habits over \nthe last several years. \nSince the history does not suggest diarrhea or malabsorption, \nthe third pivotal step in the evaluation of patients with uninten-\ntional weight loss differentiates weight loss due to decreased caloric \nintake or absorption from that due to increased caloric expenditure. \nMrs. M.'s initial complaint already clarified that her weight loss \nwas due to anorexia and decreased caloric intake. The fourth step \nis a comprehensive, S)75tem-based approach utilizing a thorough \nhistory, (including a past medical history, detailed psychosocial \nhistory, and revieof S}'5tems}, ph)75ical exam, basic laboratory \ntests, and completion of her age-appropriate health maintenance \nexaminations to search for diagnostic clues. \n\nMrs. M's past medical history is unrevealing, including a \nreviein the Electronic Health Record. Her psycho50Clal \nhistory Is also unrevealing. She lives with her husband (who \nIs In good health), and t hey have no difficulty obtaining or \ncooking food. She has never smoked tobacco and drinks \nalcohol rarely. The revieof systems is negative in detail. \nOn physical exam, Mrs. M looks cachectlc and fatigued. \nHer vital sl!:!ns are normal. HEENT exam reveals no oral \nlesions or adenopathy. Lungs are clear to percussion and \nauscultation. Cardiac exam reveals a normal rate and reg-\nular rhythm. with a grade JI flosystolic murmur along \nthe left sternal border without radiation. Her abdomen Is \nscaphold, without hepatosplenomegaly or mass. FOBT Is \nnegative. Neurologic exam is normal, incluc:iing a Mini- Mental \nState Exam on which her score is 29/30. \n~ \nle the cllnical information eufficlent to make a \n1~1\" diagnoeie1 If not, what other information do \nyouneed1 \nUnfortunatdy, like many patients with unintentional weight \nloss, Mrs. M has no specific clues to suggest any particular diag-\nnosis. Given her cachectic appearance (suggesting her weight loss \nis real despite the lack of documentation) and the fact that cancer \nis the most common cause of unintentional weight loss and a \nmust not miss hypothesis, it is the leading hypothesis that must \nbe evaluated at this point. Her tired appearance also raises the \npossibility of depression (which could be either a primary psychi-\natric disorder or a reaction to an underlying medical condition). \nFinally, nonmalignant GI disease should also be considered, since \nit is also a common cause of unintentional weight loss. Hyperthy-\nroidism is also on the differential. Table 32-1 lists her differential \ndiagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: Cancer Cachexia \nTenbook Presentation \nPatients with cancer cachexia often have advanced disease. Weight \nloss in cancer may be due to decreased caloric intake (anorexia}, \nincreased caloric expendicure, or both. They may have other symp-\ntoms specific to their particular malignancy. The cancer may have \nbeen diagnosed before the weight loss or the weight loss may lead \nto the diagnosis. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Cancer diagnoses account for up to 36% of cases of unexplained \nweight loss. \nB. The most common malignancies associated with weight loss \nare GI, lung, and lymphoma. \nC. Weight loss is one of the most common presenting \nsymptoms in patients with lung cancer (comparable to \ncough). It is more frequent than dyspnea, hemoptysis, \nor chest pain. \nD. Unintentional weight loss is common in cancer patients. At \nthe time of diagnosis, 24% of patients with cancer have lost \nweight. \nE. Weight loss increases the risk of immobility, deconditioning, \nand adversely affects immunity. The risk. of pulmonary \nembolism, pressure injuries (formerly pressure ulcers}, and \npneumonia are increased. \n\nTable 32-1.

Patient estimation of weight loss compared to actual \nmeasurement \n1. In patients who overestimated their weight loss (by more \nthan 0.5 kg), cancer was unlikely (6%) and no organic \ncause was found in 73%. \n2. In patients who underestimated their weight loss (by more \nthan 1 kg), cancer was diagnosed in 52%. \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 565 \nB. Several studies have evaluated the history, physical exam, and \ninitial laboratory studies to aid in the detection of cancer in \npatients with unintentional weight loss. \nC. Laboratory studies usually included a CBC, chemical survey \n(including glucose, calcium, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], \ncreatinine, and liver biochemical tests), HIV when appro-\npriate, ESR, TSH, C-reactive protein (CRP), urinalysis, and \nchest radiograph. Several of these studies also incorporated \nabdominal ultrasound. \nD. Further work-up was dictated by abnormalities detected in \nthe initial evaluation. (For instance, GI evaluation with upper \nendoscopy and colonoscopy would be initiated in patients \nwith GI complaints or iron deficiency anemia; hepatobiliary \nand pancreatic imaging would be done in those with abdomi-\nnal pain or abnormal liver biochemical tests, etc.) \n1. Cancer was detected in 14-28% of patients in these \nstudies. \n2. The battery was 93% sensitive for the detection of cancer \nin patients with unintentional weight loss. \n3. The rate of occult cancer in patients for whom an initial \nevaluation was unrevealing is low(< 5%). \nTreatment \nCancer is an unlikely cause of weight loss \nin patients with a negative initial evalua-\ntion (including appropriate follow-up of \nabnormalities). \nA. Nutritional support \n1. In many patients, artificial nutritional support is not \neffective. \n2. Certain subgroups of patients may benefit from nutritional \nsupport; these are generally patients with a reversible \nmechanical cause leading to inadequate oral intake. \na. Head and neck cancer (after radiation therapy) \nb. Bowel obstruction \nc. Surgery patients (particularly upper GI tract cancer} \nd. Patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy \n3. Enteral support is strongly favored when possible over \nparenteral nutrition. \nB. Treat underlying malignancy \nC. Medroxyprogesterone and megestrol \n1. Decreases nausea and anorexia and increases weight gain \n2. May increase the risk of thromboernbolic events \n3. Other side effects include hyperglycernia, endometrial \nbleeding, edema, hypertension, and adrenal suppression \nand insufficiency \nD. Corticosteroids \n1. Decrease anorexia and nausea \n2. Increase appetite, quality of life, and feeling of well~being \n3. Because of the side effects, corticosteroids are often reserved \nfor patients with terminal disease. \nE. A variety of other medications have been tried with limited to \nno success. \n1. Prokinetic dtugs (metoclopramide) can decrease anorexia \nand nausea but did not increase appetite or caloric intake. \n2. The cannabinoid dronabinol was less effective than \nprogestins. \n\n566 I CHAPTER 32 \n3. Other agents under study include gherlin, melatonin, ATP \ninfusions, and oxandrolone. \n4. Studies about the use of cannabis are lacking despite \nincreasing availability for medical use. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nClearly, a diagnosis is not yet apparent on history or physical exam \nfor Mrs. M. The data suggest that when the cause of unintentional \nweight loss is malignant, there are usually clues on history, physical \nexam, or on laboratory testing. You elect to check a CBC, liver \npanel, renal panel, urinalysis, chest radiograph, and screening \nmammogram. Finally, you elect to schedule Mrs. M for a colonos--\ncopy, since she has never undergone colon cancer screening. You \ndiscuss that this is different than usual age-appropriate colon can-\ncer screening, for which she is above the age at which screening is \nstill recommended; this is a diagnostic evaluation with a substan-\ntially different pretest probability. \n\n5urprlslngly, Mrs. M's laboratory evaluation Is normal. Her \nCBC Is normal wtthout evidence of Iron deficiency anemla \n(which could have suggested gastric or colorectal cancer). \nThe chest radiograph is also normal, making lu~ cancer \nunlikely, particularly in a patient who never smoked. ALT, \nAST. alkallne phosphatase, and bilirubln were normal and her \nkidney function Is normal. Her HIV test Is negative and there \nwas no hematurla on urinalysis (which could SU0(:lest renal \ncell carcinoma or bladder cancer). Her mammogram and \ncolonoscopy were normal. \n~ \nHave you crossed a diagnoetic threshold for \n1~JI\"\" the leading hyPOthesis, canc;sr c;ac;hsxia? Have \nyou ruled out the actlv8 alt8rnatlWJe1 Do \noth8r t8sts n1Jsd to be d0!18 to exc;luds the \nalt8rnatlvs dlagnosH1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Depression \nTextbook Presentation \nDepression may folloa recogni7.able loss or occur without a clear \nprecipitant. Classically, patients complain of profound sadness, lack \nof interest in activities (anhedonia), sleep and appetite disturbances, \nimpaired concentration, and other symptoms. Patients may lose or \ngain weight. Patients may experience suicidal or homicidal thoughts. \nDisease Higblighu \nA. Point prevalence of major depressive disorder (MOD) is \n5-13%. Lifetime prevalence of MOD is 16.2%, and minor \ndepression is twice as common. \nB. Depression is the second most common condition seen in pri-\nmary care practices and the fourth leading cause of disability. \nC. Recurrences are common, up to 50% in 1 year, and many \npatients require lifelong therapy. \nD. Risk factors for major depression \n1. Prior episode of depression \n2. Postparrum period \n3. Comorbid medical illness \n4. Older age \n5. Concomitant neurologic disease \n6. Chronic pain \n7. Absence of social support \n8. Female sex (2-3 times more common than in males) \n9. Family history (first-degree relative) \n10. Stressful life events (must be differentiated from adjustment \ndisorder) \n11. Substance abuse/dependence \n12. Unemployment and losocioeconomic status \nE. Associated anxiety: 50% of patients with depression have \nanxiety symptoms \n1. 10-20% of patients with MOD have evidence of panic \ndisorder and 30--40% have evidence of generalized anxiety \ndisorder. \n2. Patients with anxiety and MOD are at higher risk for \nsuicide. \nF. Minor depression \n1. 10-18% progress to major depression within 1 year. \n2. 20% have moderate to severe disability. \nEvidence-Based Diagnos.U \nA. The DSM-5 criteria for MOD require 5 of the following \n9 criteria (1 of which is depressed mood or anhedonia) for \nat least 2 weeks: \n1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day \n2. Anhedonia with \"marked diminished interest or pleasure \nin all or almost all activities\" \n3. Significant appetite or weight change (> 5% of body weight \nin 1 month not associated with dieting) \n4. Sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia) \n5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation \n6. Fatigue \n7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt \n8. Impaired concentration \n9. Suicidal ideation \nB. These criteria must be associated with significant distress or \nimpaired functioning and not be secondary to substance abuse \nor another medical condition; in addition, there should be no \nprior history of mania (which would be diagnostic of a bipolar \ndisorder). \nC. Minor depression requires 2-4 of the above symptoms, \nincluding anhedonia or depressed mood for > 2 weeks. \nD. There are multiple validated screening tools for depression, \nincluding the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), \nthe 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the \nGeriatric Depression Scale. \nE. Severity can be estimated using the Hamilton Rating Depres-\nsion Scale. Scores of s 18 are classified as mild to moderate, \n19-22 as severe, and~ 23 as very severe depression. \nF. The sadness that accompanies major loss (grief), as in \nbereavement, may be difficult to distinguish from MOD and \nthe 2 may coexist. Profound sadness, anorexia, insomnia, and \nweight loss may occur. Features that suggest grief (rather than \nMOD) include: \n1. The ability to have periods of happiness or pleasure in grief \nthat is often absent in MOD. \n2. Sadness in grief is often episodic rather than pervasive and \nconstant. \n\n3. In grief, the focus of sadness is typic:ally on loss rather than \nself-loathing or worthlessness seen in MDD. \nG. Screening \n1. Depression is often missed on routine evaluation. In \npatients in whom depression was subsequently diagnosed, \nonly 8.8% were found to be depressed during the routine \ninterview. \n2. Screening tools increase the identification of patients \nwith depression by 2- to 3-fold (an absolute increase of \n10- 47%). Again, specific validated screening tools allo\nfor standardization, and are easily used in primary care \nworkflows. Furthermore, screening coupled with treatment \ndecreases clinical morbidity. \nDepression is frequently missed in unstruc-\nmred clinical encounters. Screening tools are \ninvaluable aids to its diagnosis. \n3. Screening is recommended by the US Preventive Services \nTask Force (USPSTF). \n4. 2 screening questions perform as well as more complex tools \n(a positive response to either question is considered positive). \na. \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt down, depressed, \nor hopeless?\" \nb. \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt little interest or \npleasure in doing things?\" \nc. Sensitivity, 96-97%; specificity, 57-67%; LR+, 2.2-2.9; \nLR-, 0.04-0.07 \nd. Patients with a positive response to either question \nshould undergo a full diagnostic evaluation to determine \nif they meet diagnostic criteria fur depression and to \nexclude a history of mania. \n5. Clinic:al clues that might suggest a patient is depressed include \na. Recent stress or loss \nb. Chronic medic:al illness, chronic pain syndromes \nc. > 6 physical symptoms \nd. Higher patient ratings of symptom severity \ne. Lower patient rating of overall health \n Physician perception of encounter as difficult \ng. Substance abuse (23% have MDD) \nb. Functional restriction is greater than explained by their \nmedic:aJ illness. \ni. The language used to describe their condition is extreme \n(terrible, unbearable, etc). \nj. Sleep disturbances \n6. Many medic:aJ illnesses cause weight loss and depression \n(eg, 20-45% of patients with cancer are depressed, and \n40% of patients with Parkinson disease are depressed). \nEven in patients with depression, care must be taken before \nascribing weight loss solely to depression. \nThe diagnosis of depression does not exclude \nother serious illnesses causing unintentional \nweight loss. Patients should be monitored to \nensure weight gain or stabilization following \ntreatment of their depression. \nThe evaluation of a depressed patient with \nweight loss should include a complete physical \nexamination and revieof systems to avoid \npremature closure. \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 567 \nTreatment \nA. Work-up should include a full psychosocial history, including \ndegree of functional impairment, history of domestic violence, \nand a drug history to look for agents that can worsen or \nprecipitate depression (opioids, alcohol, interferon, L-dopa, \ncorticosteroids, oral contraceptives, propranolol, cocaine). \nB. Patients should be screened for a history of manic symptoms \nthat suggest bipolar illness (periods of reduced need for sleep, \nimpulsivity, euphoric mood, racing thoughts, increased sexual \nactivity, and grandiosity). \nC. Screening tests (ie, TSH, basic metabolic panel, liver bio-\nchemic:aJ tests, CBC) are recommended to rule out medic:aJ \nconditions (eg, hypothyroidism) that can simulate or cause \ndepression. \nD. Assess suicide risk: Ideation, intent, or plan \n1. Have you been having thoughts of dying? \n2. Do you have a plan? \n3. Does patient have the means (eg, weapons) to carry out \ntheir plan? \n4. Risk factors include \na. Older men \nb. Psychotic symptoms \nc. Alcohol or other substance abuse \ncl History of prior attempts \ne. Family history of suicide or recent exposure to suicide \n5. Risk factors for suicide attempts in black patients included \nyoung age (OR 9.4), less than high school education \n(OR 3.6), mood disorder (OR 3.8). anxiety disorder \n(OR 6.0), and substance abuse (OR 4.5}. \n6. Emergent psychiatric evaluation should be performed \nin suicidal patients who have risk factors, who appear \nintoxicated, cannot contract for safety, or have poor social \nsupport. \nE. Pharmacotherapy \n1. Based on the number of symptoms and functional \nimpairment \n2. Not influenced by whether or not there is well-defined \nprecipitant (ie, stress). Therapy should be strongly \nconsidered in grieving patients with persistent symptoms of \nMDD for more than 2 months after a loss. \n3. Multiple classes of medications are effective: SSRis, \nserotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRis), \ntricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase \ninhibitors (MAOis}. \n4. A patient-level meta-analysis reported that pharmacotherapy \nwas effective. The benefit is most marked in patients with \nvery severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Sc:aJe \n2 25). The numbers needed to treat are 16, 11, and 4 for \npatients with mild to moderate, severe, and very severe \ndepression, respectivdy. \n5. SSRis are often used as first-line agents due to lo\nfrequency of adverse effects and safety in overdose. \nBoth SSRis and SNRis may cause sexual dysfunction. \nVenlafaxine (an SNRI) can be lethal in overdose. \n6. Caution is recommended in the use of SSRis in certain age \ngroups: \na. The USPSTF concluded that fair evidence suggests \nthat SSRis increase suicidal behaviors in patients \n18-29 years of age, especially those with MDD who \n\n568 I CHAPTER 32 \nreceive paroxetine (OR 6.7; Cl, 1.1-149.4). The risk \nwas highest in the first month of treatment. \nb. For those age groups, alternative medications or \npsychotherapy may be preferred. \n7. Minazapine may be useful in patients with weight loss, \npoor appetite, and insomnia and bupropion may be useful \nin patients with daytime lethargy and fatigue. \n8. TCAs frequently cause troubling anticholinergic side \neffects (including dysrhythmias}, significant weight gain \n(> 20 lbs) and are dangerous in overdose, so they are used \nless frequently. High-dose TCAs may increase the risk of \nsudden cardiac death. \n9. MAOis interact with a variety of tyramine-containing \nfoods and medications and may precipitate a hypertensive \ncrisis. Typically, only psychiatrists prescribe these. \n10. Patients with a prior history of manic symptoms should be \nreferred for psychiatric evaluation prior to the institution of \nantidepressant therapy. Antidepressant therapy can trigger \nmania. \n11. Continue treatment for 6-9 months afar clinical recovery. \n12. Patients with multiple recurrences (~ 2-3) may require \nlifetime therapy. \nF. Psychotherapy \n1. Equally effective as pharmacotherapy in patients with \nmild to moderate depression. Options include cognitive \nbehavioral therapy, problem-solving therapy, and \ninterpersonal psychotherapy. \n2. Less effective than pharmacotherapy in patients with \nsevere depression. Combined psychotherapy and \npharmacotherapy may be the best option. \nG. Exercise programs may be helpful in older adults with mild to \nmoderate depression. \nH. Electroconvulsive therapy is an alternative therapy for patients \nwith severe, refractory depression, particularly those with \npsychotic or suicidal features. \nI. Indications for referral include psychotic feamres; substance \nabuse; panic disorder; agitated, severe, or relapsing depression; \nbipolar features; suicidality; and dysthymia. \n\nMrs. M reports no unusual stresses or losses.

Her score on the PHQ-2 instrument is 0. \nMrs. M's answers to the screening questions make depression \nhighly unlikely (LR- 0.07). Although her appearance seems anti-\nthetical to what you knoabout hyperthyroidism, you wonder if \nthat possibility should be pursued. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism \nTextbook Presentation \nClassical symptoms include palpitations, heat intolerance, \nincreased sweating, insomnia, tremulousness, diarrhea, and weight \nloss. Signs of hyperthyroidism include sinus tachycardia, systolic \nhypertension, frightened stare, an enlarged goiter, a fine resting \ntremor, and exophthalmos (only if hyperthyroidism is second-\nary to Graves disease). Other manifestations may include hyper-\npigmentation, irregular menses, pruritus, and thinning of hair. \nComplications that occur over time include osteoporosis, tracheal \nobstruction or dysphagia (from the goiter), tachyarrhythmias \n(particularly atrial fibrillation), high output heart failure, anemia, \nand proximal muscle weakness. \nDisease Highlights \nA Prevalence, 0.3%. \nB. Hyperthyroidism is actually an endocrine syndrome caused by \nseveral distinct pathophysiologic entities (Table 32-2). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA History and physical exam \n1. Certain findings of hyperthyroidism are quite specific \n(ie, lid lag and lid retraction) and help rule in the diagnosis \n(specificity, 99%; LR+, 17-32). \n2. However, clinical findings are not highly sensitive. \nTherefore, absent clinical findings do not rule out \nhyperthyroidism. \na. Gaiter is present in 70-93% of cases. \nb. Pulse > 90 bpm is present in 80% of cases. \nc. Lid lag is present in 19% of cases. \nd. Ophthalmopathy is present in 25-50% of patients with \nGraves disease. \ne. Hyperreflexia is variable depending on the age of the \npatient. \nB. Elderly patients \n1. Prevalence of hyperthyroidism in the elderly is 2-3%. \n2. Hyperthyroidism often presents atypically in elderly \npatients. Expected adrenergic findings are often absent, \nwhereas atrial fibrillation is more common, resulting in \nthe phenomenon referred to as apathetic hyperthyroidism \nof the elderly. Table 32-3 compares the findings in young \nand older patients with hyperthyroidism. \nConsider hyperthyroidism in elderly patients with \nweight loss (OR 8.7), tachycardia (OR 11.2), \natrial fibrillation, or apathy (OR 14.8). Hyper-\nthyroidism was not even considered initially in \n54% of admitted patients in whom hyperthy-\nroidism was subsequently diagnosed. \nC. Laboratory tests \n1. TSH is the test of choice for hyperthyroidism (in the absence \nof pituitary disease) (sensitivity > 99%, specificity > 99%, \nLR+, > 99, LR-, < .01). \na. LoTSH usually indicates hyperthyroidism. \nb. Normal TSH usually indicates euthyroidism. \nc. High TSH usually indicates hypothyroidism. \n2. Exceptions to the above occur when the pituitary itself is \ndiseased (rare). \na. Pituitary adenomas can produce TSH, causing \nhyperthyroidism with increased TSH and free T4. \nb. Pituitary dysfunction or destruction (eg, from sarcoidosis \nor tumors) results in hypothyroidism with decreased \nTSH and freeT4. \n\nTable 32-2.

An approach to thyroid function tests is shown in \nFigure 32-2. \n6. Established hyperthyroidism \na.

Beta-blockers can be used primarily to decrease the symptoms \narising from the sympathetic stimulation including the tremor, \ntachycardia, palpitations, and sweating. \nB. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on underly-\ning etiology. \n1. Graves disease or toxic multinodular gaiter: Options \ninclude antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine or surgery. \na. Antithyroid drugs {methimazole, carbimazole and \npropylthiouracil) \n(1) Act rapidly \n(2) Rarely cause agranulocytosis (0.1-0.3%) \n(3) \"' 40% of patients relapse \n(4) Require frequent monitoring \n(5) Methimazole is preferred over propylthiouracil due \nto its more rapid onset of action and lower incidence \nof hepatotoxicity. However, propylthiouracil is \npreferred for women in their first trimester of \npregnancy or patients in thyroid storm. \nb. Radioactive iodine \n(1) Used successfully for over 60 years. \n(2) = 21 % relapse rate \n(3) Pretreatment with antithyroid drugs is advised for \nsome patients. \n(4) Contraindications include pregnancy, lactation, and \nsevere ophthalmopathy. \n(S) Results in permanent hypothyroidism and the \nrequirement for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement. \nc. Surgery \n(1) Occasionally used, particularly if the goiter is \ntroublesome. \n(2) Pretreatment with antithyroid drugs is advised for \nsome patients. \n(3) Results in permanent hypothyroidism and the \nrequirement for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement. \n(4) Complications may include hypoparathyroidism, \nrecurrent laryngeal nerve damage, and postoperative \nthyroid storm. \n2. Subacute thyroiditis \na. Aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs) decrease thyroid inflammation. Prednisone \ncan be used in severe cases. \nb. Hyperthyroidism is usually transient and does not \nrequire antithyroid drugs. Beta-blockers are used \nto decrease symptoms of hyperthyroidism until the \ninflammation subsides. \nc. Transient mild hypothyroidism may devdop as the \nthyroiditis resolves. Occasionally, treatment with \nlevothyroxine is required. \n\nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. M's TSH is completely suppressed ( < 0.1 microunits/ml ). \nThe T4 is elevated at 20 mcg/dl (nl 5-11.6 mcg/dl) and \nthe free T4 ls 3.6 (nl 0.0-1.8 ng/L). You diagnose primary \nhyperthyroidism. A thyroid scan reveals heterogeneous \nuptake consistent with a toxic multlnodular gaiter. \n~ \nCheck the TSH on every patlent evaluated for \ny \nweight loss. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. 0 Is a 55-year-old man who complalns of weight loss. He \nreports that he has tried for years to lose weight (unsuc-\ncessfully) but that recently he has lost more and more \nweight without effort. He was initially pleased but recently \nhas become concerned. He reports that he has lost \n30 pounds In the last6 months (from 200lbsto170 lbs). \nAt this point, what Is the leadlng hyPOthesls, \nwhat are the active altematlvee, ant.I le \nthere a must not miss diagnosis? Given this \ndifferential diagnoeie, what teete &hould bB \nordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAs noted above, the first pivotal seep in the evaluation of unin-\ntentional weight loss is to verify the weight loss. Mr. 0 has clearly \nsuffered from verifiable significant unintentional weight loss. The \nsecond pivotal step in the evaluation of patlents with documented \nweight loss is to determine whether or not the patient is having \nsymptoms that suggest malabsorption. \n\nMr. 0 reports no dlarrhea, large foul-smelling stools, or diffi-\ncult to flush stools. He reports that he previously moved his \n1:7owels once a day but lately only once every other day. He \nattributes this to his decreased appetite and decreased \noral Intake. \nSince Mr. O's weight loss is not obviously secondary to mal-\nabsorption, the focus turns to the third pivotal step, which differ-\nentiates weight loss due to decreased caloric intake or absorption \nfrom that due to increased caloric expenditure. Like many patlents \nwith weight loss Mr. 0 clearly notes a decreased oral intake and \nthe evaluatlon focuses on the fourth pivotal seep; a comprehensive, \nsystem-based approach utilizing a thorough history, (including a \npast medical history, detailed psychosocial history, and revieof \nsystems), physical exam, basic laboratory tests and completion of \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 571 \n\nDue to her advanced age, you elect to have her treated \nwith radioactive Iodine. Six months later she retums; she \nis taking replacement levothyroxine for t he radioactive \nIodine-Induced hypothyroidism. Lal:7oratory exam reveals \nthat she Is euthyrold and she feels well. She has gained \n10 pounds. \nage-appropriate health maintenance examinations to search for \ndiagnostic clues that will guide further evaluation. \nMr. 0 notes that he has a decreased appetite and feels \nfull quickly after starting to eat. His past medical history \nIs unremarl::aU!e as he has been well except for mild osteo-\narthritis of the knee. On psychosocial history, he reports \nthat he has not felt down, depressed, or hopeless during \nthe past month nor has he been bothered by a lack of Inter-\nest in activities. He denies any changes at home and has \nno trouble of7talnlng food. He has never used tobacco and \ndrinks 2 beers a1:7out once a mont h. \nOn revieof systems. there are no f evers, night sweat s, \nswollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, headaches, shortness \nof breath, cough, heat Intolerance, palpitations or t remu-\nlousness. There are also no GJ symptoms of oral pain, dys-\nphagia, odynophagia, melena, hematochezla, abdominal pain, \nor jaundice. \nHis medications include 600 mg of ibuprofen 2-3 times \na day for mild osteoarthritis of his le~ knee. Physical exam \nreveals a thin but otherwise healthy appearing middle-aged \nman. Vita[ sl!:jns are normal. The remainder of his exam Is \ncompletely nonnal. \nLaboratory tests, Including CBC with different ial, \nhepatic panel, renal panel, urinalysis, CRP, ESR, and TSH, are \nnormal. HIV and FOBT are negative. A chest radlograph Is \nnormal without mass or adenopathy. \nThe cause of Mr. O's weight loss is not immediately obvious. \nHowever, his early satiety and NSAID use are clues that suggest \npeptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastritis, or gastric cancer. You con-\nsider PUD your leading hypothesis. Gastric cancer is an alternative \nhypothesis, and colon cancer is a must not miss hypothesis given his \nchange in bowel habits. Table 32-4 lists the differential diagnosis. \nAll medications (prescription, over-the-counter \nand traditional/herbal) should be carefully \nscrutinized in patients complaining of unin-\ntentional weight loss. Some medications cause \nanorexia directly by suppressing appetite, while \nothers act through various organ toxicities. \n\n572 I CHAPTER 32 \nTable32-4.

If not, what other lnfonnatlon do \nyou need7 \nLeading Hypothesis: PUD \nTextbook Presentation \nThe pain of PUD is classically described as a dull or hunger-like \npain in the epigastrium that is either exacerbated or improved by \nfood intake. The pain is often worse on waking and may radiate to \nthe back. Symptomatic periods often last for several weeks. Nausea \nand early satiety may be seen. \nDisease Higblighta \nA. 250,000 cases per year in the United States \nB. Etiology: In the United States, most ulcers are secondary to \nNSAID use, Helicobacter pylori infection or both. The preva-\nlence of H pylori varies widdy depending on the region. \n1. H pylori infection \na. Present in 50% of the world's population \nb. Asymptomatic in the majority of patients \nc. Peptic ulcers (in the stomach or duodenum) develop in \n1-10% ofinfected patients. \nd. H pylori may also cause atrophic gastritis, intestinal \nmetaplasia, and rarely, gastric cancer (0.1-3% of \ninfected patients). \n2. NSAIDs \na. Virtually all NSAIDs increase the risk of PUD, including \nover-the-counter NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin. The risk \nis lower with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors. \nb. Ulcer disease develops in 25% of persons who take \nNSAIDs regularly. \nc. PUD-related bleeding or perforation is present in 2-4% \nof persons who take NSAIDs regularly. \nd. Results in 100,000 NSAID-associated hospitalizations \nin the United States annually, with 7000-10,000 deaths. \ne. Gastric ulcers are 5 times more common than duodenal \nulcers. \nf. Ulcers are most likely to occur in the first 1-3 months \nofNSAID use. \ng. Risk factors for NSAID-associated PUD include the \nfollowing: \n(1) History of prior PUD \n(2) Age > 65 years \n(3) High-dose NSAID therapy \n(4) Concomitant use of aspirin (loor high dose), \ncorticosteroids, or anticoagulants. \n(5) Concurrent H pylori infection \nh. NSAIDs may be nonselective, inhibiting both COX-1 \nand COX-2, or selective, inhibiting only COX-2. \n(1) Selective COX-2 inhibitors have less GI toxicity. \n(2) However, several selective COX-2 inhibitors increase \nthe risk of myocardial infarction and several have \nbeen withdrawn from the market. Celecoxib is still \navailable. \n(3) Alternate strategies to decrease the risk of NSAID-\nrelated PUD include concurrent use of proton \npump inhibitors (PPis) or misoprostol. \n3. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a rare cause of PUD \nthat results from a tumor secreting gastrin, leading to \nhypersecretion ofHCL in the stomach. \nC. Complications \nI. Bleeding, which can vary from massive hemorrhage \n(with hematemesis and melena or hematochezia) to occult, \nchronic, subtle bleeding with iron deficiency anemia \n(see Chapter 19, GI Bleeding}. \n2. Perforation \n3. Weight loss \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. History and physical exam \nI. Pain is not a good predictor of PUD. \na. Ulcers are often asymptomatic and symptoms are more \nlikely with non-NSAID-associated ulcers. \n(l) 60% ofNSAID-associated ulcers are asymptomatic. \n(2) 25% of non-NSAID ulcers are asymptomatic. \nb. Pain often reflects nonulcer dyspepsia rather than PUD. \n(1) Less than one-third of patients with epigastric \ndiscomfort have PUD. \n(2) Among patients undergoing endoscopy, patients \nwith nonulcer dyspepsia have more severe and \nnumerous symptoms than patients with PUD. \nc. Surprisingly, several clinical predictors are not good \nat discriminating ulcer from nonulcer dyspepsia \nincluding: \n(1) Response to antisecretory therapy \n(2) Epigastric tenderness \n(3) The quality of the pain \n2. Best predictors of PUD are a history of NSAID use and \nH py/qri infection (Table 32-5). \n\nTable 32-5. Prevalence of PUD in patients with dyspepsia. \nAge \nNeither H-11cobacteT \npylori nor NSAIDs \nCurrent \nNSAIDuse \nHpylori \nlnfedian \n40 years \n1 % \n5% \n20% \n----------------------------------------------------- \n75 years \n3% \n20% \n30% \nNSAID, nonsteroldal anti-Inflammatory drug; PUD, peptic ulcer disease. \nWhen considering PUD, it is critical to ask \nthe patient about NSAID use, including both \nover-the-counter and prescription analgesics, \nas well as low-dose aspirin. \n3. The first sign of PUD may be a life-threatening \ncomplication (hemorrhage or perforation}: > 50% of \npatients with serious to life-threatening complication had \nno prior symptom. \n4. Unintentional weight loss may be a sign of a benign gastric \nulcer. \na. 31-55% of patients with benign gastric ulcer noted \nweight loss. \nb. ~50% lost 10-20 lbs; 21% lost> 20 lb \nc. PUD is found more often in patients undergoing \nesophagogascroduodenoscopy (EGD) for weight loss \nthan for dyspepsia. \nA significant number of patients with \nNSAID-induced ulcers do not experience pain. \nAnemia, GI bleeding, early satiety, or weight \nloss can be the only symptom of PUD. \nB. Laboratory studies \n1. H pylori testing \na. Eradication markedly decreases recurrence of PUD from \n60-100% to< 20%. All patients with documented \nPUD, whether or not they are taking NSAIDs, should \nbe tested for H pylori. \nb. Patients with a prior history of PUD who have not \npreviously been treated for H pylori should also be \ntested. \nc. Testing for H pylori is also recommended for patients \nwith dyspepsia. Eradication is recommended in all \ninfected patients. \nd. Options for diagnosing H pylori infection include \ninvasive and noninvasive testing. \n(1) Noninvasive \n(a) Urea breath tests and H pylori stool antigen are \npreferred in patients not undergoing EGD. \n(b) The stool antigen test is much more widely \navailable than the urea breath test and is used \nmuch more commonly in practice. \n(c) Serology cannot distinguish prior to current \ninfection and is not recommended in most \ncases. \n(2) Invasive \n(a) Rapid urease test and biopsy with microscopic \nexamination are preferred in patients undergoing \nEGD, although this is not commonly indicated \nas a first step in patients < 60 years. \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 573 \nTable 32-6.

Patients with bleeding and negative \nrapid urease tests and negative histology should \nundergo urea breath tests several weeks after \ncompleting PPI therapy. \n(3) Test characteristics are shown in Table 32-6. \n2. Ulcer diagnosis \na. EGD is more sensitive than upper GI series (92% vs \n54%) and is useful to rule out other serious pathology. \nb. Recent guidelines stratify the approach to EGD by \npatient age \n(1) EGD is recommended in patients aged 60 years or \nolder with dyspepsia to rule out serious conditions, \nincluding cancer. \n(2) EGD is not usually recommended in patients \nyounger than 60 years with dyspepsia. \n(a) EGD can usually be deferred in favor of \nnoninvasive H pylori testing and presumptive \nPPI therapy. \n(b) This includes patients younger than 60 years \nwith \"alarm features\" (anemia, weight loss, \ndysphagia or persistent vomiting). \ni. Alarm features have relatively poor overall \noperating characteristics for the presence \nof organic pathology {gastritis, PUD, or \nneoplasia). \nii. LR+ of2.74 \niii. Coupled with the very loprevalence of \ngastric cancer in patients younger than 60 years \n(without a family history or personal risk \nfuctor placing them at higher risk), endoscopy \nis unlikely to be a cost-effective strategy. \n(c) EGD should be considered in patients younger \nthan 60 years with weight loss ~ 20 pounds, \nrapidly progressive dysphagia, or a combination \nof alarm features. \n(d) This guideline does not apply when alarm \nsymptoms are present in the absence of \ndyspepsia; in this case, alarm symptoms should \nbe pursued more aggressively. \n(3) A diagnostic approach to dyspepsia is illustrated in \nFigure 32-3. \n\n574 I CHAPTER 32 \nDyspepsia \nPositive \nTreat H pylori -------< \nNo \n<? 60years \nNo \nEGO and \nAbdominal ultrasound \nConsider TCA, proklnetlc therapy \nEGO, esophagogastroduodenoscopy; PPI, proton pump inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic antidepressant. \n1 EGD should be considered in patients < 60 years with weight loss :! 20 pounds, rapidly progressive \ndysphagia, or a combination of alarm features. \n2See text for recommendations. \nFigure 32-3. Diagnostic approach: dyspepsia. \nTreatment \nA. The 3 components of therapy for PUD include eradication \nof H pylori, if present; discontinuation ofNSAIDs, if possible; \nand use of PPis. In addition, gastric ulcers warrant biopsy to \nrule out malignancy. \nB. Regardless of the cause of the ulcer, and the presence or \nabsence of bleeding. PPis dramatically suppress acid secretion \nand are the mainstay of therapy. For patients infected with \nH pylori, PPis are given during the course of antibiotic \ntherapy, longer for larger ulcers(> 1-2 cm) and in patients \nwith complications or persistent symptoms. \nC. H pylori eradication \nI. Multiple options: Ideal initial therapy is controversial and \nrecommendations are likely to evolve due to changing \nresistance patterns. \n2. Conflrming eradication \na. Increased incidence of H pylori resistance has led to the \nrecommendation for posttreatment testing to confirm \neradication in patients with documented PUD or those \nwith recurrent dyspepsia. \nb. Appropriate tests include the stool antigen or urea \nbreath tests. Testing should be delayed until 4-6 weeks \nafter completing therapy because both PPis and \nantibiotics can cause false-negative test. \nD. NSAID-associated ulcers \n1. Prevention \na. A variety of options are available to reduce the risk \nofNSAID-associated PUD, including minimizing \nthe NSAID dose; avoiding concomitant aspirin, \ncorticosteroids, and oral anticoagulants when possible; \nusing COX-2 selective inhibitors in patients without \ncardiovascular risk; and adding gastric protection with \nPPis or misoprostol. \nb. PPis \n(1) Very effective \n(2) Reduce the ulceration rate in high-risk patients (those \nover 65 years or with prior ulcers) from 17% to 5% \nas well as the rat.e of GI bleeding (relative risk 0.13). \nc. Misoprostol \n(1) Similar efficacy to PPis \n(2) Requires dosing 4 times daily and is frequently \nassociated with diarrhca, limiting its usefulness. \nd. H2 reccptor antagonists arc less effective than PPis. \ne. COX-2 inhibitors \n(1) Reduce the rate of ulcers compared with nonsclcctivc \nNSAIDs (relative risk 0.26) but appear less effective \nthan PPis (when combined with nonsdective NSAIDs}. \n(2) Increase the risk of cardiovascular events \n\n(3) The gastric protection of COX-2 inhibitors is \neliminated in patients on concurrent low-dose aspirin. \n Ineffective strategies for preventing NSAID-associated \ngastric ulcers include sucralfate and enteric-coated aspirin. \ng. Patients with recent PUD-rdated bleeding \n(1) Continuing NSAIDs (nonselective with a PPI or \nCOX-2 selective) results in high complication rates. \n(2) The combined use of PPis with COX-2 inhibitors \nwas safe in patients with documented ulcer bleeding \nwho did not have H pylori infection. \nh. Current guidelines for ulcer prevention: \n(1) All patients: If prior PUD, test and eradicate H pylori. \n(2) Use lowest dose of NSAID possible for the briefest \nperiod. \n(3) Prophylactic therapy is stratified based on the \npatient's risk factors for PUD \n(a) Risk factors include age > 65; high-dose \nNSAID therapy; prior history of uncomplicated \nPUD; concomitant aspirin, corticosteroids, or \nanticoagulants \n(b) PPis or misoprostol are recommended for \npatients with 1-2 risk factors \n(c) For patients with > 2 risk factors or recent or \ncomplicated PUD: \ni. Requiring low-dose aspirin (for CAD or \nCVD): Avoid all other NSAIDs (including \nCOX-2 inhibitors) and use PPI or misoprostol. \nii. Not requiring lodose aspirin: Avoid \nNSAIDs if possible or alternatively use \nCOX-2 inhibitor with PPI or misoprostol. \n2. Documented ulcers \na. Test for H pylori infection and eradicate if present. \nb. Discontinue NSAIDs if possible, initiate PPI therapy. \nc. Strategies for patients who require continuation of \nNSAIDs (even low-dose aspirin) should include: \n(1) Continue PPI therapy for the duration ofNSAID \n(even after H pylori eradication). \n(2) Minimize the dose and duration ofNSAIDs. \n(3) Avoid certain high-risk nonselective NSAIDs, such \nas ketorolac, piroxicam, indomethacin, diclofenac, \nsulindac, and naproxen, all of which increase the \nrelative risk of PUD. \nE. Follow-up endoscopy \n1. Many authorities recommend posttreatrnent follow-up \nendoscopy for patients with documented gastric ulcers \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. A. is a 62-year-old man who complains of recent weight \nloss. He reports that he has lost 1 5 pounds over the last \n6- 9 months, and that his clothes no longer fit. He does \nnot have dlarrhea but does have abdominal bloating and Is \nhaving several large stools a c:lay that are difficult to flush. \nHe reports that his appetite Is not what It used to 1'e but \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 575 \nto rule out an underlying gastric cancer missed on initial \nendoscopy. \n2. This will have the greatest yield in high-risk groups (Asians, \nHispanics, patients over 55 years, and those with a history \nof H pylori infection without recent NSAID use). \n3. Follow-up endoscopy is particularly important in patients \nwith gastric ulcers in whom adequate biopsies were not \nobtained during the initial endoscopy. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nGiven the absence of pain, Mr. O's history ofNSAID use, the early \nsatiety, and weight loss convince you to order an EGD. \n\nThe EGD reveals 2 gastric ulcers 1.5 cm in size. Pathology \nreveals organisms consistent with H fYlori. \n~ \nHayou croesed a diagnostic threshold for \n1~Jll\"\"' the leading hyPOthesls, gastric ulcer1 Have \nyou ruled out the active alternatlwe1 Do \nother tests need to be done to exclude the \nalternative dlagno5H1 \nYou conclude that the likely cause of Mr. O's weight loss is \ngastric ulcer. You elect to initiate therapy without further testing. \nAltogether, malignant and nonmalignant GI \ndiseases are the cause of unintentional weight \nloss in 28% of patients. The yield ofEGD \nin patients with unintentional weight loss is \n12-44%. EGD should be considered in the \nevaluation of patients with unexplained weight \nloss especially in the absence of epigastric pain \n(which is counterintuitive). \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMr. 0 received eradication t herapy, a PP!, and stopped the \nibuprofen. Three months later, his appetite is excellent and \nhis weight Is approaching baseline. He is advised to use \nacetaminophen for his arthritis pain and to perform nonim-\npact physlcal act lvltles. \nattributes that to his recent separation from his wife. He \nconfides that they have not gotten along for years. She \nseemed to blame everything on his drinking, but he assures \nyou that alcohol was definitely not a problem. \n~ \nAt thle polnt, what le the leading hypotheele, \n1~Jll\"' what ans the active alternatives, and Is \nthere a must not mf99 dlagnoel91 Given this \ndifferential diagnoeie, what teete ehould be \nordered1 \n\n576 I CHAPTER 32 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe first pivotal step in evaluating Mr. Ifs unintentional weight \nloss is to verify the weight loss. This is dearly established by his \nhistory and a revieof his medical records. The second step looks \nfor symptoms suggestive of malabsorption and although he denies \nfrank diarrhea, his large frequent stools raise the possibility of \nGI diseases associated with malabsorption. The: third pivotal \nstep differentiates weight loss due to decreased caloric intake or \nabsorption from that due to increased caloric expenditure and \nthe fourth (and pivotal) step reviews the history, physical exam, \nand laboratory studies to look for other dues that might suggest \na diagnosis. Mr. Ns social history raises several possibilities. First, \nyou suspect that his drinking is a problem and might be contrib-\nuting to his weight loss. Alternatively, he may be more depressed \nthan he acknowledges or simply adjusting to lifestyle changes \nprecipitated by his separation. His difficult to flush stools also \nsuggests one of a variety of causes of malabsorption. Table 32-7 \nlists the differential diagnosis. \n\nOn further 'l,Uestionlr19, Mr. A reports that he drinks \"two \nor so\" alcoholic beverages a night. He proudly states that \nhe has never missed work due to a hangover and never \ndrinks before noon. When you ask him homuch alcohol he \nuses when preparing each drink and whether anyone else \nhas commented on his drinking. he gets defensive and \nreminds you he Is here because he Is losing weight. \n~ \nle the clinical Information eufflclent to make a \n1~JI\"\" diagnosis? If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nMr. Ifs defensiveness increases your suspicion of an alcohol use: \ndisorder. You wonder homuch alcohol consumption is normal, \nwhat would constitute problem drinking, and hoto evaluate him \nmore thoroughly for alcohol use disorder. \nLeading Hypothesis: Alcohol Use Disorder \nTextbook Presentation \nAlcohol intake varies from low-risk use to risky use, problem drink-\ning, abuse, and finally alcohol dependence. Patients with alcohol \nuse disorders present along a continuum, from the functioning \nexecutive to the homeless alcoholic. Psychosocial complications \ninclude job loss, marital difficulties, loss of driving license, and vio-\nlent behavior. Medical complications may include accidental injury, \npancreatitis, gastritis, cirrhosis, vitamin deficiency, cardiomyop-\nathy, hypertension, malnutrition, weight loss, and death. Weight \nloss may be multifactorial secondary to decreased caloric intake \nduring intoxication or due: to alcohol-related illnesses (gastritis, \npancreatitis, cirrhosis}. Alcohol use disorders may be difficult to \nrecognize early, when intervention may prevent progression. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Alcohol is responsible for 79,000 deaths per year in the United \nStates and alcohol misuse disorders affect 9% of the US popu-\nlation. Causes of alcohol-related deaths include motor vehicle \naccidents, drownings, suicides, cirrhosis, and an increased risk \nof several cancers (esophageal, breast, pharyngeal, laryngeal, \nand hepatocellular cancer). \nB. Women are more likely to deny alcohol-related problems and \nto have associated eating disorders, depression, and panic \ndisorders. \nTable 32-7.

Categories and definitions of patterns of alcohol use (1 drink \nis defined as 12 g of alcohol or 1.5 oz ofliquor, 5 oz of wine, \nor 12 oz of beer) \n1. Risky use: Prevalence 4-29%. Criteria: \na. Men s 65 years:> 14 drinks/wk or> 4 drinks per \noccasion \n\nb. Women of any age and men > 65 years: > 7 drinks/wk \nor > 3 drinks per occasion \n2. Hazardous drinking: At risk for consequences from \nalcohol \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The USPSTF recommends screening all adults for alcohol \nmisuse annually. \n1. The 3 recommended screening tools are the 10 question \nAudit tool, the 3 question Audit-C tool (found at http:// \nwww.integration.sarnhsa.gov/ clinical-practicc/screening-\ntools#drugs) or a single question \"Homany times in the \npast year have you had 5 or more drinks per day (for men} \nor 4 (for women and persons over 65 years}. \n2. An Audit score ofa 4 in men (~ 3 in women) has a \nsensitivity of 84-85%, specificity of 77-84%; LR+, 4.2; \nLR-, 0.2. \n3. A single positive response to the 1 question tool has a \nsensitivity of 82 %, specificity of 79% for unhealthy use; \nLR+, 3.9; LR-, 0.23. \nB. The DSM-5 defines alcohol use disorder as \"a problematic pat-\ntern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment \nor distress, as manifested by at least two of the following\" over \na I-year period: \n1. Alcohol often consumed in larger amounts or over a longer \nperiod than was intended. \n2. Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or \ncontrol alcohol use. \n3. A great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering \nfrom alcohol. \n4. Craving, or strong desire to use alcohol. \n5. Recurrent use resulting in failure to fulfil! major role or \nobligations. \n6. Continued use despite social or interpersonal problems \ncaused by or exacerbated by alcohol. \n7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are \ngiven up or reduced because of alcohol use. \n8. Continued use despite knowledge of a phyi;ical or \npsychological problem caused by or exacerbated by alcohol. \n9. Tolerance \n10. Withdrawal \nC. A variety of clinical clues can suggest alcohol misuse, \nincluding injury; resistant hypertension; family, work, \nor legal problems; violence; depression; substance abuse; \nchronic pain; anemia; thrombocytopenia; or a family \nhistory of alcoholism. \nD. Laboratory abnormalities (Table 32-8) \n1. A variety oflaboratory abnormalities may be seen in \npatients with heavy alcohol use, including an devated \nAST, GGT, or macrocytosis. \nTable 32-8. Accuracy of detecting unhealthy drinking \nusing laboratory tests. \nSensitivity \nSpac:tfldty \nLR+ \nLR-\nIncreased GGT \n65% \n80% \n3.3 \n0.44 \nMacrocytosis \n24% \n6 \n0.79 \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 577 \n2. Elevated levels may increase the suspicion of alcoholism \nbut are insensitive and should not be used to rule out \nthe diagnosis. That is, patients with alcohol use disorder \nmay (and frequently do) have normal liver enzymes and \ncomplete blood counts. \n3. The sensitivity increases in patients with alcohol \ndependency in whom the diagnosis is increasingly \nobvious. \nE. Patients in whom risky drinking is suspected should be \nasked about symptoms that suggest the alcohol use disorder, \nhealth problems related to alcohol use (gastritis, pancreatitis, \nalcoholic liver disease [including alcoholic hepatitis and cir-\nrhosis], and resistant hypertension), readiness to change, and \ntheir pattern of consumption (including average number of \ndrinks per day, maximum number of drinks per day, and dayi; \nper week that they consume alcohol). \nTreatment \nA. Brief (6-15 minute) multi-contact counseling interventions \nfor persons identified with risky or hazardous drinking has \nbeen demonstrated to reduce weekly consumption, heavy \ndrinking, traumatic injury, and death and is recommended \nby the USPSTF. \nB. Components of effective interventions for hazardous drinkers \ninclude: \nI. Specialty referral \n2. Feedback on clinical and laboratory assessment \n3. Comparison to drinking norms \n4. Discussion of the adverse effects of alcohol \n5. Statement of the recommended drinking limits \n6. Prescription to \"Cut down on your drinking\" \n7. Patient educational material (www.niaaa.nih.gov) \n8. Drinking diary \n9. Follow-up office sessions and phone contact \nC. Patients at moderate to high risk for alcohol withdrawal \n(a potentially fatal condition} and those with concomitant \npsychiatric disorders (especially suicidal ideation) or unstable \nhome environments should be hospitalized in a detoxification \nunit. (See Chapter 11, Alcohol Withdrawal.) \nD. Patients with alcohol use disorder should also receive a referral \nto a specialty treatment center, pharmacotherapy, and suppon \ngroups. \nE. Rdapse prevention: Several options \n1. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a 12-step program that \nhas demonstrated effectiveness in increasing the rate of \nabstinence at 3 years from 43% to 62% \n2. Motivational enhancement therapy \n3. Therapy to develop cognitive-behavioral coping skills \n4. Naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram have reduced \ndrinking in patients with alcohol dependence. \nPharmacotherapy is most effective when combined with \nbehavioral suppon. \n5. Treatment of depression and other mental illness, if present. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. Xs history of\"two or so\" drinks per night suggest at-risk drink-\ning. Furthermore, his marital separation, while possibly multifac-\ntorial, raises the possibility of alcohol abuse that is interfering with \n\n578 I CHAPTER 32 \nhis relationships. You ask Mr. A the screening question if he has \nhad 5 or more drinks on any day in the last year. \n\nMr. A reports that he probably c:irinks that much at least \nonce a month when he Is \"partying.\" \nMr. A.'s response increases your concern. You elect to adminis-\nter the Audit score questionnaire. \n\nMr. A scores 15 (out of a possible 40). He acknowlec:iges \nthat he triec:i to cut c:iown while he was married, but \nsince his separation, he no longer feels that restraint. \nHe acknowledges that occasionally he hears funny sto-\nries about himself from these parties that he cannot \nrecollect (amnesia). Mr. A also reluctantly reports that \nhe received 2 citations for driving while lntoxlcatec:i \nwithin the past year. He feels mildly guilty about this but \nassures you he knows better than to make that mistake \nagain. He reiterates that he has never missed work due to \nhis drinking butdlc:i miss several family events because he \nwas \"partying.\" \nMr. Ks Audit score, marital difficulties, black.outs, tickets for \ndriving while intoxicated, missed social events, and continued use \ndespite interpersonal difficulties is diagnostic of an alcohol use dis-\norder. You elect to check a CBC and a liver panel. \nThe CBC shows macrocytosls anc:i the liver panel shows a \nmllc:ily elevated AST and ALT. The elevation In AST Is more \nmarked than the elevation in ALT. a pattern commonly seen \nin alcoholic liver disease. \nClearly, Mr. A suffers from alcohol abuse. This may be the sole \ncause or a contributing cause of his unintentional weight loss. You \nelect to initiate a treatment plan and reevaluate him once he is \nabstinent. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nYou have a frank discussion of the issues with Mr. A. You \nacknowledge 'that his mari'tal dlfftcul'tles are complex but \n'that many fea'tures of his alcohol use sugges't an alcohol \nuse disorder. The mlssec:i family gatherings, alcoholic black-\nouts, tolerance, tickets for c:iriving while intoxicated, anc:i \nabnormal blood test results all suggest this Is a serious \nmedical problem. Mr. A confides that he is frightened to go \n\"cold 'turkey.\" because he feels shaky and agitated whenever \nhe stops drinking. You suggest ac:imlsslon to a detoxifica-\ntion unit. Mr. A llstens carefully and agrees to be admitted \nto the detoxification unit. \nFOLLOW-UP OF MR. A \nTwo months later, Mr. A returns to your office. His mood is \nclearly better. He prouc:ily reports that he is \"on t he wagon\" \nand feeling better. He attends M meetings 5-7 nlgh'ts per \nweek. However; he remains concerned about his weight. He \nreports that his appetite Is better and he Is eating well but \nhas not regained any weight. \nAt thle point, what le the leading hypotheele, \nwhat are the actlve altematlves, and is \nthere a must not mise diagnoeie? Given this \ndlfferentlal dlag noele, what teete ehould be \nordered? \nMr. Ks response to your intervention is rewarding. It is surpris-\ning that his weight is not improving, particularly in light of his \nimproved appetite. During his previous visit, he mentioned dif-\nficult to flush, large stools and you wonder if part of his weight \nloss is secondary to malabsorption. He continues to have these \nlarge, difficult to flush stools. You revisit the common causes of \nmalabsorption (Table 32-9 and Figure 32-4). \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nMr. Ks history of difficult to flush stools but no diarrhea is more \nsuggestive of chronic malabsorption than a chronic infectious diar-\nrhea. You reviethose causes carefully and consider chronic small \nbowd disease {eg, inflammatory bowd disease [IBD], bacterial \novergrowth, celiac disease) and chronic pancreatitis. \nMr. A has never been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. \nHe does remember multiple episodes of abdominal pain \nover the years following a nlgh't of binging. He did not seek \nmedical care but remained at home c:irlnklng only clear \nfluids for several days unt il the pain subsided. He denies \nany history of bowel surgery, family history of IBD, or \nhematochezia. \nMr. Ks history of alcohol abuse and recurrent pain leads you to \nsuspect that he may have chronic pancreatitis. This becomes the \nleading hypothesis. \n~~ Is the cllnlcal Information sufficient to make a \n1~Jll\"\" dlagnoele? If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Chronic Pancreatitis \nTextbook Presentation \nPatients typically seek medical attention for long-standing post-\nprandial abdominal pain. Frequent, loose, malodorous bowel \nmovements are common, and weight loss occurs. Patients may \nnote that several flushes are required to clear the toilet. A prior \nhistory of alcoholism and acute pancreatitis are clues to the \ndiagnosis. \n\nTable 32-9.

Usually secondary to recurrent acute pancreatitis, primarily \nfrom alcohol abuse (70% of adult cases). Less common causes \nin adults include cystic fibrosis, hereditary pancreatitis, ductal \nobstruction (ie, stones, tumor), tobacco use, autoimmune dis-\nease, hypercalcemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. \nB. Progressive pancreatic destruction results in both exocrine and \nendocrine insufficiency. \nC. Manifestations include \n1. Chronic, disabling, mid-epigastric postprandial pain is \nvery common (80-100% of patients) and a major cause \nof morbidity. The pain may radiate to the back and be \nrdieved by sitting forward. \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 579 \n2. Weight loss secondary to anorexia and malabsorption with \nsteatorrhea \n3. Steatorrhea \na. Defined as fat malabsorption ~ 14 g/day (nl S 7 g/day \nfccal fat on 75-100 g fat diet. Patients with primarily \nwatery diarrhea may excrete up to 13 g/day of \nfccal fat). \nb. Manifestations include difficult to flush oily stools and \nweight loss. Elderly patients may not have diarrhea. \nc. Floating stools are not specific for steatorrhea. Bacterial \ngas may also cause stools to float. \nd. Diarrhea may develop secondary to bacterial \novcrgrowm, which develops in 40% of patients with \nchronic pancreatitis. \n4. Diabetes may devdop due to the concomitant destruction \nof islet cells. \na. Ketoacidosis is rare. \nb. Hypoglycemia is common due to loss of glucagon-\nproducing pancreatic alpha cells. \n5. Complications include pseudocysts, necrosis, obstruction of \nthe common bile duct or duodenum, and pancreatic ascites \n(usually from a ductal disruption). Splenic vein thrombosis \nmay also devdop, leading to gastric varices. \n6. Pancreatic cancer develops in 4% of patients but no \nconsensus on screening. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. One study reported unintentional weight loss and diarrhea in \n68%, and bloating in 30%. Diabetes was found in 28%. \nB. Laboratory tests \n1. Manifestations may be structural (pancreatic calcifi.cations, \natrophy, and ductal dilatation) or functional (with \npancreatic insufficiency). \n2. While patients with advanced disease typically have both \nstructural and functional changes, patients with early \ndisease may have either just structural changes (diagnosed \non imaging) or just functional abnormalities (diagnosed \nwith secretin testing). \n3. The gold standard is biopsy, which is rarely performed. \n4. Precise sensitivity and specificity are difficult to estimate \ndue to the (1) infrequency of biopsy, (2) difficulty \ninterpreting results in patients with discordant structural \nand functional changes, and (3) variation of sensitivity and \nspecificity with stage of the disease. \n5. Structural changes are typically diagnosed with CT scan, \nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancrcatography (ERCP), \nendoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), or magnetic resonance \ncholangiopancreatography (MRCP). \n6. CT scan with contrast \na. Often performed first given availability, although \nMRCP, EUS, and ERCP have similar operating \ncharacteristics. \nb. CT manifestations include ductal calcifications \n(74-90% sensitive, 85% specific), ductal dilatations, \nand pancreatic atrophy. Pancreatic fluid collections, \nnecrosis, or mmors can also be seen. \nc. Pancreatic calcifications are often assumed to be specific \nfor chronic pancrcatitis but have also been reported in a \nvariety of pancreatic tumors. \n\n580 I CHAPTER 32 \nHistory \nDietary history: Association with milk products, sorbitol-containing mints or gums, caffeine, ruffage \nMedcation history: Including over-the-counter medications, antacids, recent antibiotics, metformin \nSocial history: Recent travel, alcohol use, risk factors for HIV \nFamily history: Jewish descent, family history of IBD or ceiiac disease \nClinical clues: Weight loss, stool appearance (bloody, oily), history of pancreatitis, alcohol use, \nmanifestations of IBD (hematochezia, erythema nodosum, uveltis, aphthous ulcers, rectal abscess, fever); \nPast medical history: Prior small bowel or gastric resection, cholecystectomy, radiation \nPhyalcal eu.m: Include comprehensive exam, weight, thyroid and abdominal exam, FOBT.

Diagnostic approach: malabsorption and diarrhea. \n7. ERCP is invasive and typically reserved for patients in \nwhom it might be therapeutic (ie, stenting) (sensitivity, \n75- 95%; specificity\"' 90%). \n8. Secreting stimulation functional assessment \na. Typically the most sensitive tests in chronic pancreatitis \nwith excellent negative predictive value. \nb. Time consuming, labor intensive, invasive, and not \nwidely available \nc. Sccretin is administered and the pancreatic secretions \ncollected in the duodenum. Peak bicarbonate \nconcentration is measured. \nd. Cholecystokinin stimulation of the acini (to produce \nlipase) has also been used. \n\ne. Greatest utility may be in patients with early chronic \npancreatitis in whom imaging studies may be normal. \n9. EUS: Using secretin as gold standard, 71 % sensitive, 92% \nspecific; LR+, 7.9; LR-, 0.32 \n10. Other less diagnostic tests \na. Amylase and lipase are often normal or slightly elevated. \nb. Abdominal radiographs may reveal pancreatic \ncalcifications. Sensitivity is only 30%. \nc. Routine abdominal ultrasound is 60-70% sensitive and \n80-90% specific. \nll. MRCP with secretin (used to enhance visualization of the \npancreatic ducts) is being evaluated for the diagnosis of \nchronic pancreatitis. \n12. Fecal elastase may be low(< 200mcg/g) in patients with \nchronic pancreatitis, but false-positives and false-negatives \nexist. Pooled sensitivity 77%, specificity 88% (LR+, 6.4; \nLR-, 0.26) when compared to secretin testing. In patients \nwith lorisk for exocrine insufficiency, normal value rules \nout pancreatic exocrine insufficiency; in patients at higher \nrisk, false-negative rate may be as high as 10%. \nTreatment \nA. Abstinence from tobacco and drinking alcohol is vital (but not \nuniversally effective at halting progression). \nB. Pain management \n1. Exclude other causes of increasing or persistent pain \n2. NSAIDs, TCAs, and opioids are often used. Opioid \ndependence is a common problem. \nC. Pancreatic enzymes \nl. Can decrease pain and improve nutritional status. \n2. Give with meals and low-fat diets(< 20 g/day). \n3. Nonenteric-coated enzymes may provide superior pain \nrelief. \n4. Coadministration of PPis is recommended to prevent the \ninactivation of the enzymes. \nD. Patients with diabetes are at risk for hypoglycemia with therapy \n(due to concomitant loss of glucagon production. Diabetes \nshould be treated cautiously and metformin should be avoided \nin patients with alcohol use disorder. \nE. ERCP with scenting, and surgery are useful in selected patients \nto relieve obstruction and pain. \nF. Treatment of peripancreatic fluid collections and pancreatic \nnecrosis require specialty consultation and often require \nendoscopic drainage. \nG. Total pancreatecromy with auto-islet transplantation \nmay be considered in specialty centers for younger \npatients with chronic pancreatitis and severe functional \nlimitation. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nA CT scan with contrast of the abdomen reveals multiple \nareas of pancreatic calciftcations consistent with chronic \npancreatitis. Fecal elastase is 84 mcg/g, suggestive of \npancreatic insufficiency. \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 581 \nHave you crossed a diagnostic threshold for \nthe lading hYPothHle, chronic pancreatltls1 \nHave you ruled out the active altematlve&1 \nDo other teete need to be done to SJ<Clude the \naltemative dlagnoeee1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Bacterial Overgrowth \nTextbook Presentation \nClassically, patients have previously undergone GI surgery that \nresulted in some type of surgical blind loop that allows for bacterial \nmultiplication. Patients may experience long-standing diarrhea, \nbloating, and weight loss. \nDiseue Highlights \nA. Mechanism of diarrhea is multifactorial. \nl. Bacteria digest carbohydrates producing gas and osmotically \nactive byproducts promoting an osmotic diarrhea. \n2. Bacteria and their fatty acid byproducts injure mucosa and \ncontribute to diarrhea. \n3. Mucosal injury can lead to lactase deficiency. \n4. Bacterial deconjugation of bile salts interferes with fat \nabsorption as well as the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. \nB. Etiologies \nl. Stasis \na. Strictures (surgical, Crohn disease, radiation enteritis) \nb. Anatomic abnormalities (surgical blind loops or diverticula) \nc. Dysmotility (diabetic autonomic neuropathy, scleroderma, \nopioid use) \nd. Chronic pancreatitis (obstruction or opioid therapy can \npromote stasis). \n2. Abnormal small to large intestine connections (ie, fistula) or \nresection of ileocecal valve (allows retrograde colonization \nfrom heavily colonized colon into ileum) \n3. Achlorhydria (ie, PPI therapy or autoimmune) \n4. Miscellaneous (pancreatic insufficiency, cirrhosis up to \n60% of patients, end-stage renal disease) \nC. Bacteria may utilize B12, leading to B12 deficiency. \nD. Unusual complications include tetany (due to hypocalcemia) \nand night blindness due to vitamin A deficiency. \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Healthy older patients may also have bacterial overgrowth \nwithout any symptoms, making diagnosis difficult. \nB. Gold standard is quantitative jejunal aspirates demonstrating \n> 105 bacteria/mL. \nC. A variety of tests detect bacterial byproducts in exhaled breath \nas an aid to diagnosis. Since bacteria normally reside in the \ncolon, but only in lolevels in the small intestine, early peaks \nin the concentration of these byproducts suggest small intes-\ntinal bacterial overgrowth. False-positives and false-negatives \noccur when other conditions increase or decrease bowel transit \ntime, respectively. Antibiotics can interfere with the breath tests. \n1. D xylose breath test is usually abnormal secondary to \nbacterial digestion of xylose-releasing radiolabeled C 14. \na. Sensitivity, 30-95%; specificity, 89-100%. \nb. Avoid in fertile women. \n\n582 I CHAPTER 32 \n2. Hydrogen breath tests measure exhaled bacterial hydrogen \nproduction after patients ingest sugar. \na. Their accuracy is similar to the xylose tests and avoids \nradioactivity. \nb. Some bacteria produce methane, and this measurement \nmay increase accuracy. \nD. Consider bacterial overgrowth if upper GI series demonstrates \nhypomotility, obstruction, or diverticula. \nE. Weight loss may occur withour diarrhea. \nF. Therapeutic trials of antibiotics may be necessary. \nTreatment \nA. Eliminate drugs that reduce intestinal motility (especially \nopioids) or reduce gastric acidity. \nB. A variety of oral antibiotics have been used for 7-10 days. \nRotating courses of antibiotics have been used in some \npatients. Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed antibiotic that \nhas been useful. \nC. Correct calcium as well as vitamin A, D, K, and B12 deficiency. \nD. Minimizing carbohydrates, especially lactose, can be helpful. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Inflammatory \nbowel disease (IBD) \nCrohn disease is a transmural process that may affect the entire GI \ntract from mouth to anus whereas ulcerative colitis is a mucosal \ndisease limited to the colon. Both occur more often in patients \nof Jewish descent and among patients with a family history of \nIBD. Extraintestinal manifestations of IBD may include uveitis, \nerythema nodosum, pyoderma granulosum, large or small joint \nperipheral arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, primary sclerosing \ncholangitis, secondary amyloidosis, and venous thromboembolism. \nChronic colitis increases the risk of colon cancer in proportion to \nthe amount of the colon involved and the duration of disease. \n1. Crohn Disease \nTatbook Presentation \nCommon complaints include chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, \nfever, weight loss, enterocutaneous fistulas, and acute abdominal \npain (which can mimic acute appendicitis). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Patchy, transmural inflammation can lead to fistula formation, \nphlegmon, strictures with obstruction, perforation, abscess \nformation, and peritonitis. \nB. Manifestations \n1. The disease course is characterized by exacerbations and \nremissions. \n2. Typically presents with insidious onset of symptoms \nof weight loss, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, although \noccasionally acute symptoms (eg, acute toxic megacolon \nor acute ileitis mimicking acute appendicitis) are the \npresenting manifestations of Crohn disease. \n3. Can involve any part of the GI tract with normal \"skip areas\" \nberween involved areas. At presentation: \na. = 20% of patients had ileitis, 45% ileocolltis, and 33% \ncolitis. Upper GI involvement can occur. \nb. = 27% had strictures or perforation \n4. Perianal or rectal fistulas occur in 14-3 7% of patients. \n5. Diarrhea {with or without gross bleeding), weight loss, \nabdominal pain, and fever are common. \n6. Diarrhea may occur due to \na. Small bowel disease impairing absorption \nb. Ileal disease \n(1) May decrease bile salt absorption, allowing bile salts \ninto the colon, which cause irritation and diarrhea. \n(2) Severe bile salt malabsorption also causes bile salt \ndeficiency and steatorrhea. \nc. Bacterial overgrowth secondary to strictures \n7. Obstruction due to strictures \n8. Fistulas may be enterocutaneous fistulas (most commonly \nperianal), enterovesicular (resulting in polymicrobial \nurinary tract infections), enterovaginal, or enteroentcric \n(bowel to bowel). \n9. B12 deficiency (secondary to Heal disease) \n10. Calcium oxalate kidney stones \na. Normal GI oxalate absorption is limited by intraluminal \nintestinal binding of oxalate to calcium. \nb. Malabsorption increases intraluminal fat. lntraluminal \nfat binds intraluminal calcium decreasing calcium's \navailability to oxalate. \nc. This leads to increased oxalate absorption. \nd. Increased oxalate absorption causes hyperoxaluria and \npromotes the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones. \n11. Osteoporosis due to vitamin D deficiency, calcium \nmalabsorption, and prolonged conicosteroid therapy. \n12. Gross bleeding is less frequent in Crohn disease than in \nulcerative colitis. \n13. Aphthous ulcers \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. When considering a diagnosis of Crohn disease, imponant \nhistorical features are changes in weight, abdominal pain, fever, \na personal history of recent antibiotic or NSAID use (to con-\nsider the likelihood of C difficik- or NSAID-associated colitis), \nsymptoms or history of ex:traintestinal manifestations (uveitis, \narthritis, or erythema nodosum) and family history ofIBD. \nB. The physical exam should include weight (and changes from \nprior); vital signs; and oral, abdominal, rectal, and dermato-\nlogic exams. \nC. Initial laboratory studies should include a CBC, comprehen-\nsive metabolic panel, ESR, CRP, vitamin B12, and folate. \nD. Active infection with the following organisms should be \nexcluded in patients with diarrhea: Salmonella, Shigt/la, \nCampylobacter, Yminia, Eschmchia coli 0157:H7. Giardia, \nC difficik, and E histolytica. C difficile has increasing prevalence \n(even in the absence of antibiotic use} and must be excluded prior \nto initiating therapy. \nE. Colonoscopy with ileoscopy and biopsy is often diagnostic but \nmay be contraindicated in acute severe colitis. \nF. Upper endoscopy may be useful in patients with concurrent \ndyspepsia. \nG. Diagnostic imaging \n1. A variety of imaging techniques are available to visualize the \nsmall bowel for diagnosis and are useful in the following \nsituations: \na. When colonoscopy/ileoscopy fails to establish the diagnosis \n\nb. Evaluation of complications (ie, strictures, abscesses) \nand disease extent \nc. Options include ultrasound, small bowel follo\nthrough, enteroclysis, CT enterography, CT \nenteroc:lysis, MR enterography, MR enteroc:lysis, and \ncapsule endoscopy. \n2. The precise role of imaging studies is not yet defined. Local \nexpertise and availability may guide choices. \na. MR enterography \n(1) Avoids radiation \n(2) Can detect abscesses \n(3) May distinguish flbrotic from inflammatory \nstrictures \n(4) Recommended as the preferred technique \nb. CT \n(1) Widely available \n(2) Can detect abscesses \n(3) Associated with radiation risks (whic:h may be of \nparticular importance in young patients needing \nserial examinations) \n(4) Requires N contrast with risk of hypersensitivity \nreactions and renal complications. \nc. Capsule endoscopy \n(1) Can visualize aphthous ulcers not visible on MRI \norCT \n(2) Some studies suggest improved sensitivities over \nMRandCT \n(3) Capsules may get lodged in strictures. \n(4) Guidelines suggest ruling out strictures prior to \ncapsule endoscopy with either small bowel follo\nthrough, CT enterography, or MR enterography. \n(S) A capsule that auto-dissolves has been developed. \nd. Ultrasound is inexpensive but operator dependent and \ncannot provide a comprehensive evaluation of the bowel. \nTreatment \nA. Therapeutic: goals include the induction and maintenance of \nremission. \n1. Options include 5-aminosalic:ylic acid (5-ASA), budesonide \nor conventional corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), \nmethotrexate, antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, \ncyclosporine, tac:rolimus, and natalizumab. \n2. 5-ASA and corticosteroids may be given systemically or \ntopically (as enemas or suppositories). \nB. Antibiotics are often necessary for bacterial overgrowth, \nperitonitis, or abscesses (whic:h may also require drainage). \nC. It is vital to rule out concomitant infection with an enteric \npathogen in a patient presenting with a flare ofIBD. Further, \nc:ytomegalovirus coinfection may be a factor in many flares. \nD. Smoking cessation is associated with a 65% reduction in relapse. \nE. Adjunctive therapy \n1. Treat lactose intolerance if present. \n2. Assess and replete vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D, zinc, iron, \nand calcium as necessary. \n3. Total parenteral nutrition may be necessary in patients \nunable to maintain adequate nutrition, although this is \nuncommon and should generally be avoided when possible. \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 583 \n4. Bile acid resins for patients with watery diarrhea and ileal \ndisease. \n5. Periodic colonoscopy to monitor for colon cancer in \npatients with colonic involvement. \n6. Surgery \na. 50% of patients require surgery in the first 10 years. \nb. Not curative. High rate of recurrence following surgery \n(10-15%/year clinical recurrence, 80% endoscopic \nrecurrence). \nc. Indications include the management of massive \nhemorrhage, fulminant colitis, abscesses, peritonitis, \nobstruction, or disease refractory to medical therapy. \n7. Avoid NSAIDs and opioids if possible. \n8. Vaccinations \na. Patients should receive influenza, pneumococcal, and \nhuman papillomavirus vaccines according to published \nrecommendations. \nb. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended in the \nnonimmune patients prior to immunosuppressive or \nanti-TNF therapy. \nc. Live vaccines (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG]; \nmeasles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]; oral polio; live \ntyphoid; and varicella) should be avoided in patients \ntaking immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids. \nUlcerative Colitis \nTextbook Presentation \nTypically, bloody diarrhea and fecal urgency are the presenting \nsymptoms. Like Crohn disease, the clinical course is typically one \nof exacerbations and remissions. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Primarily mucosal disease. (Occasionally, severe inflammation \nmay extend deeper, involving muscular layers resulting in dys-\nmotility and toxic megacolon.) \nB. Strictly limited to colon, in contrast to Crohn disease. \nC. Starts at rectum and proceeds proximally in a continuous \nfashion; may be limited to rectum or involve rectosigmoid \nor entire c:olon. Rectal sparing suggests another disease \n(ie, Crohn disease). \nD. Decreased risk among smokers (in contrast to Crohn disease) \nE. Anemia, fever, and increasing diarrhea are seen with more \nextensive disease. \nF. Complications \n1. Massive hemorrhage (rare) \n2. Anemia \n3. Toxic megac:olon \n4. Stricture \n.5. Colon cancer \na. The cancer risk is increased except in patients with just \nproctitis or very distal colitis. \nb. Increased risk of colon cancer begins 7-8 years after the \nonset of disease. \nEviden~Based Diagnosis \nA. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy demonstrates loss of vascular \nmarkings, erythema, friability, and exudates in a continuous \nfashion extending from the rectum proximally. \n\n584 I CHAPTER 32 \nB. Biopsy specimen reveals c:rypt abscesses, branching crypts, and \nglandular atrophy. \nC. Patients should be asked abour travel history or recent antibi-\notic use that increases the likelihood of bacterial gastroenteritis \nor C difficik colitis. Stool samples should be sent to exclude \nac:ute infectious processes (Salmonella, Shigel/a, Campylobacter, \nE co/i 0157:H7. C di.fficile, E histolytica). Biopsy is often done \nto exclude cytomegalovirus. \nD. The diagnosis is typically made in patients with characteristic \nendoscopic and pathologic findings in the absence of infec-\ntion. Small bowel imaging can be also useful if Crohn disease \nis considered (small bowel involvement suggests Crohn disease \nsince ulcerative colitis does not affect the small bowel). \nE. NSAIDs may cause colitis and their use as a cause of colitis \nshould also be excluded. \nTreatment \nA. Patients should be monitored for relapse regularly and asked \nabout diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and systemic symptoms. The \npatient's weight and hemoglobin should be monitored. \nB. Decisions regarding choice of therapy depend on a combina-\ntion of disease location and severity. \n1. Distal disease (descending colon and beyond) can often \nbe treated with topical preparations {suppositories or \nenemas). Options include topical preparations of 5-ASA \nor corticosteroids {suppositories, enemas, or foams) or oral \n5-ASA preparations. \n2. More proximal or severe disease requires systemic therapy. \n3. Therapy is also intensified in patients with severe disease \nmanifested by greater stool frequency, increased bleeding, \nsystemic symptoms (fever, tachycardia, anemia, elevated \nCRP, and elevated ESR) or sigmoidoscopic: appearance. \nC. Oral or systemic: corticosteroids can be added for more severe \ndisease or nonresponders. \nD. Cyclosporine, 6MP, and infliximab have been effective in \nsome patients with severe, corticosteroid-refractory disease. \nE. Antibiotics may be useful in select ill patients, particularly \nthose with toxic megac:olon or peritonitis. \nF. 5-ASA preparations {but not topical corticosteroids) are effec-\ntive at maintaining remission. 6MP and infliximab can also be \neffective. \nG. Surgery (colectomy) is curative. Indications include: \n1. Patients with high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or \ncancer on surveillance colonoscopy. Low-grade dysplasia \nshould also prompt consideration for colectomy. \n2. Other severe complications including massive hemorrhage, \nperforation, and toxic megacolon. \n3. Intractable disease \nH. Adjuvant therapy \n1. Persistent diarrhea \na. Test for lactose intolerance. \nb. Avoid fresh fruits, vegetables, and caffeine. \n2. Surveillance colonoscopy for colon cancer for ulcerative \ncolitis and Crohn disease begins 8 years after diagnosis and \nthen every 1-2 years. \n3. Supplemental iron \n4. Fish oils and nicotine (transdermal) have been \ndemonstrated to induce remission in some patients. \nS. Total parenteral nutrition if patients are unable to maintain \nadequate nutrition, but this is to be avoided when at all \npossible. \n6. Antidiarrheals may increase the increased risk of toxic: \nmegacolon. \n7. Screen patients who have been taking corticosteroids for \n> 3 months for osteoporosis and provide calcium and \nvitamin D supplementation. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nMr. Xs history and CT scan point strongly toward chronic pan-\ncreatitis. IBD is possible but unlikely. Since bacterial overgrowth \ncan complicate chronic pancreatitis, an empiric trial of antibiotics \ncould be given if therapy for chronic pancreatitis is unsuccessful. \nMr. A Is given pancreatic enzymes to take with meals \nand snacks. He sul:15equently reports that his dlarrhea \nand bloating are greatly improved. Six months later he is \nback to his baseline weight and he remains austintmt from \nalcohol. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nCeliac Disease \nTextbook Presentation \nClassically, chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss are \npresent. Iron and vitamin deficiencies may be seen. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Occurs worldwide. Prevalence\"' 0.5-1% in Northern \nEuropeans; affects women 1.5 times more often than men. \nB. Develops only in persons with either the HLA-DQ2 or \nHLA-DQ8 haplotype. \n1. Develops in only a subset of such patients \n2. Those haplotypes expressed on antigen presenting cell \nsurfaces can bind the dearninated gluten peptide found in \nwheat, rye, and barley. \n3. This triggers an abnormal immune response within the \nintestinal mucosa with subsequent mucosal injury, atrophy, \nand malabsorption. \n4, Antibodies devdop to gliadin, transglutaminase (tTG), and \nendomysin (EMA). \nC. Clinical manifestations \n1. Usually presents between ages 10 and 40 years, although \nmay be recognized in older patients. \n2. Symptoms precipitated by exposure to wheat, rye, or barley \nprotein {gluten) and resolve within weeks to months on \ngluten-free diet. \n3. Diarrhea is seen in 27-50% of patients. Patients may also \nhave weight loss (6-22%), unexplained iron deficiency \nancmia, osteoporosis, aphthous stomatitis, or abnormal \nliver biochemical tests; however, they also may be \nasymptomatic:. \n4. Osteopenia and osteoporosis may develop due to vitamin D \ndeficiency and subsequent secondary hyperparathyroidism. \n\n5. Strongly associated with dermatitis herpetiformis in \na minority of patients, which develops secondary to \nantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase. \n6. Far more common in patients with trisomy 21. \n7. Increase risk of other autoimmune disorders including \nthyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. \n8. Patients with celiac disease are at increased risk for \nintestinal adenocarcinoma and enteropathy-associated \nT cell lymphoma. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Diagnostic options include duodenal biopsy (the gold standard), \nserology, and clinical response to a gluten-free diet. \nB. Small bowel biopsy is the gold standard and useful but \ninvasive. Strategies can help determine when biopsies are \nnecessary. \nC. Serologic testing is highly accurate but not perfect. \n1. Tissue glutaminase antibody (IgA TTG) \na. Very accurate: 90-98% sensitive, 95-97% specific; \n.. LR+ 24, LR- 0.06 \nb. Simpler, cheaper, and less operator dependent than \nIgAEMA \nc. Initial test of choice \n2. Endomysial antibody (IgA EMA) also very accurate: \n85-98% sensitive, 97-100% specific; LR+ 61, LR- 0.06. \n3. There are several causes of false-negative serologies, \nincluding \na. lgA deficiency: lgG TTG antibodies or deaminated \ngliadin peptide antibodies can be tested when the \nsuspicion is high and IgA levels are loor absent. \nNo \nCeliac \ndisease \nruled out \nDiarrhea, weight loss, \nabdominal pain, \nunexplained Iron \ndeficiency anemia \nConsider celiac disease \nNegative \nUNINTENTIONAL WEIGHT LOSS I 585 \nb. Gluten-free diets: lgA TIG and lgA EMA levels fall \n(and may become negative) in patients on gluten-free \ndiet. (Increasing titers in patients with celiac disease \nsuggest dietary noncompliance.) \nD. HLA typing \n1. Vinually all patients with celiac disease express HLA-DQ2 \nor HLA-DQ8 heterodimers. \na. 100% sensitive but only 57-75% specific \nb. LR+, 2.3; LR-, 0 \n2. Celiac disease can be virtually ruled out in patients who are \nnegative for HLA-DQ2 or HAL-DQ8. \n3. Maybe useful in patients who instituted a gluten-free \ndiet before evaluation in whom IgA tTG and lgA EMA \nantibody levels may be lodue to decreased disease activity. \nIf the patient expressed neither HLA-DQ haplotype, celiac \ndisease could be excluded. \nE. Due to the looverall prevalence of celiac disease, positive \nEMA and tTG serologies do not confirm the diagnosis, \ndespite their high specificity. \n1. The positive predictive value ranges from 29% to 76% and \nsmall bowel biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. \n2. In contrast, negative EMA and tTG serologies make the \ndiagnosis very unlikely (negative predictive value= 99%) \nand essentially rule out the disease. \n3. If concern remains despite a negative result, HLA typing \ncould help completely exclude the disease. \n4. One approach is shown in Figure 32-5. \nF. Certain patients complain of gluten-related symptoms and \nimprovement on a gluten-free diet despite negative serologi.es and \nbiopsy. Such patients may have an ill-<iefined gluten sensitivity. \nPositive \nPositive \nPositive \nCellac \ndisease \nFigure 32-5. Diagnostic approach: celiac disease. \n\n586 I CHAPTER 32 \nTreatment \nA. Gluten-free diet (no wheat, rye, and barley) \nB. Oats that are uncontaminated with gluten are usually tolerated \nin patients with ccliac disease. \nC. Lactose avoidance may be necessary due to concomitant lactasc \ndcflciency. \nD. Correct iron, folic acid, vitamin 8 12, and vitamin D deficiencies. \nE. Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended by some experts. \nF. Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressives have rarely been \nnecessary in patients with refractory celiac disease. \nG. Osteoporosis screening is recommended. \nREFERENCES \nAmerican Psydtlaaic Association. Dittgnomc and Stllli.stkal Manual of Mmtlli \nDUortkn, 5th ed. DSM-5.

Howould ;you frame the \ndifferential? \nCONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nWheezing and stridor are symptoms of airfloobstruction caused \nby the vibration of the walls of pathologically narroairways. \nWheezing is a high-pitch musical sound produced primarily dur-\ning expiration by airways of any size. Strid.or is a single high-pitch, \ninspiratory sound that is produced by large airways with severe \nnarrowing; it may be caused by severe obstruction of any proximal \nairway. \nStrid.or is often a sign of impending airway \nobstruction and should be considered an \nemergency. \nDistinguishing between wheezing and strider is essential. \nTypically, patients with either wheezing or stridor describe their \nsymptoms simply as wheezing. The physical exam will determine \nwhether the patient actually has wheezing or stridor. Because the \ndifferential diagnosis for airway obstruction is extensive, an ana-\ntomic approach is helpful. \nA. Stridor \n1. Nasopharynx and oropharynx \na. Tonsillar hypertrophy \nb.

The presence of wheezing, chest tightness, and \nshortness of breath are pivotal clues that place asthma at the top of the \ndiffi:rential diagnosis. Although asthma is by far the most likdy diag-\nnosis, other diseases that could account for recurrent symptoms of \nairway obstruction should be considered (Table 33-1). Allergic rhini-\ntis can cause cough and wheezing. but it would be very unusual for it \nto cause shortness of breath. Vocal cord dysfunction, such as PVCM, \nis frequently confused with asthma and can cause recurrent stridor. \nCOPD can also cause chronic wheezing and pulmonary symptoms. \n\n588 I CHAPTER 33 \nDifferentiate wheezing from stridor \nWheezing \nStridor \n+ \nIs the wheezing acute or chronic? \nIs the strtdor acute or chronic? \nChronic \nI Acute \nChronic \nAcute \n+ \n+ \nWork-up usually involves spirometry and \nCommon causes of chronic strldor Include \nPatients with acute stridor need \nimaging to make a diagnosis.

If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nLeading Hypothesis: Asthma \nTextbook Presentation \nAsthma commonly presents as recurrent episodes of dyspnea, often \nwith chest tightne~, cough, and wheezing. Patients usually report \nstereotypical triggers {eg, allergens, cold weather, exercise) and \nrapid response to beta-agonist inhalers. \nAsthma is a common cause of wheezing; however, \nthe absence of wheezing by no means excludes \nthe diagnosis of asthma. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Definition: The definition of asthma in the National Asthma \nEducation and Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report \nWHEEZING AND STRIDOR I 589 \nis \"A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways in which \nmany cells and cellular dements play a role.\" \"In susceptible \nindividuals, this inflammation causes recurrent episodes of \nwheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, panic~ \nularly at night and/or in the early morning. These episodes \nare usually associated with widespread but variable airflo\nllmitation that is often reversible either spontaneously or with \ntreatment.\" \nB. Clinical manifestations \n1. Asthma is recurrent and intermittent. \na. Most patients will have periods with no, or only mild, \nsymptoms. \nb. Patients with severe disease will have persistent \nsymptoms. \n2. Asthma usually presents during childhood but presentation \nas an adult is not uncommon. \n3. Airway function fluctuates in people with asthma more \nwidely than in those without the diagnosis. \na. Airway function is most commonly measured by peak \nexpiratory flo(PEF). \nb. Values are generally lowest in the morning and highest \nat mid-day. \nc. PEF will vary by more than 20% in asthmatic patients \nover the course of the day. \n4. Identifying exacerbating factors and timing of symptoms is \nimportant. It aids in the diagnosis of asthma (exacerbating \nfactors are stereotypical) and in treatment (if the factors are \navoidable or reversible). \na. Asthma frequently worsens at night (probably related \nto decreased mucociliary clearance, airway cooling, and \nlolevels of endogenous catecholamines). \nb. Asthma frequently worsens with exercise (probably \nrelated to airway cooling and drying). \nc. Viral infections are a common cause of asthma \nexacerbations. \ncl A long list of airway irritants and occupational agents \nmay cause or exacerbate asthma by a number of \nmechanisms: \n(1) Cigarette smoke, perfumes, exhaust \n(2) Corrosive agents (ammonia) \n(3) Pharmacologic agents (organophosphates) \n(4) Reflex bronchoconstriction {ozone) \n(S) IgE-mediated (latex) \nAsthma should be in the differential diagnosis \nof any patient with intermittent respiratory \nsymptoms. \nC. Classification: The present classification scheme for asthma \nhelps focus attention on the severity of the asthma and \ndovetails nicely with treatment considerations (Table 33-2). \nIt should be noted, however, that by necessity this scheme \nsimplifies asthma phenotypes and many patients do not flt \nwell into a single category. \nD. Exacerbations or \"flares\" \nI. Asthma exacerbations are periods of increased disease \nactivity identified by increased \na. Airfloobstruction \nb. Symptoms \nc. Medication use \n\n590 I CHAPTER 33 \nTable 33-2.

Exacerbations may or may not be caused by an identifiable \ntrigger. \n3. Management of an exacerbation depends on an accurate \nassessment of the cause of the exacerbation and the risk to \nthe patient. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. There is no single test to diagnose asthma; the diagnosis is \nclinical, based on multiple findings in the history, physical \nexam, and spirometry. \nB. Asthma is easily recognized when it presents with intermittent \nwheezing; in fact, the diagnosis is often made by the patient. \nC. Diagnosing asthma is challenging when it presents in atyp-\nical ways. Asthma should be high in the differential diag-\nnosis when a patient has any of the following intermittent \nsymptoms: \nI. Wheezing \n2. Dyspnea \n3. Cough \n4. Chest tightness \nD. The key points in establishing the diagnosis of asthma are: \n1. Episodic symptoms of airfloobstruction \n2. Reversibility of the airfloobstruction \n3. Exclusion of other likely diseases \nE. There are not great data on the test characteristics of various \nsymptoms of asthma. \n1. One large study interviewed nearly 10,000 healthy, \ncommunity-dwelling people regarding pulmonary \nsymptoms in the preceding 12 months. \na. 225 of these people had asthma, defined as reporting \nthat they had asthma and that a medical professional \nhad confirmed the diagnosis. \n/\\ b. The test characteristics of the most predictive historical \nLEn \nfeatures are shown in Table 33-3. \nc. It is important to note that these test characteristics were \nderived in a healthy population. Specificities would be \nlower in a population containing patients with other \ncardiopulmonary diseases. \n2. In another study, which used a methacholine challenge \ntest to diagnose asthma, 90% specificity was achieved for \nmaking the diagnosis of asthma with the question, \"Do you \ncough during or after exercise?\" \nF. Other clues that make the diagnosis more likely are outlined \nin the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's \nExpert Panel Report: \n1. Diurnal variability in PEF (> 20% variability between best \nand worst) \n2. Symptoms occur or worsen in the presence of: \na. Exercise \nb. Viral infections \nc. Animals with fur or hair \nd. House dust mites \ne. Mold \nf. Smoke \ng. Pollen \nh. Weather changes \ni. Laughing or hard crying \nj. Airborne chemicals or dust \n3. Symptoms occur or worsen at night. \nG. There is some evidence that people with asthma describe their \ndyspnea differently from people with other cardiorespiratory \ndiseases. They are more likely to refer to symptoms of chest \ntightness or constriction. \nH. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) \nTable33-3.

The results are useful both as a diagnostic: test \nand to provide objective data to be used in determining \nmanagement. \n2. Figure 33-2 shows a schematic: diagram of many of the lung \nvolumes, capacities, and flows measured in PFTs. \n3. The following all support the diagnosis of asthma: \na. Decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) \nb. Decreased FEY/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio \nc. Reversibility (defined as at least a 200 mL increase in \nFEV1 and > 12% improvement with bronc:hodilators) \nI. Other tests \n1. Chest radiography is useful mainly in excluding other diseases. \n2. Methac:holine c:hallenge \na. Useful for diagnosing (or excluding) asthma in patients \nwho have a suspicious history but normal PFTs \nb. A decrease in FEV1 of< 20% has a 95% negative \npredictive value. \nTreatment \nA. The goals of asthma therapy are to \n1. Prevent chronic symptoms (dyspnea, exercise intolerance, \nnighttime wakening) \n2. Maintain normal pulmonary function (assessed by PEF and \nspirometry) \n3. Maintain normal levds of physical activity. \na. It can be challenging to achieve this goal. \nb. Many patients become ac:c:ustomed to being limited \nby their breathing and thus may not report that their \nbreathing limits their activity. \n4. Prevent exacerbations \nB. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's \nExpert Pand Report lists 4 components of asthma care. \n1. Periodic: evaluation to assess asthma severity and monitor \nwhether asthma control is achieved and maintained. \nThis entails ac:c:urately diagnosing the severity of patients' \nsymptoms at baseline and during therapy. \nFRC \n----i-------\nRV \nTLC \nWHEEZING AND STRIDOR I 591 \n2. Patient education \n3. Control of environmental factors and comorbid conditions \nthat affect asthma. This may include pharmac:ologic and \nnonpharmacologic interventions for, among others, the \nfollowing: \na. Tobacco use and secondhand smoke \nb. Air pollution (ozone, S02, N02) \nc. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERO) \nd. Common allergens \ne. Dander, dust, mold, insects \nIt is critical to control diseases and factors that \nexacerbate asthma in order to achieve control \nwith the least intensive regimen possible. \n4, Medication use \na. Medical therapy for asthma itself is aimed at treating \nthe factors that cause the disease and its symptoms. \nThe drugs are summarized in Table 33-4. \nb. The current guidelines advocate a stepwise approach to \nmanagement. Step 1 is for patients with intermittent \nasthma and steps 2-6 build on one another for worsening \nlevels of persistent asthma. \n(1) Step 1: Short-acting beta-2-agonists used as needed. \n(2) Step 2: Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. \n(3) Step 3: Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids with long-\nac:ting beta-2-agonists. An alternative at this point is \nmedium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. \n(4) Step 4: Medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids with \nlong-acting beta-2-agonists. \n(S) Step 5: High-dose inhaled corticosteroids with \nlong-acting beta-2-agonists with consideration of \nomalizumab for patients with allergies \n(6) Step 6: High-dose inhaled corticosteroids with long-\nacting beta-2-agonists and oral corticosteroids with \nconsideration of omalizwnab for patients with allergies \nc. Consideration should be given for escalating therapy \nwhenever short-acting beta-2-agonists are being used \nmore than twice a week. \n1 \n6 \nFVC \n~5 \nd. \nCD \nE 4 \n::I \n~ 3 \n0 \n2 \n4 \nTime (sec) \nFigure 33-2.

Refractory asthma: Although most cases of asthma can be well \ncontrolled, there are patients whose asthma is refractory to the \nstandard therapy. This may be due to the inherent severity of \nthe disease or other factors: \nI. Problem with adherence to prescribed regimen. This includes \npoor inhaler technique (common) and poor understanding \nof the use of maintenance and as-needed medications. \n2. Unrecognized or uncreated precipitants, such as GERD, \nsinusitis, and allergies. \n3. Incorrect diagnosis; consider other causes of chronic \nintermittent airway obsttuction such as PVCM, COPD, \nor sarcoid. \n4. The presence of rare diseases that can cause or worsen \nasthma, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis \n(formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome) or allergic \nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis. \nD. Exacerbations \n1. History \na. Duration of exacerbation \n(1) Exacerbations that are very recent (hours) and mild \nmay improve with beta-agonists alone, while more \nestablished and more severe exacerbations require \ncorticosteroids. \n(2) Because early treatment leads to better outcomes, it \nis important that patients monitor their own disease \nand knohoto initiate appropriate treatment and \ncontact their physician when necessary. \nb. Precipitants \n(1) Consider if there is a precipitant of the exacerbation \nthat needs to be addressed (eg, sinusitis, allergen \nexposure). \n(2) Consider if there is an exacerbating factor that \nhospital admission might alleviate (eg, house painting, \nrecent insect extermination). \nc:. Severity of disease. The following patients are at risk for \nasthma-related death. Any patient with an exacerbation \nand 1 of these factors require special attention with \nregards to education, monitoring, and care: \n(1) Previous severe exacerbations \n(2) Multiple, recent emergency department visits or \nhospitali7.ations \n(3) Use of more than 2 canisters of beta-agonise in the \npast month \n(4) Current use or recent discontinuation of systemic \ncorticosteroids \n(S) Difficulty perceiving airfloobstruction \n(6) Losocioeconomic status or inner-city residence \n(7) Illicit drug use \n(8) Comorbid medical or psychiatric disease \nAny patient with risk factors for asthma-related \ndeath who presents with an asthma exacerba-\ntion requires special attention, beginning with \nserious consideration for hospitalization. \n2. Physical exam \na. The lung exam is generally a poor marker of the severity \nof disease. \nb. Lack of wheezing can either reflect improved or \nworsening airflow. \nPatients whose decreased wheezing is accompa-\nnied by worsening distress, diminished breath \nsounds, or decreased mental status probably have \nworsening airfloobstruction. Conversdy, a \npatient whose decreased wheezing is accompanied \nby lessened respiratory distress and normal breath \nsounds likely has improved airfloobstruction. \n\nWHEEZING AND STRIDOR I 593 \nI \nInitial assessment \n- ' \nt \nM lld - moderate exacerbation \nSevere exacerbation based on \nImpending or actual \nbased on symptoms, signs, and \nsymptoms, signs, and PEF/FEV1 \nrespiratory arrest \nPEF/FEV1 :!: 40% of predicted \n< 40% of predicted \n- t \nTreat with oxygen, inhaled \nTreat with oxygen, inhaled \nIntubate and treat with oxygen, \nbeta-2-agonists, and possibly oral \nbeta-2-agonists and ipratropium, \ninhaled beta-2-agonists and \ncorticosteroids \nand oral corticosteroids \nlpratropium, and IV corticosteroids \nI \nt \nI \nFollow-up assessment \nI \nI \nt \nt \nGood response (PEF/FEV1 :!: 70% \nIncomplete response (PEF/FEV1 \nPoor response \nof predicted, sustained response \n(PEF/FEV1 < 40o/o of predicted \n60 minutes after therapy, normal \n40--69% of predicted and mild to \nand severe symptoms possibly \nphysical exam) \nmoderate symptoms) \nincluding drowsiness and confusion) \nt \nBase discharge decision on patient \nhistory, knowledge, and support \nI \n. \ni \ni \nProbable discharge to home with beta-2-agonists, \nIntensive care unit \noral corticosteroids and initiation (or escalation) \nHospital admission \nadmission \nor inhaled corticosteroids \nFigure 33--3.

Expert Panel Report 3: guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma: full report 2007.) \n3. Other tests \na. Spirometry is crucial in determining severity of \nexacerbation. \n(1) A mild exacerbation is defined by symptoms only \nwith activity and a FEY1 or PEF or ~ 70% of \npredicted. \n(2) A moderate exacerbation includes symptoms with \nusual activities and a FEY1 or PEF 40-69% of \npredicted. \n(3) In a severe exacerbation, patients have dyspnea at \nrest and dyspnea that interferes with conversation \nand a FEV1 or PEF < 40% of predicted. \nSpirometry and the history of the patient's prior \nexacerbations are the most important pieces of \ninformation for making admission decisions. \nb. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are useful in patients whose \npeak flows are not improving with treatment. ABGs \nduring severe exacerbations should reveal a respiratory \nalkalosis. A respiratory acidosis (or even a normal PC02 \nduring a severe exacerbation} is very worrisome because it \nsuggests severe airway narrowing and respiratory fatigue. \nc. Chest radiograph is only helpful for identifying the \nuncommon concomitant infection or complication (eg, \npneumothorax). \n4. Treatment of exacerbations. Figure 33-3 is a guide to the \nmanagement of asthma exacerbations. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nMr. C was scheduled for spirometry and prescribed an alb-\nuterol inhaler. He was told to use 2 puffs as needed as well \nas 30 minutes before exercise or expected ani ma I exposure. \nOn follow-up 6 weeks later. Mr. C reported Improvement In \nhis symptoms. He was able to exercise wit hout difficulty \nas long as he was using his inhalers and could spend short \namounts of t ime around friends' pets. \n(cont inued) \n\n594 I CHAPTER 33 \nSplrometry revealed an FEV1 of 70% of predicted that \nnormalized with altluterol. \nAt folloup a femonths later he reported that he \nwas using hl5 altluterol Inhaler dally to maintain hl5 a5thma \ncontrol. \nHave you c::ro5eed a dlagnoetlc:: thre9hold \nfor the leading hypothesie, asthma? Have \nyou rulsd out ths active altsrnativa&1 Do \nothsr tsete nsed to bs dons to sxcluds ths \naltsrnatlvs dlagnOHe1 \nMr. C's clinical history is consistent with asthma. The history of \nchildhood asthma both makes asthma the most likely diagnosis \nand makes his complaint of\"wheezing\" more rdiable. The absence \nof wheezing on exam certainly does not exclude the diagnosis of \nasthma. He has intermittent symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, \nand chest tightness. The presence of exacerbating factors and the \nresults of spirometry further raise the likelihood of asthma as the \ndiagnosis. \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMre;. P Is a 62-year-old woman who arrlve5 at the emer-\ngency department with 5hortne55 of breath and wheezing. \nShe 5ays that the 5ymptoms have been pre5ent for 3 days. \nThe symptom5 are present both at rest and with exertion \nand have not Improved with an albuterol Inhaler. \nShe reports that she has had these symptoms interm it-\ntently for6 yea re;. When the symptoms occur. they generally \nlast for hours to a feday5. She had been diagnosed with \nasthma and took long- and 5hort-actlng beta-agonlsts and \ninhaled and systemic cortico5teroids, before coming off all \nmedications 1 year ago. She stopped her medications out of \nfrustration with side effects and perceived lack of efficacy. \nShe decided Instead to treat herself with y09a and medita-\ntion. She reports no episodes since this decision. \nPresently she denies cough. chest pain, fever. or rhinitis. She \ndoes report hoarsenes5 that occurs when her breathing Is bad. \n~ At thle point, what 15 the lsadlng hypothnle, \n~Jiii\"' what are the actlws alternatives, and 15 there a \nmuet not miee diagl109ie1 Givsn thie differential \ndiagno&ie, what tsl!lt& ehould be ordered? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nAs discussed above, asthma is very common and should be \nconsidered in anyone with intermittent pulmonary symptoms. \nThe lack of symptom improvement with a beta-agonist and \nthe discontinuation of an aggressive asthma regimen without ill \neffects both argue against the diagnosis of asthma in this case. \nBecause asthma is very common and the initial \ntreatment is benign, the treatment threshold is \nlow. A therapeutic trial of medication is nearly \nalways appropriate. \nCASE RESOLUTION \nThe patient's history and response to therapy confirms the diagno-\nsis of asthma. The patient has no nasal symptoms that would sug-\ngest allergic rhinitis. CO PD is unlikely without a smoking history. \nVocal cord dysfunction will be discussed bdoand is also unlikdy. \nHeart failure is unlikely given the patient's age, the absence of a \nhistory of heart disease, and his response to bronchodil.ators. \n\nGiven the frequency of hl5 use of albuterol, t he patient wa5 \ngiven low-doee inhaled corticoeteroid 5.

(Hoarseness does sometimes occur with asthma if there is \nassociated GERO, postnasal drip, or vocal cord myopathy caused \nby inhaled corticosteroids.) Determining whether her symptoms \nare wheezing or stridor will help narrothe diagnosis. PVCM is \na syndrome of episodic adduction of the vocal cords producing \nstridor. The lack of response to bronchodilators and associated \nhoarseness are dues to this diagnosis. GERO is a very common \ndiagnosis {see Chapter 9). It can cause and worsen asthma and can \ncause hoarseness via irritation of the vocal cords. It is sometimes \nassociated with PVCM. Angioedema occurs when vascular per-\nmeability increases leading to tissue edema. Airway compromise \nand strider can occur. It is usually associated with other signs such \nas facial swdling, tongue swelling, or hives.

The respiratory dis-\ntress is often accompanied by voice pathology and does not respond \nto traditional asthma therapy. \n\nTable 33-5.

PVCM has gone by many names including vocal cord dys-\nfunction, episodic laryngeal dyskinesia, Munchausen stridor, \npsychogenic strider, and factitious asthma. \nB. Most commonly occurs in younger patients (< 35 years} but \ncan be seen in any age. \nC. Female predominance \nD. PVCM has been associated with a number of conditions and \nactivities including: \n1. Anxiety and other psychiatric conditions \n2. Exercise \n3. Airway injury (iatrogenic, inhalational) \n4. GERD \n5. Neurologic injury \nE. The symptoms are not produced consciously. \nF. During asymptomatic periods, there are no abnormalities of \nlung function. \n1. Spirometry is normal. \n2. There is none of the increased variability in airway function \nseen with asthma. \n3. Bronchial provocation tests are normal. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. Given the prevalence of asthma and the similarity of the \npresentation, asthma needs to be excluded in any patient \nin whom PVCM is suspected. This is especially true as the \n2 disorders may coexist. \nB. Clues to the differentiation of the diseases are: \nWHEEZING AND STRIDOR I 595 \n1. The lack of exacerbating factors (eg, exercise, allergens} and \ndiurnal variation seen with asthma. \n2. The lack of response to asthma medications. \n3. The occasional resolution of symptoms during sleep. \n4. The presence of voice pathology during attacks. \n5. The preponderance of auscultatory findings in the neck. \na. PVCM should really produce inspiratory stridor, as \nopposed to the predominantly expiratory wheezing \nheard with asthma. \nb. In practice, these can be hard to differentiate. \n6. A flattened inspiratory limb on flow-volume loops \nsuggesting variable extrathoracic airway obstruction. \nC. The definitive diagnosis is made during laryngoscopy. \n1. There is adduction of the vocal cords during flares. \n2. There is generally normal vocal cord function between flares. \nTreatment \nA. There are no controlled uials of treatments for PVCM. \nB. Speech therapy, concentrating on laryngeal relaxation seems to \nbe the most effective therapy. \nC. Psychiatric intervention is suggested for patients with psychi-\natric illness. \nD. Acute attacks may be quite hard to manage. \n1. Helium/oxygen mixtures have been suggested to obtain \nbetter flothrough the narrowed larynx though there is no \nevidence to support its utility. \n2.

The other important diag-\nnosis to consider at this point is angioedema. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Angioedema \nTextbook Presentation \nAngioedema presents with the acute swelling of soft tissues, espe-\ncially the face, lips, tongue, larynx, or foreskin. Bowel edema can \nresult in abdominal pain. Patients nearly always have a history of \nangioedema or a risk factor for it. \n\n596 I CHAPTER 33 \nDisease Highlights \nA. The onset of angiocdcma is usually rapid, over minutes to hours. \nB. Angioedema may be caused by: \n1. Medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] \ninhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n[NSAIDs] being, by fur, the most common culprits) \n2. Allergic reactions \n3. Hereditary and acquired forms of C I-inhibitor deficiency \nC. The presentation can range from mild, only sensed by the patient; \nto disfiguring, obvious to the casual observer; to life-threatening. \nD. The diverse causes of angioedema produce symptoms by dif-\nferent mechanisms, have different presentations, and different \ntreatments. \n1. Histamine-related angioedema \na. Almost always accompanied by pruritus and urticaria \n(hives). \nb. Usually related to an allergic exposure such as an insect \nbite or a food. \nc. Urticaria can also be chronic, caused by allergy, drug \neffect, autoimmune phenomena, or malignancy. \n2. Nonhistamine-related angioedema (caused by elevated \nlevels of bradykinin) \na. Most commonly the result of ACE inhibitor therapy \nb. Deficiency of C 1-inhibitor also causes elevated \nbradykinin levels as well as elevated C2b levels, another \ncause of angioedema. \n~ \nIf angioedema is associated with urticaria, it is \n,,.... not due to ACE inhibitor therapy. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. A diagnosis of angioedcrna is clinical, based on the recognition \nof angioedema and associated symptoms. \nB. Angioedema most commonly presents as swelling of the lips, \ntongue, or both. \nC. Figure 33-4 presents a useful algorithm for considering the \ndifferential diagnosis and treatment of angioedema. \nTreatment \nA. The most critical aspect of the management of angiocdcma is \nairway stabilization. \nB. All patients receive H 1 - and H 2 -blockers as well as \ncorticosteroids. \nC. Patients with airway compromise or any intraoral swelling \nshould also receive epinephrine. \nD. Patients need to be closely monitored because intubation is \nsometimes necessary. \nE. Patients with Cl-inhibitor deficiency can be treated with \nandrogens, which increase the production of Cl-inhibitor, \nor Cl-inhibitor concentrate. Patients with Cl-inhibitor defi-\nciency should also be counseled on avoiding estrogen contain-\ning medications. \nAngloedema \ndiagnosed by \nphysical exam \nIs there a clear \nexternal cause \n(allergen)? \nI \nDoes the patient \nhave hives or other \nsymptoms of an \nallergic reaction? \nI \nIs the patient taking \nmedications known to \ncause angioedema \n(ACE-I, NSAIDs)? \nI \nCounsel on Mure \navoidance \nEvaluate for \nautoimmune causes of \nurticaria if episodes are \npersistent or recurrent \nDiscontinue \nmedication \nEvaluate for \ncomplement deftciency \n(C4, C2, C1q, \nC 1-inhibltor) \nACE-I, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \nFigure 33-4. Differential diagnosis and treatment of angioedema. \n\nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nA helium oxygen mixture was given to the patient l'.lriefly \nbefore laryngoscoPY was performed. The findings on laryn-\n0<J5COPY were consistent with PVCM. The patient was coun-\nseled In the emergency department on ways to Improve her \nCHIEF COMPLAINT \nPATIENT \nMr. 5 is a 50-year-old man who arrives at the emergency \ndepartment with sore throat, fever, and wheezing. He \nreports being well until 2 days ago when his son!: throat \nstarted. Over the last 2 days, the sore throat became pro-\ngressively more severe and he lost his voice. On the morning \nof admission. a fever of 38.0\"C and wheezing developed. He \nwas also unable to eat because of the pain. He has never had \nsimilar symptoms. \nAt this point, what is the lsading hypothesis, \nwhat are the actlWJ altsmativff, and is there a \nmU9t not mlH diagno!!Me? Givan th'9 diffisrentlal \ndiagnosis, what tests should be ordtnd? \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe pivotal points in Mr. S's presentation are the acuity of the ill-\nness and the fever. Both of these points make an infectious etiology \nlikely. Because the symptoms are not recurrent, asthma (the most \ncommon cause of airway obstruction) is unlikely. Acute infectious \ncauses need to be considered first. These include common con-\nditions, such as pharyngitis, and rare but serious causes, such as \nepiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Angioedema is possible, \nbut the infectious symptotns (fever and pain) and the lack of visible \nswdling make this less likely. Aspiration of a foreign body could \ncause either a pneumonia or infection of the soft tissues of the neck \nresulting in fever. Table 33-6 lists the differential diagnosis. \nOn physical exam, Mr. 5 is in obvious distress. He is uncom-\nfortable, is sitting upright. and speaks in a muffled voice. His \nvltal signs are temperature, 38.3\"C; pulse, 110 bpm; BP, \n128/88 mm Hg; RR. 18 breaths per minute. Examination \nof the oropharynx is notable only for mild tonsillar edema \nwithout exudates. There is diffuse cervical lymphadenopa-\nthy and significant tendemess over the anterior neck. The \nneck Is supple. Lungs are clear. but there Is stridor trans-\nmitted from the neck. \n~~ Is the cllnical informa'tlon eufflcient to make a \n,~r dlagnoels1 If not, what other Information do \nyou need? \nWHEEZING AND STRIDOR I 597 \nairfloand symptoms subsided over the next hour. The \npatient spent 2 days In the hospital, experiencing only \n1 mild episode ofdyspnea during t he period of observat ion. \nLaryngoscopic findings can make the diagnosis of PVCM. Except \nfor her use of an ACE inhibitor, there is little evidence to support \nangioedema; the patient has no facial swelling, and there are no \nconsistent findings on laryngoscopy. \nTable 33-6.

In a patient with acute stridor and infectious symptoms, \nepiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess must top the differential \ndiagnosis. \nLeading Hypothesis: Epiglottitis \nTextbook Presentation \nFever and sore throat are usually the presenting symptoms. There \ncan be evidence of varying degrees of airway obstruction including \nwheezing, stridor, and drooling. The disease has become signifi-\ncantly less common in children since the development and use of \nthe Haemophilus influenzae B vaccine. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Epiglottitis is an infectious disease, classically caused by H \ninflumzae, which causes swdling of the epiglottis and supra-\nglottic structures. \nB. Because epiglottitis can rapidly cause airway compromise, the \ndiagnosis should always be considered an airway emergency. \nC. The classic presentation is a patient with sore throat, muffied \n\"hot potato\" voice, drooling, and stridor. \n\n598 I CHAPTER 33 \nD. H injluenzae is cultured in only a small percentage of adult \npatients; respiratory viruses are the likdy cause of most cases \nof epiglottitis. \nE. Early in its course, epiglottitis may resemble pharyngitis. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The gold standard for diagnosis is visual identification of \nswelling of the epiglottis. \nI. Otolaryngology consultation is thus mandatory if there is a \nsuspicion for the disease. \n2. Visualization can be achieved with direct or indirect \nlaryngoscopy. \n3. In patients with signs of severe disease (eg, muffied voice, \ndrooling, and stridor), an experienced physician should \nperform direct laryngoscopy and be prepared to intubate \nthe patient or perform a tracheostomy (if airway control \ncannot be obtained). \nB. The classic symptoms of muffied voice, drooling, and stridor \nare seen rarely and signify imminent airway obstruction. \nI. Stridor and the patient sitting in an erect posture are \nindependent predictors of subsequent airway intervention. \n2. The test characteristics of these signs for airway \nintervention are: \na. Stridor: Sensitivity, 42%; specificity, 94%; LR+, 7; \nLR-, 0.61. \nb. Sitting erect at presentation: Sensitivity, 47%; specificity, \n90%; LR+, 4.7; LR-. 0.59. \nC. Common symptoms and signs of epiglottitis (prevalence given \nin parentheses) \n1. Sore throat (95%) \n2. Odynophagia (94%) \n3. Muffled voice (54%) \n4. Pharyngitis (44%) \n5. Fever (42%) \n6. Cervical adenopathy (41%) \n7. Dyspnea (37%) \n8. Drooling (30%) \n9. Sitting erect (16%) \n10. Stridor (12%) \nD. Lateral neck films, a commonly used diagnostic tool, have a \nsensitivity of about 90%. The classic finding is the \"thumb \nsign\" of a swollen epiglottis. \nTreatment \nA normal lateral neck film does not rule out \nepiglottitis. Laryngoscopy should be performed \nin a patient with a high clinical suspicion of \nepiglottitis, even if the neck film is normal. \nA. Airway control \n1. All patients should be admitted to the intensive care unit \n(ICU) for close monitoring. \n2. Patients with signs or symptoms of airway obstruction \nshould be intubated electively. \n3. Elective intubation is preferred because intubation in a \npatient with epiglottitis can be very difficult. \n4. Some advocate prophylactic intubation of all patients. \nB. Epiglottitis is an airway emergency. \n1. Patients need to be monitored closely and not left alone \nuntil the airway is stable. \n2. Patients should be accompanied to radiology or other \ntesting. \nC. Antibiotics \nI. Antibiotics must be effective against H influenzae. \n2. Second- or third-generation cephalosporins are usually \nrecommended. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \nMr. S's history is very concerning. His upright posture, voice \nchanges, and stridor not only strongly suggest epiglonitis but also \nimminent airway closure. Foreign-body aspiration does not fit the \nhistory. Retropharyngeal abscess remains a possibility. \n\nGiven the concern for epiglottit is, lateral neck films were \nof7talned. and an atola ryngologlst was called to examine t he \npatient's upper airway. \nHave you croeeed a dlagnoetlc threehold for \nthe leading hypothe&ls, eplglottltls1 Have \nyou ruled out the actlve alternatlvee1 Do \nother teete need to be done to exclude the \naltemative diagnoees1 \nAlternative Diagnosis: Retropharyngeal Abscess \nTextbook Presentation \nRetropharyngeal abscess can be seen in either children or adults. \nPatients usually have symptoms similar to those seen in epiglot-\ntitis but commonly have a history of a recent upper respiratory \ninfection or trauma from recently ingested materials (bones), or \nprocedures (pulmonary or gastrointestinal endoscopy). \nDisease Highlights \nA. Symptoms that suggest retropharyngeal abscess rather than \nepiglottitis are: \n1. Patients with retropharyngeal abscesses often will sense a \nlump in their throat. \n2. Patients are often most comfortable supine with neck \nCJrtended (very different from epiglottitis). \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of retropharyngeal abscess is made when a \nthickening of the retropharyngeal tissues is seen on lateral \nneck radiographs. \nB. Radiographs are probably not I 00% sensitive, so when radio-\ngraphs are normal and clinical suspicion is high, CT scanning \nshould be done to verify the diagnosis. \nTreatment \nA. Retropharyngeal abscesses are usually polymicrobial. \nB. Treatment is both medical and surgical. \n1. Surgical drainage should be accomplished as soon as possible. \n2. Many antibiotics have been suggested. Coverage of gram-\npositive organisms and anaerobes make clindamycin a \ncommon choice. \n\nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nThe patient's lateral neck radiograph showed prol:lable acute \nepi91ottitls with a thumb sign.

She reports that \nher symptoms have been present for al:lout 2 years. She \nreports almost constant, mild dyspnea that Is worst with \nexercise or when she has a cold. Only rarely does she feel \n\"nearly normal.\" She also complains of a mild cough produc-\ntive of clear sputum. She does not feel that her cough is \nmuch of a problem as It Is significantly better since she \nstopped smoking 2 years ago. \n~~ At thl!!J point, what le the leading hypothHl!!J, \n~Jill\"' ancl what are the active alternatives? What \nother te!!Jt!!J ehould '7l!l ort:lerea1 \nRANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS \nThe pivotal points in this case are the patient's chronic dyspnea, \nwheezing, and smoking history. COPD and asthma should be high \nin the differential diagnosis. Heart failure is also a possibility. The \npatient's smoking history is a risk factor for coronary disease, the \nmost common cause of heart failure. As noted in Chapter 15, Dysp-\nnea, heart failure frequently compllcates COPD or is misdiagnosed \nas the pulmonary disease, especially when a patient presents with \ndyspnea. Bronchiectasis could cause symptoms of dyspnea, cough, \nand sputum production, but the patient's sputum production seems \nto be a minor symptom (rather than a predominant symptom as is \nusually the case in bronchiectasis). Tuberculosis should probably be \nconsidered in the differential, since it can cause chronic cough and \ndyspnea. Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, if tuberculosis \nwere the cause, weight loss and other constitutional signs would be \nexpected. Table 33-7 lists the differential diagnosis. \n\nMrs. A reports a 60 pack-year history of smoking. She \nstopped 2 years ago, after smoking 2 packs a day for \n30 years, when her chronic cough began to worry her. She \nreports that she stlll coughs but only rarely brings up \nsputum. \nShe has not experienced fever. chllls. weight loss. or \nperipheral edema. She does say that when her breathing Is \n!Jad, It Is worse when lylng down.

Mr. S was admttted to the \nICU and treated with a second-generation cephalosporin. \nCultures ofthe blood and epiglottis were negat ive. \nThe patient's infection was diagnosed on the lateral neck radio-\ngraphs. lnrubation was necessary because the patient had signs and \nsymptoms of airway obstruction.

The \nonset is usually sloand progressive with occasional acute exacer-\nbations. A long smoking history is present in almost all patients \nwith COPD who live in industrialized countries. \n\n600 I CHAPTER 33 \nDisease Highlights \nA. COPD is defined in the WHO/NHLBI Global Strategy \nfor the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic: \nObstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) as a \"disease state \ncharacterized by airflolimitation that is not fully reversible. \nThe airflolimitation is usually both progressive and associ-\nated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to \nnoxious particles or gases.\" \nB. COPD should be considered in any patient with a smoking \nhistory who has pulmonary complaints. These complaints can be: \n1. Mild {smokers' cough or lingering colds) \n2. Moderate (chronic: cough, sputum production, and \ndyspnea} \n3. Severe (activity-limiting dyspnea with life-threatening \nexacerbations} \nC. COPD can also be seen in patients without a smoking history \nbut with significant exposure to secondhand smoke, occu-\npational dust and chemicals and, especially in less developed \ncounuies, indoor air pollution from cooking stoves. \nD. Because of the wide variation in disease course, it is impossible to \ngive an average amount of exposure necessary to cause disease. \n1. Pulmonary symptoms usually develop after about 10 years \nof exposure. \n2. Airfloobstruction may develop later. \nE. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are currently being used \nless as descriptors of types of COPD. \n1. Emphysema is a pathologic term not accurately correlating \nwith its general clinical usage. \n2. Chronic: bronchitis is the presence of mucus production \nfor most days of the month, 3 months of a year, for \n2 successive years. This symptom does not suggest the \nairfloobstruction that causes the morbidity in COPD. \n3. Due to the overlap and lack of specificity of these 2 terms, \nCOPD should be used as the diagnostic: term. \nF. The GOLD staging system is often used to classify patients \nbased on their symptoms and level of risk of exacerbations. \nThe system uses symptom severity and exacerbation risk to \nclassify COPD. \n1. Symptoms, based on the Modified Medical Research \nCouncil (MMRC) dyspnea scale: \na. Grade 0: \"I only get breathless with strenuous exercise.\" \nb. Grade 1 : \"I get short of breath when hurrying on level \nground or walking up a slight hill.\" \nc. Grade 2: \"On level ground, I walk slower than people of \nthe same age because of breathlessness, or have to stop \nfor breath when walking at my own pace.\" \nd. Grade 3: \"I stop for breath after walking about 100 \nyards or after a feminutes on level ground.\" \ne. Grade 4: \"I am too breathless to leave the house or I am \nbreathless when dressing.\" \n2. Combined assessment \na. Group A is at lorisk and is less symptomatic: s 1 \nexacerbation/year, and grade 0-1 symptoms \nb. Group B is at lorisk but is more symptomatic: s 1 \nexacerbation/year, and ~ grade 2 symptoms \nc. Group C is at high risk but has fesymptoms: ~ 2 \nexacerbations/year, and grade 0-1 symptoms \nd. Group D is at high risk and has many symptoms: ~ 2 \nexacerbations/year and ~ grade 2 symptoms \nG. The BODE index, a widely available clinical decision rule, \ntakes into account other patient features, such as body mass \nindex and 6-minute walk distance, to give a 4-year mortality. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis ofCOPD is based on history, physical exam, \nand ancillary tests (primarily PFTs). \nB. History \n1. Important aspects of the history are: \na. Chronic cough \nb. Lingering colds \nc. Spurum production \nd. Dyspnea \ne. Decreased exercise tolerance \n2. Other important historical fearures that argue for airflo\nlimitation include: \na. Smoking history ~ 70 pack-years: sensitivity, 40%; \nspecificity, 95%: LR+, 8.0; LR-, 0.63. \nb. Spurum production > ~ cup: sensitivity, 20%; \nspecificity, 95%: LR+, 4; LR-, 0.84. \nC. Physical exam \nI. The physical exam is useful mainly in patients with more \nadvanced disease. \n2. No findings are sensitive enough to exclude a diagnosis of \nCOPD. \n3. The test characteristics for some of the physical exam \nfindings are listed in Table 33-8. \nThe absence of wheezing does not rule out, or \neven significantly decrease the likelihood of, \nCOPD. \nD. Combinations of historical features, signs and symptoms are \nmost effective in diagnosing COPD. \n1. There are many decision rules that aid in the diagnosis of \nCOPD. \n2. The combination of> 55 pack-year smoking history, \nwheezing on auscultation, and patient reported wheezing \ndiagnoses airfloobstruction (LR+, 156). \nTable33-8.

The absence of cigarette smoking is the most effective test \nto rule out airfloobstruction (LR-, 0.18) \nE. Spirometry \n1. Spirometry should be done in all patients with suspected \nCOPD and respiratory symptoms. \n2. Because the results of spirometry are part of the information \nrequired to make a diagnosis of COPD, test characteristics \ncannot be calculated. \n3. Although not formally incorporated into the GOLD \nstaging, airflolimitation is considered important. GOLD \nrecommends using postbronchodilator FEY1 after a patient \nmeets a threshold ofFEY/FVC of< 0.7. \na. Mild: FEY1 <!: 85% of predicted \nb. Moderate: FEY1 > 50% to < 85% of predicted \nc. Severe: FEY1 ~ 30% to ~ 50% of predicted \nd. Very severe: FEV1 < 30% of predicted \n4. Typically, PFTs in COPD reveal: \na. Increased total lung capacity secondary to decreased \nelastic recoil \nb. Increased functional residual capacity and residual \nvolume secondary to air trapping \nc. Decreased FEV1 and FVC due to airfloobstruction \nd. Decreased DLCO secondary to destruction of the \noxygen/Hb interface. \nF. Other tests \n1. Spirometrywith bronchodilator response is recommended \nto rule out asthma. Patients with completely reversible \nairfloobstruction likely have asthma. \n2. Chest radiograph is generally not useful in diagnosing COPD. \na. Some findings are suggestive \n(1) Upper lobe bullous disease (uncommon but nearly \ndiagnostic} \n(2) Flattened diaphragm on the lateral chest radiograph \n(3) Large retrostemal air space \n(4) Hyperlucency of the lungs \n(5) Diminished distal vascular markings \nb. Chest radiography is alwa}'5 recommended to rule out \nother causes of symptoms. \nG. ABG measurement is recommended in patients with FEY1 \n< 40% predicted or right-sided heart failure. \nH. Testing for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (a rare cause of \nCOPD) is recommended in patients: \n1. In whom COPD develops before age 45 years \n2. Who do not have a smoking history or suspicious exposure \nTreatment \nIn general, any patient with a smoking history \nwho complains of chronic cough, sputum pro-\nduction, or dyspnea should be considered to \nhave COPD if no other diagnosis can be made. \nAdditional testing can be used to establish the \ndiagnosis and assess severity. \nA. Management of stable disease \n1. Nonpharmacologic and preventive therapy \na. Smoking cessation and avoidance of other inhaled toxic \nagents \nWHEEZING AND STRIDOR I 601 \nSmoking cessation is more effective than any \npharmacotherapy at preserving lung function \nin patients with COPD. \nb. Exercise programs, if allowable from a cardiovascular \nstandpoint \nc. Vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal \npneumonia \n2. Pharmacologic \na. Patients with symptoms and an FEY < 60% of \npredicted benefit most from therapy. These patients \nshould be prescribed bronchodilator inhalers, such as \nlong-acting beta-agonist or anticholinergic inhalers. \nb. Patients with less severe disease may benefit from \ntreatment, especially as needed bronchodilators. \nc. Combination therapy with both long-acting beta-\nagonist and anticholinergic inhalers may improve \noutcomes in patients who do not get a sufficient \nresponse with monotherapy. \nd. Inhaled corticosteroids \n(1) Use remains somewhat controversial \n(2) There is some evidence that inhaled corticosteroids, \nused with long-acting beta-agonists or anticholinergics, \ndecrease symptoms and reduce the frequency \nof exacerbations. This is probably most true in \npatients with some reversible airway obstruction on \nspirometry. \n(3) They do not seem to affect the rate of decline in \npulmonary function and may increase rates of \npneumonia. \ne. Home oxygen is recommended for persons with chronic \nhypoxia or cor pulmonale. \nf. Patients who have exacerbations despite optimal therapy \nbenefit from antibiotic prophylaxis, usually with \nazithromycin. \nB. Management of exacerbations \n1. Evaluation \na. Patients who are likely to have the worst outcomes have \nlobaseline FEV1, Pa02, pH, and high PC02 Discharge \nof such patients fiom an emergency department should \nonly be done with great care. \nb. Exacerbating factors \n(1) Factors that may have led to the COPD exacerbation \nshould be sought and addressed during treatment. \n(2) Historical evidence of infection or exposure (air \npollution, ozone) should be sought. \n(3) All patients should have a chest radiograph to look \nfor pneumonia. \n(4) As discussed in Chapter 15, D}'5pnea, if a cause of \nthe exacerbation is not found, consideration should \nbe given to pulmonary embolism and heart failure. \nc. Unlike in the assessment of asthma exacerbations, \nspirometry is oflittle value in making admission decisions. \n2. Therapy \na. Anticholinergic and beta-agonist inhalers should be \ngiven to all patients. \nb. S}'5temic corticosteroids are effective when given for up \nto 2 weeks. For uncomplicated COPD exacerbations, a \n5-day course of corticosteroids is typically given. There \nis no evidence that inhaled corticosteroids are effective. \n\n602 I CHAPTER 33 \n3. Antibiotics are effective for more severe exacerbations. \n4. Oxygen therapy is beneficial. \na. Oxygen does carry a risk of hypercapnia and respiratory \nfailure. \nb. The development of respiratory failure is somewhat \npredictable. \nc. The following equation identifies patients who are at \nhigh risk for co2 retention and for requiring mechanical \nventilation: pH = 7 .66 - 0.00919 x PaOr If the calculated \npH is greater than the patient's true pH, he or she is at \nhigh risk for being intubated. Sensitivity is - 80%. \nIf a patient with a COPD exacerbation requires \noxygen, it should be provided and not withheld \nfor fear of causing col retention. If respiratory \nfailure does ensue, it is caused by COPD and not \nby the physician who administered the oxygen. \n5. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (eg, bilevd \npositive airway pressure) decreases rates of intubation, \nlength of stay, and in-hospital mortality in patients with \nsevere exacerbation. \n6. Mucolytics, theophylline, and chest physiotherapy have no \nrole in the treatment of COPD exacerbations. \nMAKING A DIAGNOSIS \n\nOn the physical exam, Mrs. A appears well. Her vital sl{lns \nare normal. The only findings on lung exam are decreased \nbreath sounds, a prolonged expiratory phase, and scant \nexpiratory wheezing. Her chest radiograph is normal. Some \nof the results of her PFTs are shown in Table 33-9. \nHaV1s you croe&ed a diagno&tic thnsehold for \nthe leading hyPOtheele, COPD1 Have you rul&i \nout the active alternatlvH? Do other tsete \nneed to be done to e>eclude the altsmatlve \ndlagtt09891 \nThe combination of her smoking history, reported wheezing, \nand wheezing on auscultation indicates airfloobstruction. The \nremainder of her history and physical exam support the diagnosis \nof COPD, and the chest radiograph does not argue for another \ndiagnosis. \nTable33-9.

Most importantly, there is \nan irreversible decrease in airflow. The loDLCO (carbon mon-\noxide diffusing capacity), suggests loss of a portion of the Hb/ \nair interface. She falls into GOLD, group C: high risk and fe\nsymptoms. \nAsthma and heart failure, the alternative diagnoses, are very \nunlikely. The irreversibility of the airway disease makes asthma less \nlikely. Heart failure remains a much less likely possibility because \nit is not supported by the PFTs or chest film. The lack of purulent \nsputum essentially excludes bronchiectasis, the other remaining \ndiagnosis. \nAlternative Diagnosis: Bronchiectasis \nTextbook Presentation \nDyspnea and chronic, purulent sputum production are often pres-\nent in patients with bronchiectasis. There is often a history of a \nchronic infection that has led to airway damage and dilatation. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Chronic sputum production is the hallmark of bronchiectasis. \nB. The disease is caused by the combination of an airway infec-\ntion and an inability to clear this infection because of impaired \nimmunity or anatomic abnormality (congenital or acquired). \nBronchiectasis can be the result of common (viral infection) \nor rare (Kartagener syndrome) diseases. \n1. Permssis and tuberculosis were the classic causes of \nbronchiectasis. \n2. Some of the common causes noare: \na. Postviral, often with lymphadenopathy causing airway \nobstruction \nb. Aspergillus fomigatus, mainly in association with allergic \nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis \nc. Mycobacterium avium complex infection, usually causing \nmidclle lobe disease \nd. Cystic fibrosis \nc. HN \nC. The most common bacteria isolated from the sputum of people \nwith bronchiectasis are H injlutl1.Z4t, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, \nand Smptococcus pneumoniae. \nD. Complications of the disease include hemoptysis and rarely \namyloidosis due to the chronic inflammation. \nEvidence-Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis ofbronchiectasis depends on recognizing the \nclinical symptoms (chronic sputum production) and demon-\nstrating airway damage and dilatation, usually by high-resolution \nCT scanning. \nB. Symptoms and their prevalence \n1. Dyspnea and wheezing, 75% \n2. Pleuritic chest pain, 50% \nC. Signs and their prevalence \n1. Crackles, 70% \n2. Wheezing, 34% \nD. Differentiation ofbronchiectasis from COPD can sometimes \nbe difficult because both may present with cough, spumm \nproduction, dyspnea, and airflolimitation. Important points \nin the differentiation are as follows: \n1. Sputum production is heavy and chronic in bronchiectasis, \nwhile it is only truly purulent in COPD during exacerbations. \n\n2. There is usually a smoking history associated with COPD. \n3. Spiromerry is not hdpful since bronchiectasis can cause \nboth airflolimitation and airway hyperrcactivity. \n4. Imaging (CT scan} will shodiagnostic airway changes \nin bronchiectasis. In COPD, imaging may or may not \ndemonstrate parenchymal destruction. \nTreatment \nA. Antibiotics are used both to treat flares of disease and to sup-\npress chronic infection. \nB. Pulmonary hygiene \n1. Chest physiotherapy \n2. Oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices \n3. There may be a role for bronchodilators, mucolytics, and \nanti-inflammatory medication. \nC. Surgery is mainly used to treat airway obstruction, to remove \ndestroyed and chronically infected lung tissue, and to treat \nlife-threatening hemoptysis. \nCASE RESOLUTION \n\nMrs. A is given a tiotropium inhaler, and she reports mild \nimprovement in her symptoms. A month later, a long-acting \nbeta-agonlst Inhaler Is added. This regimen produces bet-\nter control of her symptoms. Four months later, she arrives \nat the emergency department with acute worsening of her \nsymptoms at the time of an upper respiratory tract infec-\ntion. She is admitted with an exacerbation of COPD. \nREVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES \nSarcoidosis \nTextbook Presentation \nWhen lung symptoms predominate, a patient in his 20s or 30s \npresents with dyspnea, cough, and/or wheezing. The clinical pre-\nsentation may be indistinguishable from asthma. Because sarcoi-\ndosis is a multiS}'lltem disease, it may also present with symptoms \ncaused by skin, eye, heart, or neurologic involvement. It is also \noccasionally diagnosed based on chest film findings in a patient \nwithout symptoms of sarcoidosis. \nDisease Highlights \nA. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease. \nB. The etiology of sarcoidosis is unknown. It is the result of a \ncell-mediated immune reaction that causes noncaseating gran-\nulomas. It is generally thought that, for a patient to devdop \nsarcoidosis, he must have a genetic predisposition and then be \nexposed to cenain triggering antigens. \nC. The most commonly effected organs are the lungs, skin, eyes, \nhean, and CNS \n1. The lungs are affected in 90% of patients \na. Common findings are asymptomatic hilar \nlymphadenopathy, restrictive lung disease with a decreased \nDLCO, and obstructive lung disease. \nb. Patients may present with dyspnea, cough, chest pain or \nwheezing. \nWHEEZING AND STRIDOR I 603 \n2. Symptoms of skin involvement are widdy variable and \noccur in about 30% of patients. \n3. Any pan of the eye can be affected by sarcoid and about \n25% of patients with sarcoidosis have eye involvement. \n4. Cardiac sarcoidosis \na. Often not clinically apparent but commonly found on \nautopsies. \nb. Cardiac sarcoid can cause syncope, heart failure, or \nsudden death. \nc. Sarcoidosis is a common cause of \"idiopathic\" 2nd or \n3rd degree AV block in pts s 60. \nS. Neurosarcoidosis \na. Cranial nerve involvement is most common. \nb. Other common presentations of neurosarcoidosis are \nataxia, cognitive dysfunction, headache, and seizures. \nc. Sarcoidosis also can affect the pituitary gland or spinal \ncord. \nEvidence--Based Diagnosis \nA. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made when there is appropriate \nclinical suspicion and histologic evidence of noncaseating \ngranulomas. \nB. Biopsy \n1. Any accessible lesion can be biopsied. Lymph nodes and \nskin biopsies are most commonly used. \n2. Transbronchial biopsy has a diagnostic yield of 85%. \nC. When patients present with LOfgren syndrome (erythema \nnodosum, hilar adenopathy, and polyarthralgias), the \ndiagnosis of sarcoidosis is generally considered cettain \nwithout biopsy. \nD. The Siltzbach classification system is often used to describe \nsarcoidosis. \n1. Stage 0: normal appearance at chest radiography \n2. Stage 1: lymphadenopathy on chest radiography \n3. Stage 2: lymphadenopathy and parenchymal lung disease \n4. Stage 3: parenchymal lung disease only \nS. Stage 4: pulmonary fibrosis \nE. ACE levels are insensitive and nonspecific and should not be \nused for diagnosing sarcoidosis. \nTreatment \nA. Most patients with sarcoidosis do not require treatment. \nB. When patients with sarcoidosis do require treatment, it is gen-\nerally because their disease is clinically active. \nC. Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment. \nD. Methotrexate and infliximab are also considered effective and \nare used in patients who require long-term therapy. \nREFERENCES \nAaron SD, Vandemheen KL, Fergusson D et al.
